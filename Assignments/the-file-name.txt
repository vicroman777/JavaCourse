This is a book that contains stories written by Howard Phihps Lovecraft that is 3
beheved to be in the pubhc domain and were downloaded from the web. It was 3
not created for profit - only for the purpose of having the stories in a singular 3
location so as to be readily available for reading. The cover image is a 'doctored' 3
photo that I took at Saint Kevin's Monastery, Ireland. The image was altered 3

Notes On Writing Weird Fiction 3
3
H. P. Lovecraft 3
3
My reason for writing stories is to give myself the satisfaction of visualising more 3
clearly and detailedly and stably the vague, elusive, fragmentary impressions of 3
wonder, beauty, and adventurous expectancy which are conveyed to me by 3
certain sights (scenic, architectural, atmospheric, etc.), ideas, occurrences, and 3
images encountered in art and literature. I choose weird stories because they suit 3
my inclination best - one of my strongest and most persistent wishes being to 3
achieve, momentarily, the illusion of some strange suspension or violation of the 3
galling limitations of time, space, and natural law which forever imprison us and 3
frustrate our curiosity about the infinite cosmic spaces beyond the radius of our 3
sight and analysis. These stories frequently emphasise the element of horror 3
because fear is our deepest and strongest emotion, and the one which best lends 3
itself to the creation of Nature-defying illusions. Horror and the unknown or the 3
strange are always closely connected, so that it is hard to create a convincing 3
picture of shattered natural law or cosmic alienage or "outsideness" without 3
laying stress on the emotion of fear. The reason why time plays a great part in so 3
many of my tales is that this element looms up in my mind as the most 3
profoundly dramatic and grimly terrible thing in the universe. Conflict with time 3
seems to me the most potent and fruitful theme in all human expression. 3
3
While my chosen form of story-writing is obviously a special and perhaps a 3
narrow one, it is none the less a persistent and permanent type of expression, as 3
old as literature itself. There will always be a certain small percentage of persons 3
who feel a burning curiosity about unknown outer space, and a burning desire to 3
escape from the prison-house of the known and the real into those enchanted 3
lands of incredible adventure and infinite possibilities which dreams open up to 3
us, and which things like deep woods, fantastic urban towers, and flaming 3
sunsets momentarily suggest. These persons include great authors as well as 3
insignificant amateurs like myself - Dunsany, Poe, Arthur Machen, M. R. James, 3
Algernon Blackwood, and Walter de la Mare being typical masters in this field. 3
3
As to how I write a story - there is no one way. Each one of my tales has a 3
different history. Once or twice I have literally written out a dream; but usually I 3
start with a mood or idea or image which I wish to express, and revolve it in my 3
mind until I can think of a good way of embodying it in some chain of dramatic 3
occurrences capable of being recorded in concrete terms. I tend to run through a 3
mental list of the basic conditions or situations best adapted to such a mood or 3
idea or image, and then begin to speculate on logical and naturally motivated 3
3
3
3
explanations of the given mood or idea or image in terms of the basic condition 3
or situation chosen. 3
3
The actual process of writing is of course as varied as the choice of theme and 3
initial conception; but if the history of all my tales were analysed, it is just 3
possible that the following set of rules might be deduced from the average 3
procedure: 3
3
1) Prepare a synopsis or scenario of events in the order of their absolute 3
occurrence - not the order of their narration. Describe with enough fulness to 3
cover all vital points and motivate all incidents planned. Details, comments, and 3
estimates of consequences are sometimes desirable in this temporary framework 3
3
2) Prepare a second synopsis or scenario of events - this one in order of narration 3
(not actual occurrence), with ample fulness and detail, and with notes as to 3
changing perspective, stresses, and climax. Change the original synopsis to fit if 3
such a change will increase the dramatic force or general effectiveness of the 3
story. Interpolate or delete incidents at will - never being bound by the original 3
conception even if the ultimate result be a tale wholly different from that first 3
planned. Let additions and alterations be made whenever suggested by anything 3
in the for mulating process. 3
3
3) Write out the story - rapidly, fluently, and not too critically - following the 3
second or narrative-order synopsis. Change incidents and plot whenever the 3
developing process seems to suggest such change, never being bound by any 3
previous design. If the development suddenly reveals new opportunities for 3
dramatic effect or vivid story telling, add whatever is thought advantageous - 3
going back and reconciling the early parts to the new plan. Insert and delete 3
whole sections if necessary or desirable, trying different beginnings and endings 3
until the best arrangement is found. But be sure that all references throughout 3
the story are thoroughly reconciled with the final design. Remove all possible 3
superfluities - words, sentences, paragraphs, or whole episodes or elements - 3
observing the usual precautions about the reconciling of all references. 3
3
4) Revise the entire text, paying attention to vocabulary, syntax, rhythm of prose, 3
proportioning of parts, niceties of tone, grace and convincingness of transitions 3
(scene to scene, slow and detailed action to rapid and sketchy time-covering 3
action and vice versa... etc., etc., etc.), effectiveness of beginning, ending, 3
climaxes, etc., dramatic suspense and interest, plausibility and atmosphere, and 3
various other elements. 3
3
5) Prepare a neatly typed copy - not hesitating to add final revisory touches 3
where they seem in order. 3
3
3
3
The first of these stages is often purely a mental one - a set of conditions and 3
happenings being worked out in my head, and never set down until I am ready 3
to prepare a detailed synopsis of events in order of narration. Then, too, I 3
sometimes begin even the actual writing before I know how I shall develop the 3
idea - this beginning forming a problem to be motivated and exploited. 3
3
There are, I think, four distinct types of weird story; one expressing a mood or 3
feeling, another expressing a pictorial conception, a third expressing a general 3
situation, condition, legend or intellectual conception, and a fourth explaining a 3
definite tableau or specific dramatic situation or climax. In another way, weird 3
tales may be grouped into two rough categories - those in which the marvel or 3
horror concerns some condition or phenomenon, and those in which it concerns 3
some action of persons in connexion with a bizarre condition or phenomenon. 3
3
Each weird story - to speak more particularly of the horror type - seems to 3
involve five definite elements: (a) some basic, underlying horror or abnormality - 3
condition, entity, etc. - , (b) the general effects or bearings of the horror, (c) the 3
mode of manifestation - object embodying the horror and phenomena observed - 3
, (d) the types of fear-reaction pertaining to the horror, and (e) the specific effects 3
of the horror in relation to the given set of conditions. 3
3
In writing a weird story I always try very carefully to achieve the right mood and 3
atmosphere, and place the emphasis where it belongs. One cannot, except in 3
immature pulp charlatan-fiction, present an account of impossible, improbable, 3
or inconceivable phenomena as a commonplace narrative of objective acts and 3
conventional emotions. Inconceivable events and conditions have a special 3
handicap to over come, and this can be accomplished only through the 3
maintenance of a careful realism in every phase of the story except that touching 3
on the one given marvel. This marvel must be treated very impressively and 3
deliberately - with a careful emotional "build-up" - else it will seem flat and 3
unconvincing. Being the principal thing in the story, its mere existence should 3
overshadow the characters and events. But the characters and events must be 3
consistent and natural except where they touch the single marvel. In relation to 3
the central wonder, the characters should shew the same overwhelming emotion 3
which similar characters would shew toward such a wonder in real life. Never 3
have a wonder taken for granted. Even when the characters are supposed to be 3
accustomed to the wonder I try to weave an air of awe and impressiveness 3
corresponding to what the reader should feel. A casual style ruins any serious 3
fantasy. 3
3
Atmosphere, not action, is the great desideratum of weird fiction. Indeed, all that 3
a wonder story can ever be is a vivid picture of a certain type of human mood. 3
The moment it tries to be anything else it becomes cheap, puerile, and 3
3
3
3
unconvincing. Prime emphasis should be given to subtle suggestion - 3
imperceptible hints and touches of selective associative detail which express 3
shadings of moods and build up a vague illusion of the strange reality of the 3
unreal. Avoid bald catalogues of incredible happenings which can have no 3
substance or meaning apart from a sustaining cloud of colour and symbolism. 3
3
These are the rules or standards which I have followed - consciously or 3
unconsciously - ever since I first attempted the serious writing of fantasy. That 3
my results are successful may well be disputed - but I feel at least sure that, had I 3
ignored the considerations mentioned in the last few paragraphs, they would 3
have been much worse than they are. 3

History of the Necronomicon 3
3
Written 1927 3
3
Published 1938 3
3
Original title Al Azif — azif being the word used by Arabs to designate that 3
nocturnal sound (made by insects) suppos'd to be the howling of daemons. 3
3
Composed by Abdul Alhazred, a mad poet of Sanaa, in Yemen, who is said to 3
have flourished during the period of the Ommiade caliphs, circa 700 A.D. He 3
visited the ruins of Babylon and the subterranean secrets of Memphis and spent 3
ten years alone in the great southern desert of Arabia — the Roba el Khaliyeh or 3
"Empty Space" of the ancients — and "Dahna" or "Crimson" desert of the 3
modern Arabs, which is held to be inhabited by protective evil spirits and 3
monsters of death. Of this desert many strange and unbelievable marvels are told 3
by those who pretend to have penetrated it. In his last years Alhazred dwelt in 3
Damascus, where the Necronomicon (Al Azif) was written, and of his final death 3
or disappearance (738 A.D.) many terrible and conflicting things are told. He is 3
said by Ebn Khallikan (12th cent, biographer) to have been seized by an invisible 3
monster in broad daylight and devoured horribly before a large number of 3
fright-frozen witnesses. Of his madness many things are told. He claimed to have 3
seen fabulous Irem, or City of Pillars, and to have found beneath the ruins of a 3
certain nameless desert town the shocking annals and secrets of a race older than 3
mankind. He was only an indifferent Moslem, worshipping unknown entities 3
whom he called Yog-Sothoth and Cthulhu. 3
3
In A.D. 950 the Azif, which had gained a considerable tho' surreptitious 3
circulation amongst the philosophers of the age, was secretly translated into 3
Greek by Theodorus Philetas of Constantinople under the title Necronomicon. 3
For a century it impelled certain experimenters to terrible attempts, when it was 3
suppressed and burnt by the patriarch Michael. After this it is only heard of 3
furtively, but (1228) Olaus Wormius made a Latin translation later in the Middle 3
Ages, and the Latin text was printed twice — once in the fifteenth century in 3
black-letter (evidently in Germany) and once in the seventeenth (prob. Spanish) 3
— both editions being without identifying marks, and located as to time and 3
place by internal typographical evidence only. The work both Latin and Greek 3
was banned by Pope Gregory IX in 1232, shortly after its Latin translation, which 3
called attention to it. The Arabic original was lost as early as Wormius' time, as 3
indicated by his prefatory note; and no sight of the Greek copy — which was 3
printed in Italy between 1500 and 1550 — has been reported since the burning of 3
a certain Salem man's library in 1692. An English translation made by Dr. Dee 3
3
3
3
was never printed, and exists only in fragments recovered from the original 3
manuscript. Of the Latin texts now existing one (15th cent.) is known to be in the 3
British Museum under lock and key, while another (17th cent.) is in the 3
Bibliotheque Nationale at Paris. A seventeenth-century edition is in the Widener 3
Library at Harvard, and in the library of Miskatonic University at Arkham. Also 3
in the library of the University of Buenos Ayres. Numerous other copies 3
probably exist in secret, and a fifteenth-century one is persistently rumoured to 3
form part of the collection of a celebrated American millionaire. A still vaguer 3
rumour credits the preservation of a sixteenth-century Greek text in the Salem 3
family of Pickman; but if it was so preserved, it vanished with the artist R. U. 3
Pickman, who disappeared early in 1926. The book is rigidly suppressed by the 3
authorities of most countries, and by all branches of organised ecclesiasticism. 3
Reading leads to terrible consequences. It was from rumours of this book (of 3
which relatively few of the general public know) that R. W. Chambers is said to 3
have derived the idea of his early novel The King in Yellow. 3

This should be supplemented with a letter written to Clark Ashton Smith on 3
November 27, 1927: 3
3
I have had no chance to produce new material this autumn, but have been 3
classifying notes & synopses in preparation for some monstrous tales later on. In 3
particular I have drawn up some data on the celebrated & unmentionable 3
Necronomicon of the mad Arab Abdul Alhazred! It seems that this shocking 3
blasphemy was produced by a native of Sanaa, in Yemen, who flourished about 3
700 A.D. & made many mysterious pilgrimages to Babylon's ruins, Memphis's 3
catacombs, & the devil-haunted & untrodden wastes of the great southern 3
deserts of Arabia — the Roba el Khaliyeh, where he claimed to have found 3
records of things older than mankind, & to have learnt the worship of Yog- 3
Sothoth & Cthulhu. The book was a product of Abdul's old age, which was spent 3
in Damascus, & the original title was Al Azif — azif (cf. Henley's notes to 3
Vathek) being the name applied to those strange night noises (of insects) which 3
the Arabs attribute to the howling of daemons. Alhazred died — or disappeared 3
3
3
3
— under terrible circumstances in the year 738. In 950 Al Azif was translated into 3
Greek by the Byzantine Theodorus Philetas under the title Necronomicon, & a 3
century later it was burnt at the order of Michael, Patriarch of Constantinople. It 3
was translated into Latin by Olaus in 1228, but placed on the Index 3
Expurgatorius by Pope Gregory IX in 1232. The original Arabic was lost before 3
Olaus' time, & the last known Greek copy perished in Salem in 1692. The work 3
was printed in the 15th, 16th, & 17th centuries, but few copies are extant. 3
Wherever existing, it is carefully guarded for the sake of the world's welfare & 3
sanity. Once a man read through the copy in the library of Miskatonic University 3
at Arkham — read it through & fled wild-eyed into the hills. . . but that is another 3
story! 3
3
In yet another letter (to James Blish and William Miller, 1936), Lovecraft says: 3
3
You are fortunate in securing copies of the hellish and abhorred Necronomicon. 3
Are they the Latin texts printed in Germany in the fifteenth century, or the Greek 3
version printed in Italy in 1567, or the Spanish translation of 1623? Or do these 3
copies represent different texts? 3

I 3
3
I am forced into speech because men of science have refused to follow my advice 3
without knowing why. It is altogether against my will that I tell my reasons for 3
opposing this contemplated invasion of the antarctic - with its vast fossil hunt 3
and its wholesale boring and melting of the ancient ice caps. And I am the more 3
reluctant because my warning may be in vain. 3
3
Doubt of the real facts, as I must reveal them, is inevitable; yet, if I suppressed 3
what will seem extravagant and incredible, there would be nothing left. The 3
hitherto withheld photographs, both ordinary and aerial, will count in my favor, 3
for they are damnably vivid and graphic. Still, they will be doubted because of 3
the great lengths to which clever fakery can be carried. The ink drawings, of 3
course, will be jeered at as obvious impostures, notwithstanding a strangeness of 3
technique which art experts ought to remark and puzzle over. 3
3
In the end I must rely on the judgment and standing of the few scientific leaders 3
who have, on the one hand, sufficient independence of thought to weigh my data 3
on its own hideously convincing merits or in the light of certain primordial and 3
highly baffling myth cycles; and on the other hand, sufficient influence to deter 3
the exploring world in general from any rash and over-ambitious program in the 3
region of those mountains of madness. It is an unfortunate fact that relatively 3
obscure men like myself and my associates, connected only with a small 3
university, have little chance of making an impression where matters of a wildly 3
bizarre or highly controversial nature are concerned. 3
3
It is further against us that we are not, in the strictest sense, specialists in the 3
fields which came primarily to be concerned. As a geologist, my object in leading 3
the Miskatonic University Expedition was wholly that of securing deep-level 3
specimens of rock and soil from various parts of the antarctic continent, aided by 3
the remarkable drill devised by Professor Frank H. Pabodie of our engineering 3
department. I had no wish to be a pioneer in any other field than this, but I did 3
hope that the use of this new mechanical appliance at different points along 3
3
3
3
previously explored paths would bring to light materials of a sort hitherto 3
unreached by the ordinary methods of collection. 3
3
Pabodie's drilling apparatus, as the public already knows from our reports, was 3
unique and radical in its lightness, portability, and capacity to combine the 3
ordinary artesian drill principle with the principle of the small circular rock drill 3
in such a way as to cope quickly with strata of varying hardness. Steel head, 3
jointed rods, gasoline motor, collapsible wooden derrick, dynamiting 3
paraphernalia, cording, rubbish- removal auger, and sectional piping for bores 3
five inches wide and up to one thousand feet deep all formed, with needed 3
accessories, no greater load than three seven-dog sledges could carry. This was 3
made possible by the clever aluminum alloy of which most of the metal objects 3
were fashioned. Four large Dornier aeroplanes, designed especially for the 3
tremendous altitude flying necessary on the antarctic plateau and with added 3
fuel-warming and quick-starting devices worked out by Pabodie, could transport 3
our entire expedition from a base at the edge of the great ice barrier to various 3
suitable inland points, and from these points a sufficient quota of dogs would 3
serve us. 3
3
We planned to cover as great an area as one antarctic season - or longer, if 3
absolutely necessary - would permit, operating mostly in the mountain ranges 3
and on the plateau south of Ross Sea; regions explored in varying degree by 3
Shackleton, Amundsen, Scott, and Byrd. With frequent changes of camp, made 3
by aeroplane and involving distances great enough to be of geological 3
significance, we expected to unearth a quite unprecedented amount of material - 3
especially in the pre-Cambrian strata of which so narrow a range of antarctic 3
specimens had previously been secured. We wished also to obtain as great as 3
possible a variety of the upper fossiliferous rocks, since the primal life history of 3
this bleak realm of ice and death is of the highest importance to our knowledge 3
of the earth's past. That the antarctic continent was once temperate and even 3
tropical, with a teeming vegetable and animal life of which the lichens, marine 3
fauna, arachnida, and penguins of the northern edge are the only survivals, is a 3
matter of common information; and we hoped to expand that information in 3
variety, accuracy, and detail. When a simple boring revealed fossiliferous signs, 3
we would enlarge the aperture by blasting, in order to get specimens of suitable 3
size and condition. 3
3
Our borings, of varying depth according to the promise held out by the upper 3
soil or rock, were to be confined to exposed, or nearly exposed, land surfaces - 3
these inevitably being slopes and ridges because of the mile or two-mile 3
thickness of solid ice overlying the lower levels. We could not afford to waste 3
drilling the depth of any considerable amount of mere glaciation, though 3
Pabodie had worked out a plan for sinking copper electrodes in thick clusters of 3
3
3
3
borings and melting off limited areas of ice with current from a gasoline-driven 3
dynamo. It is this plan - which we could not put into effect except experimentally 3
on an expedition such as ours - that the coming Starkweather-Moore Expedition 3
proposes to follow, despite the warnings I have issued since our return from the 3
antarctic. 3
3
The public knows of the Miskatonic Expedition through our frequent wireless 3
reports to the Arkham Advertiser and Associated Press, and through the later 3
articles of Pabodie and myself. We consisted of four men from the University - 3
Pabodie, Lake of the biology department, Atwood of the physics department - 3
also a meteorologist - and myself, representing geology and having nominal 3
command - besides sixteen assistants: seven graduate students from Miskatonic 3
and nine skilled mechanics. Of these sixteen, twelve were qualified aeroplane 3
pilots, all but two of whom were competent wireless operators. Eight of them 3
understood navigation with compass and sextant, as did Pabodie, Atwood, and 3
I. In addition, of course, our two ships - wooden ex-whalers, reinforced for ice 3
conditions and having auxiliary steam - were fully manned. 3
3
The Nathaniel Derby Pickman Foundation, aided by a few special contributions, 3
financed the expedition; hence our preparations were extremely thorough, 3
despite the absence of great publicity. The dogs, sledges, machines, camp 3
materials, and unassembled parts of our five planes were delivered in Boston, 3
and there our ships were loaded. We were marvelously well-equipped for our 3
specific purposes, and in all matters pertaining to supplies, regimen, 3
transportation, and camp construction we profited by the excellent example of 3
our many recent and exceptionally brilliant predecessors. It was the unusual 3
number and fame of these predecessors which made our own expedition - ample 3
though it was - so little noticed by the world at large. 3
3
As the newspapers told, we sailed from Boston Harbor on September 2nd, 1930, 3
taking a leisurely course down the coast and through the Panama Canal, and 3
stopping at Samoa and Hobart, Tasmania, at which latter place we took on final 3
supplies. None of our exploring party had ever been in the polar regions before, 3
hence we all relied greatly on our ship captains - J. B. Douglas, commanding the 3
brig Arkham, and serving as commander of the sea party, and Georg 3
Thorfinnssen, commanding the barque Miskatonic - both veteran whalers in 3
antarctic waters. 3
3
As we left the inhabited world behind, the sun sank lower and lower in the 3
north, and stayed longer and longer above the horizon each day. At about 62° 3
South Latitude we sighted our first icebergs - table-like objects with vertical sides 3
- and just before reaching the antarctic circle, which we crossed on October 20th 3
with appropriately quaint ceremonies, we were considerably troubled with field 3
3
3
3

3
3
3
ice. The falling temperature bothered me considerably after our long voyage 3
through the tropics, but I tried to brace up for the worse rigors to come. On many 3
occasions the curious atmospheric effects enchanted me vastly; these including a 3
strikingly vivid mirage - the first I had ever seen - in which distant bergs became 3
the battlements of unimaginable cosmic castles. 3
3
Pushing through the ice, which was fortunately neither extensive nor thickly 3
packed, we regained open water at South Latitude 67°, East Longitude 175° On 3
the morning of October 26th a strong land blink appeared on the south, and 3
before noon we all felt a thrill of excitement at beholding a vast, lofty, and snow- 3
clad mountain chain which opened out and covered the whole vista ahead. At 3
last we had encountered an outpost of the great unknown continent and its 3
cryptic world of frozen death. These peaks were obviously the Admiralty Range 3
discovered by Ross, and it would now be our task to round Cape Adare and sail 3
down the east coast of Victoria Land to our contemplated base on the shore of 3
McMurdo Sound, at the foot of the volcano Erebus in South Latitude 77° 9'. 3
3
The last lap of the voyage was vivid and fancy-stirring. Great barren peaks of 3
mystery loomed up constantly against the west as the low northern sun of noon 3
or the still lower horizon-grazing southern sun of midnight poured its hazy 3
reddish rays over the white snow, bluish ice and water lanes, and black bits of 3
exposed granite slope. Through the desolate summits swept ranging, 3
intermittent gusts of the terrible antarctic wind; whose cadences sometimes held 3
vague suggestions of a wild and half-sentient musical piping, with notes 3
extending over a wide range, and which for some subconscious mnemonic 3
reason seemed to me disquieting and even dimly terrible. Something about the 3
scene reminded me of the strange and disturbing Asian paintings of Nicholas 3
Roerich, and of the still stranger and more disturbing descriptions of the evilly 3
fabled plateau of Leng which occur in the dreaded Necronomicon of the mad 3
Arab Abdul Alhazred. I was rather sorry, later on, that I had ever looked into 3
that monstrous book at the college library. 3
3
On the 7th of November, sight of the westward range having been temporarily 3
lost, we passed Franklin Island; and the next day descried the cones of Mts. 3
Erebus and Terror on Ross Island ahead, with the long line of the Parry 3
Mountains beyond. There now stretched off to the east the low, white line of the 3
great ice barrier, rising perpendicularly to a height of two hundred feet like the 3
rocky cliffs of Quebec, and marking the end of southward navigation. In the 3
afternoon we entered McMurdo Sound and stood off the coast in the lee of 3
smoking Mt. Erebus. The scoriae peak towered up some twelve thousand, seven 3
hundred feet against the eastern sky, like a Japanese print of the sacred Fujiyama, 3
while beyond it rose the white, ghostlike height of Mt. Terror, ten thousand, nine 3
hundred feet in altitude, and now extinct as a volcano. 3

3
Puffs of smoke from Erebus came intermittently, and one of the graduate 3
assistants - a brilliant young fellow named Danforth - pointed out what looked 3
like lava on the snowy slope, remarking that this mountain, discovered in 1840, 3
had undoubtedly been the source of Poe's image when he wrote seven years 3
later: 3
3
the lavas 3
3
Their sulphurous 3
3
In the ultimate 3
3
That groan as they 3
3
In the realms of the boreal pole. 3
3
Danforth was a great reader of bizarre material, and had talked a good deal of 3
Poe. I was interested myself because of the antarctic scene of Poe's only long 3
story - the disturbing and enigmatical Arthur Gordon Pym. On the barren shore, 3
and on the lofty ice barrier in the background, myriads of grotesque penguins 3
squawked and flapped their fins, while many fat seals were visible on the water, 3
swimming or sprawling across large cakes of slowly drifting ice. 3
3
Using small boats, we effected a difficult landing on Ross Island shortly after 3
midnight on the morning of the 9th, carrying a line of cable from each of the 3
ships and preparing to unload supplies by means of a breeches-buoy 3
arrangement. Our sensations on first treading Antarctic soil were poignant and 3
complex, even though at this particular point the Scott and Shackleton 3
expeditions had preceded us. Our camp on the frozen shore below the volcano's 3
slope was only a provisional one, headquarters being kept aboard the Arkham. 3
We landed all our drilling apparatus, dogs, sledges, tents, provisions, gasoline 3
tanks, experimental ice-melting outfit, cameras, both ordinary and aerial, 3
aeroplane parts, and other accessories, including three small portable wireless 3
outfits - besides those in the planes - capable of communicating with the 3
Arkham's large outfit from any part of the antarctic continent that we would be 3
likely to visit. The ship's outfit, communicating with the outside world, was to 3
convey press reports to the Arkham Advertiser's powerful wireless station on 3
Kingsport Head, Massachusetts. We hoped to complete our work during a single 3
antarctic summer; but if this proved impossible, we would winter on the 3
Arkham, sending the Miskatonic north before the freezing of the ice for another 3
summer's supplies. 3
3
I need not repeat what the newspapers have already published about our early 3
work: of our ascent of Mt. Erebus; our successful mineral borings at several 3
points on Ross Island and the singular speed with which Pabodie's apparatus 3
accomplished them, even through solid rock layers; our provisional test of the 3
small ice-melting equipment; our perilous ascent of the great barrier with sledges 3
3
3
3
12 3
3
3
3
and supplies; and our final assembling of five huge aeroplanes at the camp atop 3
the barrier. The health of our land party - twenty men and fifty-five Alaskan 3
sledge dogs - was remarkable, though of course we had so far encountered no 3
really destructive temperatures or windstorms. For the most part, the 3
thermometer varied between zero and 20° or 25° above, and our experience with 3
New England winters had accustomed us to rigors of this sort. The barrier camp 3
was semi-permanent, and destined to be a storage cache for gasoline, provisions, 3
dynamite, and other supplies. 3
3
Only four of our planes were needed to carry the actual exploring material, the 3
fifth being left with a pilot and two men from the ships at the storage cache to 3
form a means of reaching us from the Arkham in case all our exploring planes 3
were lost. Later, when not using all the other planes for moving apparatus, we 3
would employ one or two in a shuttle transportation service between this cache 3
and another permanent base on the great plateau from six hundred to seven 3
hundred miles southward, beyond Beardmore Glacier. Despite the almost 3
unanimous accounts of appalling winds and tempests that pour down from the 3
plateau, we determined to dispense with intermediate bases, taking our chances 3
in the interest of economy and probable efficiency. 3
3
Wireless reports have spoken of the breathtaking, four-hour, nonstop flight of 3
our squadron on November 21st over the lofty shelf ice, with vast peaks rising on 3
the west, and the unfathomed silences echoing to the sound of our engines. Wind 3
troubled us only moderately, and our radio compasses helped us through the 3
one opaque fog we encountered. When the vast rise loomed ahead, between 3
Latitudes 83° and 84°, we knew we had reached Beardmore Glacier, the largest 3
valley glacier in the world, and that the frozen sea was now giving place to a 3
frowning and mountainous coast line. At last we were truly entering the white, 3
aeon-dead world of the ultimate south. Even as we realized it we saw the peak of 3
Mt. Nansen in the eastern distance, towering up to its height of almost fifteen 3
thousand feet. 3
3
The successful establishment of the southern base above the glacier in Latitude 3
86° 7', East Longitude 174° 23', and the phenomenally rapid and effective borings 3
and blastings made at various points reached by our sledge trips and short 3
aeroplane flights, are matters of history; as is the arduous and triumphant ascent 3
of Mt. Nansen by Pabodie and two of the graduate students - Gedney and 3
Carroll - on December 13 - 15. We were some eight thousand, five hundred feet 3
above sea-level, and when experimental drillings revealed solid ground only 3
twelve feet down through the snow and ice at certain points, we made 3
considerable use of the small melting apparatus and sunk bores and performed 3
dynamiting at many places where no previous explorer had ever thought of 3
securing mineral specimens. The pre-Cambrian granites and beacon sandstones 3
3
3
3
13 3
3
3
3
thus obtained confirmed our belief that this plateau was homogeneous, with the 3
great bulk of the continent to the west, but somewhat different from the parts 3
lying eastward below South America - which we then thought to form a separate 3
and smaller continent divided from the larger one by a frozen junction of Ross 3
and Weddell Seas, though Byrd has since disproved the hypothesis. 3
3
In certain of the sandstones, dynamited and chiseled after boring revealed their 3
nature, we found some highly interesting fossil markings and fragments; notably 3
ferns, seaweeds, trilobites, crinoids, and such moUusks as linguellae and 3
gastropods - all of which seemed of real significance in connection with the 3
region's primordial history. There was also a queer triangular, striated marking, 3
about a foot in greatest diameter, which Lake pieced together from three 3
fragments of slate brought up from a deep-blasted aperture. These fragments 3
came from a point to the westward, near the Queen Alexandra Range; and Lake, 3
as a biologist, seemed to find their curious marking unusually puzzling and 3
provocative, though to my geological eye it looked not unlike some of the ripple 3
effects reasonably common in the sedimentary rocks. Since slate is no more than 3
a metamorphic formation into which a sedimentary stratum is pressed, and since 3
the pressure itself produces odd distorting effects on any markings which may 3
exist, I saw no reason for extreme wonder over the striated depression. 3
3
On January 6th, 1931, Lake, Pabodie, Danforth, the other six students, and myself 3
flew directly over the south pole in two of the great planes, being forced down 3
once by a sudden high wind, which, fortunately, did not develop into a typical 3
storm. This was, as the papers have stated, one of several observation flights, 3
during others of which we tried to discern new topographical features in areas 3
unreached by previous explorers. Our early flights were disappointing in this 3
latter respect, though they afforded us some magnificent examples of the richly 3
fantastic and deceptive mirages of the polar regions, of which our sea voyage 3
had given us some brief foretastes. Distant mountains floated in the sky as 3
enchanted cities, and often the whole white world would dissolve into a gold, 3
silver, and scarlet land of Dunsanian dreams and adventurous expectancy under 3
the magic of the low midnight sun. On cloudy days we had considerable trouble 3
in flying owing to the tendency of snowy earth and sky to merge into one 3
mystical opalescent void with no visible horizon to mark the junction of the two. 3
3
At length we resolved to carry out our original plan of flying five hundred miles 3
eastward with all four exploring planes and establishing a fresh sub-base at a 3
point which would probably be on the smaller continental division, as we 3
mistakenly conceived it. Geological specimens obtained there would be desirable 3
for purposes of comparison. Our health so far had remained excellent - lime juice 3
well offsetting the steady diet of tinned and salted food, and temperatures 3
generally above zero enabling us to do without our thickest furs. It was now 3
3
3
3
14 3
3
3
3
midsummer, and with haste and care we might be able to conclude work by 3
March and avoid a tedious wintering through the long antarctic night. Several 3
savage windstorms had burst upon us from the west, but we had escaped 3
damage through the skill of Atwood in devising rudimentary aeroplane shelters 3
and windbreaks of heavy snow blocks, and reinforcing the principal camp 3
buildings with snow. Our good luck and efficiency had indeed been almost 3
uncanny. 3
3
The outside world knew, of course, of our program, and was told also of Lake's 3
strange and dogged insistence on a westward - or rather, northwestward - 3
prospecting trip before our radical shift to the new base. It seems that he had 3
pondered a great deal, and with alarmingly radical daring, over that triangular 3
striated marking in the slate; reading into it certain contradictions in nature and 3
geological period which whetted his curiosity to the utmost, and made him avid 3
to sink more borings and blastings in the west- stretching formation to which the 3
exhumed fragments evidently belonged. He was strangely convinced that the 3
marking was the print of some bulky, unknown, and radically unclassifiable 3
organism of considerably advanced evolution, notwithstanding that the rock 3
which bore it was of so vastly ancient a date - Cambrian if not actually pre- 3
Cambrian - as to preclude the probable existence not only of all highly evolved 3
life, but of any life at all above the unicellular or at most the trilobite stage. These 3
fragments, with their odd marking, must have been five hundred million to a 3
thousand million years old. 3
3
II 3
3
Popular imagination, I judge, responded actively to our wireless bulletins of 3
Lake's start northwestward into regions never trodden by human foot or 3
penetrated by human imagination, though we did not mention his wild hopes of 3
revolutionizing the entire sciences of biology and geology. His preliminary 3
sledging and boring journey of January 11th to 18th with Pabodie and five others 3
- marred by the loss of two dogs in an upset when crossing one of the great 3
pressure ridges in the ice - had brought up more and more of the Archaean slate; 3
and even I was interested by the singular profusion of evident fossil markings in 3
that unbelievably ancient stratum. These markings, however, were of very 3
primitive life forms involving no great paradox except that any life forms should 3
occur in rock as definitely pre-Cambrian as this seemed to be; hence I still failed 3
to see the good sense of Lake's demand for an interlude in our time- saving 3
program - an interlude requiring the use of all four planes, many men, and the 3
whole of the expedition's mechanical apparatus. I did not, in the end, veto the 3
plan, though I decided not to accompany the northwestward party despite 3
Lake's plea for my geological advice. While they were gone, I would remain at 3
the base with Pabodie and five men and work out final plans for the eastward 3
3
3
3
15 3
3
3
3
shift. In preparation for this transfer, one of the planes had begun to move up a 3
good gasohne supply from McMurdo Sound; but this could wait temporarily. I 3
kept with me one sledge and nine dogs, since it is unwise to be at any time 3
without possible transportation in an utterly tenantless world of aeon-long 3
death. 3
3
Lake's sub-expedition into the unknown, as everyone will recall, sent out its own 3
reports from the shortwave transmitters on the planes; these being 3
simultaneously picked up by our apparatus at the southern base and by the 3
Arkham at McMurdo Sound, whence they were relayed to the outside world on 3
wave lengths up to fifty meters. The start was made January 22nd at 4 A.M., and 3
the first wireless message we received came only two hours later, when Lake 3
spoke of descending and starting a small- scale ice-melting and bore at a point 3
some three hundred miles away from us. Six hours after that a second and very 3
excited message told of the frantic, beaver-like work whereby a shallow shaft 3
had been sunk and blasted, culminating in the discovery of slate fragments with 3
several markings approximately like the one which had caused the original 3
puzzlement. 3
3
Three hours later a brief bulletin announced the resumption of the flight in the 3
teeth of a raw and piercing gale; and when I dispatched a message of protest 3
against further hazards. Lake replied curtly that his new specimens made any 3
hazard worth taking. I saw that his excitement had reached the point of mutiny, 3
and that I could do nothing to check this headlong risk of the whole expedition's 3
success; but it was appalling to think of his plunging deeper and deeper into that 3
treacherous and sinister white immensity of tempests and unfathomed mysteries 3
which stretched off for some fifteen hundred miles to the half-known, half- 3
suspected coast line of Queen Mary and Knox Lands. 3
3
Then, in about an hour and a half more, came that doubly excited message from 3
Lake's moving plane, which almost reversed my sentiments and made me wish I 3
had accompanied the party: 3
3
"10:05 P.M. On the wing. After snowstorm, have spied mountain range ahead 3
higher than any hitherto seen. May equal Himalayas, allowing for height of 3
plateau. Probable Latitude 76° 15', Longitude 113° 10' E. Reaches far as can see to 3
right and left. Suspicion of two smoking cones. All peaks black and bare of snow. 3
Gale blowing off them impedes navigation." 3
3
After that Pabodie, the men and I hung breathlessly over the receiver. Thought of 3
this titanic mountain rampart seven hundred miles away inflamed our deepest 3
sense of adventure; and we rejoiced that our expedition, if not ourselves 3
personally, had been its discoverers. In half an hour Lake called us again: 3
3
3
3
16 3
3
3
3
"Moulton's plane forced down on plateau in foothills, but nobody hurt and 3
perhaps can repair. Shall transfer essentials to other three for return or further 3
moves if necessary, but no more heavy plane travel needed just now. Mountains 3
surpass anything in imagination. Am going up scouting in Carroll's plane, with 3
all weight out. 3
3
"You can't imagine anything like this. Highest peaks must go over thirty-five 3
thousand feet. Everest out of the running. Atwood to work out height with 3
theodolite while Carroll and I go up. Probably wrong about cones, for formations 3
look stratified. Possibly pre-Cambrian slate with other strata mixed in. Queer 3
skyline effects - regular sections of cubes clinging to highest peaks. Whole thing 3
marvelous in red-gold light of low sun. Like land of mystery in a dream or 3
gateway to forbidden world of untrodden wonder. Wish you were here to 3
study." 3
3
Though it was technically sleeping time, not one of us listeners thought for a 3
moment of retiring. It must have been a good deal the same at McMurdo Sound, 3
where the supply cache and the Arkham were also getting the messages; for 3
Captain Douglas gave out a call congratulating everybody on the important find, 3
and Sherman, the cache operator, seconded his sentiments. We were sorry, of 3
course, about the damaged aeroplane, but hoped it could be easily mended. 3
Then, at 11 P.M., came another call from Lake: 3
3
"Up with Carroll over highest foothills. Don't dare try really tall peaks in present 3
weather, but shall later. Frightful work climbing, and hard going at this altitude, 3
but worth it. Great range fairly solid, hence can't get any glimpses beyond. Main 3
summits exceed Himalayas, and very queer. Range looks like pre-Cambrian 3
slate, with plain signs of many other upheaved strata. Was wrong about 3
volcanism. Goes farther in either direction than we can see. Swept clear of snow 3
above about twenty-one thousand feet. 3
3
"Odd formations on slopes of highest mountains. Great low square blocks with 3
exactly vertical sides, and rectangular lines of low, vertical ramparts, like the old 3
Asian castles clinging to steep mountains in Roerich's paintings. Impressive from 3
distance. Flew close to some, and Carroll thought they were formed of smaller 3
separate pieces, but that is probably weathering. Most edges crumbled and 3
rounded off as if exposed to storms and climate changes for millions of years. 3
"Parts, especially upper parts, seem to be of lighter-colored rock than any visible 3
strata on slopes proper, hence of evidently crystalline origin. Close flying shows 3
many cave mouths, some unusually regular in outline, square or semicircular. 3
You must come and investigate. Think I saw rampart squarely on top of one 3
peak. Height seems about thirty thousand to thirty-five thousand feet. Am up 3
twenty-one thousand, five hundred myself, in devilish, gnawing cold. Wind 3
3
3
3
17 3
3
3
3
whistles and pipes through passes and in and out of caves, but no flying danger 3
so far." 3
3
From then on for another half hour Lake kept up a running fire of comment, and 3
expressed his intention of climbing some of the peaks on foot. I replied that I 3
would join him as soon as he could send a plane, and that Pabodie and I would 3
work out the best gasoline plan - just where and how to concentrate our supply 3
in view of the expedition's altered character. Obviously, Lake's boring 3
operations, as well as his aeroplane activities, would require a great deal for the 3
new base which he planned to establish at the foot of the mountains; and it was 3
possible that the eastward flight might not be made, after all, this season. In 3
connection with this business I called Captain Douglas and asked him to get as 3
much as possible out of the ships and up the barrier with the single dog team we 3
had left there. A direct route across the unknown region between Lake and 3
McMurdo Sound was what we really ought to establish. 3
3
Lake called me later to say that he had decided to let the camp stay where 3
Moulton's plane had been forced down, and where repairs had already 3
progressed somewhat. The ice sheet was very thin, with dark ground here and 3
there visible, and he would sink some borings and blasts at that very point before 3
making any sledge trips or climbing expeditions. He spoke of the ineffable 3
majesty of the whole scene, and the queer state of his sensations at being in the 3
lee of vast, silent pinnacles whose ranks shot up like a wall reaching the sky at 3
the world's rim. Atwood's theodolite observations had placed the height of the 3
five tallest peaks at from thirty thousand to thirty-four thousand feet. The 3
windswept nature of the terrain clearly disturbed Lake, for it argued the 3
occasional existence of prodigious gales, violent beyond anything we had so far 3
encountered. His camp lay a little more than five miles from where the higher 3
foothills rose abruptly. I could almost trace a note of subconscious alarm in his 3
words-flashed across a glacial void of seven hundred miles - as he urged that we 3
all hasten with the matter and get the strange, new region disposed of as soon as 3
possible. He was about to rest now, after a continuous day's work of almost 3
unparalleled speed, strenuousness, and results. 3
3
In the morning I had a three-cornered wireless talk with Lake and Captain 3
Douglas at their widely separated bases. It was agreed that one of Lake's planes 3
would come to my base for Pabodie, the five men, and myself, as well as for all 3
the fuel it could carry. The rest of the fuel question, depending on our decision 3
about an easterly trip, could wait for a few days, since Lake had enough for 3
immediate camp heat and borings. Eventually the old southern base ought to be 3
restocked, but if we postponed the easterly trip we would not use it till the next 3
summer, and, meanwhile. Lake must send a plane to explore a direct route 3
between his new mountains and McMurdo Sound. 3
3
3
3
18 3
3
3
3
Pabodie and I prepared to close our base for a short or long period, as the case 3
might be. If we wintered in the antarctic we would probably fly straight from 3
Lake's base to the Arkham without returning to this spot. Some of our conical 3
tents had already been reinforced by blocks of hard snow, and now we decided 3
to complete the job of making a permanent village. Owing to a very liberal tent 3
supply. Lake had with him all that his base would need, even after our arrival. I 3
wirelessed that Pabodie and I would be ready for the northwestward move after 3
one day's work and one night's rest. 3
3
Our labors, however, were not very steady after 4 P.M., for about that time Lake 3
began sending in the most extraordinary and excited messages. His working day 3
had started unpropitiously, since an aeroplane survey of the nearly-exposed rock 3
surfaces showed an entire absence of those Archaean and primordial strata for 3
which he was looking, and which formed so great a part of the colossal peaks 3
that loomed up at a tantalizing distance from the camp. Most of the rocks 3
glimpsed were apparently Jurassic and Comanchian sandstones and Permian 3
and Triassic schists, with now and then a glossy black outcropping suggesting a 3
hard and slaty coal. This rather discouraged Lake, whose plans all hinged on 3
unearthing specimens more than five hundred million years older. It was clear to 3
him that in order to recover the Archaean slate vein in which he had found the 3
odd markings, he would have to make a long sledge trip from these foothills to 3
the steep slopes of the gigantic mountains themselves. 3
3
He had resolved, nevertheless, to do some local boring as part of the expedition's 3
general program; hence he set up the drill and put five men to work with it while 3
the rest finished settling the camp and repairing the damaged aeroplane. The 3
softest visible rock - a sandstone about a quarter of a mile from the camp - had 3
been chosen for the first sampling; and the drill made excellent progress without 3
much supplementary blasting. It was about three hours afterward, following the 3
first really heavy blast of the operation, that the shouting of the drill crew was 3
heard; and that young Gedney - the acting foreman - rushed into the camp with 3
the startling news. 3
3
They had struck a cave. Early in the boring the sandstone had given place to a 3
vein of Comanchian limestone, full of minute fossil cephalopods, corals, echini, 3
and spirifera, and with occasional suggestions of siliceous sponges and marine 3
vertebrate bones - the latter probably of teleosts, sharks, and ganoids. This, in 3
itself, was important enough, as affording the first vertebrate fossils the 3
expedition had yet secured; but when shortly afterward the drill head dropped 3
through the stratum into apparent vacancy, a wholly new and doubly intense 3
wave of excitement spread among the excavators. A good-sized blast had laid 3
open the subterrene secret; and now, through a jagged aperture perhaps five feet 3
across and three feet thick, there yawned before the avid searchers a section of 3
3
3
3
19 3
3
3
3
shallow limestone hollowing worn more than fifty million years ago by the 3
trickling ground waters of a bygone tropic world. 3
3
The hollowed layer was not more than seven or eight feet deep but extended off 3
indefinitely in all directions and had a fresh, slightly moving air which suggested 3
its membership in an extensive subterranean system. Its roof and floor were 3
abundantly equipped with large stalactites and stalagmites, some of which met 3
in columnar form: but important above all else was the vast deposit of shells and 3
bones, which in places nearly choked the passage. Washed down from unknown 3
jungles of Mesozoic tree ferns and fungi, and forests of Tertiary cycads, fan 3
palms, and primitive angiosperms, this osseous medley contained 3
representatives of more Cretaceous, Eocene, and other animal species than the 3
greatest paleontologist could have counted or classified in a year. Mollusks, 3
crustacean armor, fishes, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and early mammals - great 3
and small, known and unknown. No wonder Gedney ran back to the camp 3
shouting, and no wonder everyone else dropped work and rushed headlong 3
through the biting cold to where the tall derrick marked a new-found gateway to 3
secrets of inner earth and vanished aeons. 3
3
When Lake had satisfied the first keen edge of his curiosity, he scribbled a 3
message in his notebook and had young Moulton run back to the camp to 3
dispatch it by wireless. This was my first word of the discovery, and it told of the 3
identification of early shells, bones of ganoids and placoderms, remnants of 3
labyrinthodonts and thecodonts, great mosasaur skull fragments, dinosaur 3
vertebrae and armor plates, pterodactyl teeth and wing bones, Archaeopteryx 3
debris, Miocene sharks' teeth, primitive bird skulls, and other bones of archaic 3
mammals such as palaeotheres, Xiphodons, Eohippi, Oreodons, and titanotheres. 3
There was nothing as recent as a mastodon, elephant, true camel, deer, or bovine 3
animal; hence Lake concluded that the last deposits had occurred during the 3
Oligocene Age, and that the hollowed stratum had lain in its present dried, dead, 3
and inaccessible state for at least thirty million years. 3
3
On the other hand, the prevalence of very early life forms was singular in the 3
highest degree. Though the limestone formation was, on the evidence of such 3
typical imbedded fossils as ventriculites, positively and unmistakably 3
Comanchian and not a particle earlier, the free fragments in the hollow space 3
included a surprising proportion from organisms hitherto considered as peculiar 3
to far older periods - even rudimentary fishes, mollusks, and corals as remote as 3
the Silunan or Ordovician. The inevitable inference was that in this part of the 3
world there had been a remarkable and unique degree of continuity between the 3
life of over three hundred million years ago and that of only thirty million years 3
ago. How far this continuity had extended beyond the Oligocene Age when the 3
cavern was closed was of course past all speculation. In any event, the coming of 3
3
3
3
20 3
3
3
3
the frightful ice in the Pleistocene some five hundred thousand years ago - a 3
mere yesterday as compared with the age of this cavity - must have put an end to 3
any of the primal forms which had locally managed to outlive their common 3
terms. 3
3
Lake was not content to let his first message stand, but had another bulletin 3
written and dispatched across the snow to the camp before Moulton could get 3
back. After that Moulton stayed at the wireless in one of the planes, transmitting 3
to me - and to the Arkham for relaying to the outside world - the frequent 3
postscripts which Lake sent him by a succession of messengers. Those who 3
followed the newspapers will remember the excitement created among men of 3
science by that afternoon's reports - reports which have finally led, after all these 3
years, to the organization of that very Starkweather-Moore Expedition which I 3
am so anxious to dissuade from its purposes. I had better give the messages 3
literally as Lake sent them, and as our base operator McTighe translated them 3
from the pencil shorthand: 3
3
"Fowler makes discovery of highest importance in sandstone and limestone 3
fragments from blasts. Several distinct triangular striated prints like those in 3
Archaean slate, proving that source survived from over six hundred million 3
years ago to Comanchian times without more than moderate morphological 3
changes and decrease in average size. Comanchian prints apparently more 3
primitive or decadent, if anything, than older ones. Emphasize importance of 3
discovery in press. Will mean to biology what Einstein has meant to mathematics 3
and physics. Joins up with my previous work and amplifies conclusions. 3
3
"Appears to indicate, as I suspected, that earth has seen whole cycle or cycles of 3
organic life before known one that begins with Archaeozoic cells. Was evolved 3
and specialized not later than a thousand million years ago, when planet was 3
young and recently uninhabitable for any life forms or normal protoplasmic 3
structure. Question arises when, where, and how development took place." 3
3
"Later. Examining certain skeletal fragments of large land and marine saurians 3
and primitive mammals, find singular local wounds or injuries to bony structure 3
not attributable to any known predatory or carnivorous animal of any period, of 3
two sorts - straight, penetrant bores, and apparently hacking incisions. One or 3
two cases of cleanly severed bones. Not many specimens affected. Am sending to 3
camp for electric torches. Will extend search area underground by hacking away 3
stalactites." 3
3
"Still later. Have found peculiar soapstone fragment about six inches across and 3
an inch and a half thick, wholly unlike any visible local formation - greenish, but 3
no evidences to place its period. Has curious smoothness and regularity. Shaped 3
3
3
3
21 3
3
3
3
like five-pointed star with tips broken off, and signs of other cleavage at inward 3
angles and in center of surface. Small, smooth depression in center of unbroken 3
surface. Arouses much curiosity as to source and weathering. Probably some 3
freak of water action. Carroll, with magnifier, thinks he can make out additional 3
markings of geologic significance. Groups of tiny dots in regular patterns. Dogs 3
growing uneasy as we work, and seem to hate this soapstone. Must see if it has 3
any peculiar odor. Will report again when Mills gets back with light and we start 3
on underground area." 3
3
"10:15 P.M. Important discovery. Orrendorf and Watkins, working underground 3
at 9:45 with light, found monstrous barrel-shaped fossil of wholly unknown 3
nature; probably vegetable unless overgrown specimen of unknown marine 3
radiata. Tissue evidently preserved by mineral salts. Tough as leather, but 3
astonishing flexibility retained in places. Marks of broken-off parts at ends and 3
around sides. Six feet end to end, three and five- tenths feet central diameter, 3
tapering to one foot at each end. Like a barrel with five bulging ridges in place of 3
staves. Lateral breakages, as of thinnish stalks, are at equator in middle of these 3
ridges. In furrows between ridges are curious growths - combs or wings that fold 3
up and spread out like fans. All greatly damaged but one, which gives almost 3
seven-foot wing spread. Arrangement reminds one of certain monsters of primal 3
myth, especially fabled Elder Things in Necronomicon. 3
3
"Their wings seem to be membranous, stretched on frame work of glandular 3
tubing. Apparent minute orifices in frame tubing at wing tips. Ends of body 3
shriveled, giving no clue to interior or to what has been broken off there. Must 3
dissect when we get back to camp. Can't decide whether vegetable or animal. 3
Many features obviously of almost incredible primitiveness. Have set all hands 3
cutting stalactites and looking for further specimens. Additional scarred bones 3
found, but these must wait. Having trouble with dogs. They can't endure the 3
new specimen, and would probably tear it to pieces if we didn't keep it at a 3
distance from them." 3
3
"11:30 P.M. Attention, Dyer, Pabodie, Douglas. Matter of highest - I might say 3
transcendent - importance. Arkham must relay to Kingsport Head Station at 3
once. Strange barrel growth is the Archaean thing that left prints in rocks. Mills, 3
Boudreau, and Fowler discover cluster of thirteen more at underground point 3
forty feet from aperture. Mixed with curiously rounded and configured 3
soapstone fragments smaller than one previously found - star-shaped, but no 3
marks of breakage except at some of the points. 3
3
"Of organic specimens, eight apparently perfect, with all appendages. Have 3
brought all to surface, leading off dogs to distance. They cannot stand the things. 3
3
3
3
22 3
3
3
3
Give close attention to description and repeat back for accuracy Papers must get 3
this right. 3
3
"Objects are eight feet long all over. Six-foot, five-ridged barrel torso three and 3
five-tenths feet central diameter, one foot end diameters. Dark gray, flexible, and 3
infinitely tough. Seven-foot membranous wings of same color, found folded, 3
spread out of furrows between ridges. Wing framework tubular or glandular, of 3
lighter gray, with orifices at wing tips. Spread wings have serrated edge. Around 3
equator, one at central apex of each of the five vertical, stave-like ridges are five 3
systems of light gray flexible arms or tentacles found tightly folded to torso but 3
expansible to maximum length of over three feet. Like arms of primitive crinoid. 3
Single stalks three inches diameter branch after six inches into five substalks, 3
each of which branches after eight inches into small, tapering tentacles or 3
tendrils, giving each stalk a total of twenty-five tentacles. 3
3
"At top of torso blunt, bulbous neck of lighter gray, with gill-like suggestions, 3
holds yellowish five-pointed starfish-shaped apparent head covered with three- 3
inch wiry cilia of various prismatic colors. 3
3
"Head thick and puffy, about two feet point to point, with three-inch flexible 3
yellowish tubes projecting from each point. Slit in exact center of top probably 3
breathing aperture. At end of each tube is spherical expansion where yellowish 3
membrane rolls back on handling to reveal glassy, red-irised globe, evidently an 3
eye. 3
3
"Five slightly longer reddish tubes start from inner angles of starfish-shaped 3
head and end in saclike swellings of same color which, upon pressure, open to 3
bell-shaped orifices two inches maximum diameter and lined with sharp, white 3
tooth like projections - probably mouths. All these tubes, cilia, and points of 3
starfish head, found folded tightly down; tubes and points clinging to bulbous 3
neck and torso. Flexibility surprising despite vast toughness. 3
3
"At bottom of torso, rough but dissimilarly functioning counterparts of head 3
arrangements exist. Bulbous light-gray pseudo-neck, without gill suggestions, 3
holds greenish five-pointed starfish arrangement. 3
3
"Tough, muscular arms four feet long and tapering from seven inches diameter 3
at base to about two and five-tenths at point. To each point is attached small end 3
of a greenish five- veined membranous triangle eight inches long and six wide at 3
farther end. This is the paddle, fin, or pseudofoot which has made prints in rocks 3
from a thousand million to fifty or sixty million years old. 3
3
3
3
23 3
3
3
3
"From inner angles of starfish arrangement project two-foot reddish tubes 3
tapering from three inches diameter at base to one at tip. Orifices at tips. All 3
these parts infinitely tough and leathery, but extremely flexible. Four-foot arms 3
with paddles undoubtedly used for locomotion of some sort, marine or 3
otherwise. When moved, display suggestions of exaggerated muscularity. As 3
found, all these projections tightly folded over pseudoneck and end of torso, 3
corresponding to projections at other end. 3
3
"Cannot yet assign positively to animal or vegetable kingdom, but odds now 3
favor animal. Probably represents incredibly advanced evolution of radiata 3
without loss of certain primitive features. Echinoderm resemblances 3
unmistakable despite local contradictory evidences. 3
3
"Wing structure puzzles in view of probable marine habitat, but may have use in 3
water navigation. Symmetry is curiously vegetablelike, suggesting vegetable 's 3
essential up-and- down structure rather than animal's fore-and-aft structure. 3
Fabulously early date of evolution, preceding even simplest Archaean protozoa 3
hitherto known, baffles all conjecture as to origin. 3
3
"Complete specimens have such uncanny resemblance to certain creatures of 3
primal myth that suggestion of ancient existence outside antarctic becomes 3
inevitable. Dyer and Pabodie have read Necronomicon and seen Clark Ashton 3
Smith's nightmare paintings based on text, and will understand when I speak of 3
Elder Things supposed to have created all earth life as jest or mistake. Students 3
have always thought conception formed from morbid imaginative treatment of 3
very ancient tropical radiata. Also like prehistoric folklore things Wilmarth has 3
spoken of - Cthulhu cult appendages, etc. 3
3
"Vast field of study opened. Deposits probably of late Cretaceous or early Eocene 3
period, judging from associated specimens. Massive stalagmites deposited above 3
them. Hard work hewing out, but toughness prevented damage. State of 3
preservation miraculous, evidently owing to limestone action. No more found so 3
far, but will resume search later. Job now to get fourteen huge specimens to camp 3
without dogs, which bark furiously and can't be trusted near them. 3
3
"With nine men - three left to guard the dogs - we ought to manage the three 3
sledges fairly well, though wind is bad. Must establish plane communication 3
with McMurdo Sound and begin shipping material. But I've got to dissect one of 3
these things before we take any rest. Wish I had a real laboratory here. Dyer 3
better kick himself for having tried to stop my westward trip. First the world's 3
greatest mountains, and then this. If this last isn't the high spot of the expedition, 3
I don't know what is. We're made scientifically. Congrats, Pabodie, on the drill 3
that opened up the cave. Now will Arkham please repeat description?" 3
3
3
3
24 3
3
3
3
The sensations of Pabodie and myself at receipt of this report were almost 3
beyond description, nor were our companions much behind us in enthusiasm. 3
McTighe, who had hastily translated a few high spots as they came from the 3
droning receiving set, wrote out the entire message from his shorthand version 3
as soon as Lake's operator signed off. All appreciated the epoch-making 3
significance of the discovery, and I sent Lake congratulations as soon as the 3
Arkham's operator had repeated back the descriptive parts as requested; and my 3
example was followed by Sherman from his station at the McMurdo Sound 3
supply cache, as well as by Captain Douglas of the Arkham. Later, as head of the 3
expedition, I added some remarks to be relayed through the Arkham to the 3
outside world. Of course, rest was an absurd thought amidst this excitement; and 3
my only wish was to get to Lake's camp as quickly as I could. It disappointed me 3
when he sent word that a rising mountain gale made early aerial travel 3
impossible. 3
3
But within an hour and a half interest again rose to banish disappointment. Lake, 3
sending more messages, told of the completely successful transportation of the 3
fourteen great specimens to the camp. It had been a hard pull, for the things were 3
surprisingly heavy; but nine men had accomplished it very neatly. Now some of 3
the party were hurriedly building a snow corral at a safe distance from the camp, 3
to which the dogs could be brought for greater convenience in feeding. The 3
specimens were laid out on the hard snow near the camp, save for one on which 3
Lake was making crude attempts at dissection. 3
3
This dissection seemed to be a greater task than had been expected, for, despite 3
the heat of a gasoline stove in the newly raised laboratory tent, the deceptively 3
flexible tissues of the chosen specimen - a powerful and intact one - lost nothing 3
of their more than leathery toughness. Lake was puzzled as to how he might 3
make the requisite incisions without violence destructive enough to upset all the 3
structural niceties he was looking for. He had, it is true, seven more perfect 3
specimens; but these were too few to use up recklessly unless the cave might 3
later yield an unlimited supply. Accordingly he removed the specimen and 3
dragged in one which, though having remnants of the starfish arrangements at 3
both ends, was badly crushed and partly disrupted along one of the great torso 3
furrows. 3
3
Results, quickly reported over the wireless, were baffling and provocative 3
indeed. Nothing like delicacy or accuracy was possible with instruments hardly 3
able to cut the anomalous tissue, but the little that was achieved left us all awed 3
and bewildered. Existing biology would have to be wholly revised, for this thing 3
was no product of any cell growth science knows about. There had been scarcely 3
any mineral replacement, and despite an age of perhaps forty million years, the 3
internal organs were wholly intact. The leathery, undeteriorative, and almost 3
3
3
3
25 3
3
3
3
indestructible quality was an inherent attribute of the thing's form of 3
organization, and pertained to some paleogean cycle of invertebrate evolution 3
utterly beyond our powers of speculation. At first all that Lake found was dry, 3
but as the heated tent produced its thawing effect, organic moisture of pungent 3
and offensive odor was encountered toward the thing's uninjured side. It was 3
not blood, but a thick, dark-green fluid apparently answering the same purpose. 3
By the time Lake reached this stage, all thirty-seven dogs had been brought to the 3
still uncompleted corral near the camp, and even at that distance set up a savage 3
barking and show of restlessness at the acrid, diffusive smell. 3
3
Far from helping to place the strange entity, this provisional dissection merely 3
deepened its mystery. All guesses about its external members had been correct, 3
and on the evidence of these one could hardly hesitate to call the thing animal; 3
but internal inspection brought up so many vegetable evidences that Lake was 3
left hopelessly at sea. It had digestion and circulation, and eliminated waste 3
matter through the reddish tubes of its starfish-shaped base. Cursorily, one 3
would say that its respiration apparatus handled oxygen rather than carbon 3
dioxide, and there were odd evidences of air-storage chambers and methods of 3
shifting respiration from the external orifice to at least two other fully developed 3
breathing systems - gills and pores. Clearly, it was amphibian, and probably 3
adapted to long airless hibernation periods as well. Vocal organs seemed present 3
in connection with the main respiratory system, but they presented anomalies 3
beyond immediate solution. Articulate speech, in the sense of syllable utterance, 3
seemed barely conceivable, but musical piping notes covering a wide range were 3
highly probable. The muscular system was almost prematurely developed. 3
3
The nervous system was so complex and highly developed as to leave Lake 3
aghast. Though excessively primitive and archaic in some respects, the thing had 3
a set of ganglial centers and connectives arguing the very extremes of specialized 3
development. Its five-lobed brain was surprisingly advanced, and there were 3
signs of a sensory equipment, served in part through the wiry cilia of the head, 3
involving factors alien to any other terrestrial organism. Probably it has more 3
than five senses, so that its habits could not be predicted from any existing 3
analogy. It must. Lake thought, have been a creature of keen sensitiveness and 3
delicately differentiated functions in its primal world - much like the ants and 3
bees of today. It reproduced like the vegetable cryptogams, especially the 3
Pteridophyta, having spore cases at the tips of the wings and evidently 3
developing from a thallus or prothallus. 3
3
But to give it a name at this stage was mere folly. It looked like a radiate, but was 3
clearly something more. It was partly vegetable, but had three-fourths of the 3
essentials of animal structure. That it was marine in origin, its symmetrical 3
contour and certain other attributes clearly indicated; yet one could not be exact 3
3
3
3
26 3
3
3
3
as to the limit of its later adaptations. The wings, after all, held a persistent 3
suggestion of the aerial. How it could have undergone its tremendously complex 3
evolution on a new-born earth in time to leave prints in Archaean rocks was so 3
far beyond conception as to make Lake whimsically recall the primal myths 3
about Great Old Ones who filtered down from the stars and concocted earth life 3
as a joke or mistake; and the wild tales of cosmic hill things from outside told by 3
a folklorist colleague in Miskatonic's English department. 3
3
Naturally, he considered the possibility of the pre-Cambrian prints having been 3
made by a less evolved ancestor of the present specimens, but quickly rejected 3
this too-facile theory upon considering the advanced structural qualities of the 3
older fossils. If anything, the later contours showed decadence rather than higher 3
evolution. The size of the pseudofeet had decreased, and the whole morphology 3
seemed coarsened and simplified. Moreover, the nerves and organs just 3
examined held singular suggestions of retrogression from forms still more 3
complex. Atrophied and vestigial parts were surprisingly prevalent. Altogether, 3
little could be said to have been solved; and Lake fell back on mythology for a 3
provisional name - jocosely dubbing his finds "The Elder Ones." 3
3
At about 2:30 A.M., having decided to postpone further work and get a little rest, 3
he covered the dissected organism with a tarpaulin, emerged from the laboratory 3
tent, and studied the intact specimens with renewed interest. The ceaseless 3
antarctic sun had begun to limber up their tissues a trifle, so that the head points 3
and tubes of two or three showed signs of unfolding; but Lake did not believe 3
there was any danger of immediate decomposition in the almost subzero air. He 3
did, however, move all the undissected specimens close together and throw a 3
spare tent over them in order to keep off the direct solar rays. That would also 3
help to keep their possible scent away from the dogs, whose hostile unrest was 3
really becoming a problem, even at their substantial distance and behind the 3
higher and higher snow walls which an increased quota of the men were 3
hastening to raise around their quarters. He had to weight down the corners of 3
the tent cloth with heavy blocks of snow to hold it in place amidst the rising gale, 3
for the titan mountains seemed about to deliver some gravely severe blasts. Early 3
apprehensions about sudden antarctic winds were revived, and under Atwood's 3
supervision precautions were taken to bank the tents, new dog corral, and crude 3
aeroplane shelters with snow on the mountainward side. These latter shelters, 3
begun with hard snow blocks during odd moments, were by no means as high as 3
they should have been; and Lake finally detached all hands from other tasks to 3
work on them. 3
3
It was after four when Lake at last prepared to sign off and advised us all to 3
share the rest period his outfit would take when the shelter walls were a little 3
higher. He held some friendly chat with Pabodie over the ether, and repeated his 3
3
3
3
27 3
3
3
3
praise of the really marvelous drills that had helped him make his discovery. 3
Atwood also sent greetings and praises. I gave Lake a warm word of 3
congratulations, owning up that he was right about the western trip, and we all 3
agreed to get in touch by wireless at ten in the morning. If the gale was then 3
over. Lake would send a plane for the party at my base. Just before retiring I 3
dispatched a final message to the Arkham with instructions about toning down 3
the day's news for the outside world, since the full details seemed radical enough 3
to rouse a wave of incredulity until further substantiated. 3
3
Ill 3
3
None of us, I imagine, slept very heavily or continuously that morning. Both the 3
excitement of Lake's discovery and the mounting fury of the wind were against 3
such a thing. So savage was the blast, even where we were, that we could not 3
help wondering how much worse it was at Lake's camp, directly under the vast 3
unknown peaks that bred and delivered it. McTighe was awake at ten o'clock 3
and tried to get Lake on the wireless, as agreed, but some electrical condition in 3
the disturbed air to the westward seemed to prevent communication. We did, 3
however, get the Arkham, and Douglas told me that he had likewise been vainly 3
trying to reach Lake. He had not known about the wind, for very little was 3
blowing at McMurdo Sound, despite its persistent rage where we were. 3
3
Throughout the day we all listened anxiously and tried to get Lake at intervals, 3
but invariably without results. About noon a positive frenzy of wind stampeded 3
out of the west, causing us to fear for the safety of our camp; but it eventually 3
died down, with only a moderate relapse at 2 P.M. After three o'clock it was very 3
quiet, and we redoubled our efforts to get Lake. Reflecting that he had four 3
planes, each provided with an excellent short-wave outfit, we could not imagine 3
any ordinary accident capable of crippling all his wireless equipment at once. 3
Nevertheless the stony silence continued, and when we thought of the delirious 3
force the wind must have had in his locality we could not help making the more 3
direful conjectures. 3
3
By six o'clock our fears had become intense and definite, and after a wireless 3
consultation with Douglas and Thorfinnssen I resolved to take steps toward 3
investigation. The fifth aeroplane, which we had left at the McMurdo Sound 3
supply cache with Sherman and two sailors, was in good shape and ready for 3
instant use, and it seemed that the very emergency for which it had been saved 3
was now upon us. I got Sherman by wireless and ordered him to join me with 3
the plane and the two sailors at the southern base as quickly as possible, the air 3
conditions being apparently highly favorable. We then talked over the personnel 3
of the coming investigation party, and decided that we would include all hands, 3
together with the sledge and dogs which I had kept with me. Even so great a 3
3
3
3
28 3
3
3
3
load would not be too much for one of the huge planes built to our special orders 3
for heavy machinery transportation. At intervals I still tried to reach Lake with 3
the wireless, but all to no purpose. 3
3
Sherman, with the sailors Gunnarsson and Larsen, took off at 7:30, and reported 3
a quiet flight from several points on the wing. They arrived at our base at 3
midnight, and all hands at once discussed the next move. It was risky business 3
sailing over the antarctic in a single aeroplane without any line of bases, but no 3
one drew back from what seemed like the plainest necessity. We turned in at two 3
o'clock for a brief rest after some preliminary loading of the plane, but were up 3
again in four hours to finish the loading and packing. 3
3
At 7:15 A.M., January 25th, we started flying northwestward under McTighe's 3
pilotage with ten men, seven dogs, a sledge, a fuel and food supply, and other 3
items including the plane's wireless outfit. The atmosphere was clear, fairly 3
quiet, and relatively mild in temperature, and we anticipated very little trouble 3
in reaching the latitude and longitude designated by Lake as the site of his camp. 3
Our apprehensions were over what we might find, or fail to find, at the end of 3
our journey, for silence continued to answer all calls dispatched to the camp. 3
3
Every incident of that four-and-a-half-hour flight is burned into my recollection 3
because of its crucial position in my life. It marked my loss, at the age of fifty- 3
four, of all that peace and balance which the normal mind possesses through its 3
accustomed conception of external nature and nature's laws. Thenceforward the 3
ten of us - but the student Danforth and myself above all others - were to face a 3
hideously amplified world of lurking horrors which nothing can erase from our 3
emotions, and which we would refrain from sharing with mankind in general if 3
we could. The newspapers have printed the bulletins we sent from the moving 3
plane, telling of our nonstop course, our two battles with treacherous upper-air 3
gales, our glimpse of the broken surface where Lake had sunk his mid-journey 3
shaft three days before, and our sight of a group of those strange fluffy snow 3
cylinders noted by Amundsen and Byrd as rolling in the wind across the endless 3
leagues of frozen plateau. There came a point, though, when our sensations 3
could not be conveyed in any words the press would understand, and a latter 3
point when we had to adopt an actual rule of strict censorship. 3
3
The sailor Larsen was first to spy the jagged line of witchlike cones and pinnacles 3
ahead, and his shouts sent everyone to the windows of the great cabined plane. 3
Despite our speed, they were very slow in gaining prominence; hence we knew 3
that they must be infinitely far off, and visible only because of their abnormal 3
height. Little by little, however, they rose grimly into the western sky; allowing 3
us to distinguish various bare, bleak, blackish summits, and to catch the curious 3
sense of fantasy which they inspired as seen in the reddish antarctic light against 3
3
3
3
29 3
3
3
3
the provocative background of iridescent ice-dust clouds. In the whole spectacle 3
there was a persistent, pervasive hint of stupendous secrecy and potential 3
revelation. It was as if these stark, nightmare spires marked the pylons of a 3
frightful gateway into forbidden spheres of dream, and complex gulfs of remote 3
time, space, and ultra-dimensionality. I could not help feeling that they were evil 3
things - mountains of madness whose farther slopes looked out over some 3
accursed ultimate abyss. That seething, half-luminous cloud background held 3
ineffable suggestions of a vague, ethereal beyondness far more than terrestrially 3
spatial, and gave appalling reminders of the utter remoteness, separateness, 3
desolation, and aeon-long death of this untrodden and unfathomed austral 3
world. 3
3
It was young Danforth who drew our notice to the curious regularities of the 3
higher mountain skyline - regularities like clinging fragments of perfect cubes, 3
which Lake had mentioned in his messages, and which indeed justified his 3
comparison with the dreamlike suggestions of primordial temple ruins, on 3
cloudy Asian mountaintops so subtly and strangely painted by Roerich. There 3
was indeed something hauntingly Roerich-like about this whole unearthly 3
continent of mountainous mystery. I had felt it in October when we first caught 3
sight of Victoria Land, and I felt it afresh now. I felt, too, another wave of uneasy 3
consciousness of Archaean mythical resemblances; of how disturbingly this 3
lethal realm corresponded to the evilly famed plateau of Leng in the primal 3
writings. Mythologists have placed Leng in Central Asia; but the racial memory 3
of man - or of his predecessors - is long, and it may well be that certain tales have 3
come down from lands and mountains and temples of horror earlier than Asia 3
and earlier than any human world we know. A few daring mystics have hinted 3
at a pre-Pleistocene origin for the fragmentary Pnakotic Manuscripts, and have 3
suggested that the devotees of Tsathoggua were as alien to mankind as 3
Tsathoggua itself. Leng, wherever in space or time it might brood, was not a 3
region I would care to be in or near, nor did I relish the proximity of a world that 3
had ever bred such ambiguous and Archaean monstrosities as those Lake had 3
just mentioned. At the moment I felt sorry that I had ever read the abhorred 3
Necronomicon, or talked so much with that unpleasantly erudite folklorist 3
Wilmarth at the university. 3
3
This mood undoubtedly served to aggravate my reaction to the bizarre mirage 3
which burst upon us from the increasingly opalescent zenith as we drew near the 3
mountains and began to make out the cumulative undulations of the foothills. I 3
had seen dozens of polar mirages during the preceding weeks, some of them 3
quite as uncanny and fantastically vivid as the present example; but this one had 3
a wholly novel and obscure quality of menacing symbolism, and I shuddered as 3
the seething labyrinth of fabulous walls and towers and minarets loomed out of 3
the troubled ice vapors above our heads. 3
3
3
3

3
3
3
The effect was that of a Cyclopean city of no architecture known to man or to 3
human imagination, with vast aggregations of night-black masonry embodying 3
monstrous perversions of geometrical laws. There were truncated cones, 3
sometimes terraced or fluted, surmounted by tall cylindrical shafts here and 3
there bulbously enlarged and often capped with tiers of thinnish scalloped disks; 3
and strange beetling, table-like constructions suggesting piles of multitudinous 3
rectangular slabs or circular plates or five-pointed stars with each one 3
overlapping the one beneath. There were composite cones and pyramids either 3
alone or surmounting cylinders or cubes or flatter truncated cones and pyramids, 3
and occasional needle-like spires in curious clusters of five. All of these febrile 3
structures seemed knit together by tubular bridges crossing from one to the other 3
at various dizzy heights, and the implied scale of the whole was terrifying and 3
oppressive in its sheer gigantism. The general type of mirage was not unlike 3
some of the wilder forms observed and drawn by the arctic whaler Scoresby in 3
1820, but at this time and place, with those dark, unknown mountain peaks 3
soaring stupendously ahead, that anomalous elder-world discovery in our 3
minds, and the pall of probable disaster enveloping the greater part of our 3
expedition, we all seemed to find in it a taint of latent malignity and infinitely 3
evil portent. 3
3
I was glad when the mirage began to break up, though in the process the various 3
nightmare turrets and cones assumed distorted, temporary forms of even vaster 3
hideousness. As the whole illusion dissolved to churning opalescence we began 3
to look earthward again, and saw that our journey's end was not far off. The 3
unknown mountains ahead rose dizzily up like a fearsome rampart of giants, 3
their curious regularities showing with startling clearness even without a field 3
glass. We were over the lowest foothills now, and could see amidst the snow, ice, 3
and bare patches of their main plateau a couple of darkish spots which we took 3
to be Lake's camp and boring. The higher foothills shot up between five and six 3
miles away, forming a range almost distinct from the terrifying line of more than 3
Himalayan peaks beyond them. At length Ropes - the student who had relieved 3
McTighe at the controls - began to head downward toward the left-hand dark 3
spot whose size marked it as the camp. As he did so, McTighe sent out the last 3
uncensored wireless message the world was to receive from our expedition. 3
3
Everyone, of course, has read the brief and unsatisfying bulletins of the rest of 3
our antarctic sojourn. Some hours after our landing we sent a guarded report of 3
the tragedy we found, and reluctantly announced the wiping out of the whole 3
Lake party by the frightful wind of the preceding day, or of the night before that. 3
Eleven known dead, young Gedney missing. People pardoned our hazy lack of 3
details through realization of the shock the sad event must have caused us, and 3
believed us when we explained that the mangling action of the wind had 3
rendered all eleven bodies unsuitable for transportation outside. Indeed, I flatter 3
3
3
3
31 3
3
3
3
myself that even in the midst of our distress, utter bewilderment, and soul- 3
clutching horror, we scarcely went beyond the truth in any specific instance. The 3
tremendous significance lies in what we dared not tell; what I would not tell now 3
but for the need of warning others off from nameless terrors. 3
3
It is a fact that the wind had brought dreadful havoc. Whether all could have 3
lived through it, even without the other thing, is gravely open to doubt. The 3
storm, with its fury of madly driven ice particles, must have been beyond 3
anything our expedition had encountered before. One aeroplane shelter-wall, it 3
seems, had been left in a far too flimsy and inadequate state - was nearly 3
pulverized - and the derrick at the distant boring was entirely shaken to pieces. 3
The exposed metal of the grounded planes and drilling machinery was bruised 3
into a high polish, and two of the small tents were flattened despite their snow 3
banking. Wooden surfaces left out in the blaster were pitted and denuded of 3
paint, and all signs of tracks in the snow were completely obliterated. It is also 3
true that we found none of the Archaean biological objects in a condition to take 3
outside as a whole. We did gather some minerals from a vast, tumbled pile, 3
including several of the greenish soapstone fragments whose odd five-pointed 3
rounding and faint patterns of grouped dots caused so many doubtful 3
comparisons; and some fossil bones, among which were the most typical of the 3
curiously injured specimens. 3
3
None of the dogs survived, their hurriedly built snow inclosure near the camp 3
being almost wholly destroyed. The wind may have done that, though the 3
greater breakage on the side next the camp, which was not the windward one, 3
suggests an outward leap or break of the frantic beasts themselves. All three 3
sledges were gone, and we have tried to explain that the wind may have blown 3
them off into the unknown. The drill and ice-melting machinery at the boring 3
were too badly damaged to warrant salvage, so we used them to choke up that 3
subtly disturbing gateway to the past which Lake had blasted. We likewise left at 3
the camp the two most shaken up of the planes; since our surviving party had 3
only four real pilots - Sherman, Danforth, McTighe, and Ropes - in all, with 3
Danforth in a poor nervous shape to navigate. We brought back all the books, 3
scientific equipment, and other incidentals we could find, though much was 3
rather unaccountably blown away. Spare tents and furs were either missing or 3
badly out of condition. 3
3
It was approximately 4 P.M., after wide plane cruising had forced us to give 3
Gedney up for lost, that we sent our guarded message to the Arkham for 3
relaying; and I think we did well to keep it as calm and noncommittal as we 3
succeeded in doing. The most we said about agitation concerned our dogs, 3
whose frantic uneasiness near the biological specimens was to be expected from 3
poor Lake's accounts. We did not mention, I think, their display of the same 3
3
3
3
32 3
3
3
3
uneasiness when sniffing around the queer greenish soapstones and certain other 3
objects in the disordered region-objects including scientific instruments, 3
aeroplanes, and machinery, both at the camp and at the boring, whose parts had 3
been loosened, moved, or otherwise tampered with by winds that must have 3
harbored singular curiosity and investigativeness. 3
3
About the fourteen biological specimens, we were pardonably indefinite. We 3
said that the only ones we discovered were damaged, but that enough was left of 3
them to prove Lake's description wholly and impressively accurate. It was hard 3
work keeping our personal emotions out of this matter - and we did not mention 3
numbers or say exactly how we had found those which we did find. We had by 3
that time agreed not to transmit anything suggesting madness on the part of 3
Lake's men, and it surely looked like madness to find six imperfect monstrosities 3
carefully buried upright in nine-foot snow graves under five-pointed mounds 3
punched over with groups of dots in patterns exactly those on the queer greenish 3
soapstones dug up from Mesozoic or Tertiary times. The eight perfect specimens 3
mentioned by Lake seemed to have been completely blown away. 3
3
We were careful, too, about the public's general peace of mind; hence Danforth 3
and I said little about that frightful trip over the mountains the next day. It was 3
the fact that only a radically lightened plane could possibly cross a range of such 3
height, which mercifully limited that scouting tour to the two of us. On our 3
return at one A.M., Danforth was close to hysterics, but kept an admirably stiff 3
upper lip. It took no persuasion to make him promise not to show our sketches 3
and the other things we brought away in our pockets, not to say anything more 3
to the others than what we had agreed to relay outside, and to hide our camera 3
films for private development later on; so that part of my present story will be as 3
new to Pabodie, McTighe, Ropes, Sherman, and the rest as it will be to the world 3
in general. Indeed, Danforth is closer mouthed than I: for he saw, or thinks he 3
saw, one thing he will not tell even me. 3
3
As all know, our report included a tale of a hard ascent - a confirmation of Lake's 3
opinion that the great peaks are of Archaean slate and other very primal 3
crumpled strata unchanged since at least middle Comanchian times; a 3
conventional comment on the regularity of the clinging cube and rampart 3
formations; a decision that the cave mouths indicate dissolved calcaerous veins; a 3
conjecture that certain slopes and passes would permit of the scaling and 3
crossing of the entire range by seasoned mountaineers; and a remark that the 3
mysterious other side holds a lofty and immense superplateau as ancient and 3
unchanging as the mountains themselves - twenty thousand feet in elevation, 3
with grotesque rock formations protruding through a thin glacial layer and with 3
low gradual foothills between the general plateau surface and the sheer 3
precipices of the highest peaks. 3
3
3
3
33 3
3
3
3
This body of data is in every respect true so far as it goes, and it completely 3
satisfied the men at the camp. We laid our absence of sixteen hours - a longer 3
time than our announced flying, landing, reconnoitering, and rock-collecting 3
program called for - to a long mythical spell of adverse wind conditions, and told 3
truly of our landing on the farther foothills. Fortunately our tale sounded 3
realistic and prosaic enough not to tempt any of the others into emulating our 3
flight. Had any tried to do that, I would have used every ounce of my persuasion 3
to stop them - and I do not know what Danforth would have done. While we 3
were gone, Pabodie, Sherman, Ropes, McTighe, and Williamson had worked like 3
beavers over Lake's two best planes, fitting them again for use despite the 3
altogether unaccountable juggling of their operative mechanism. 3
3
We decided to load all the planes the next morning and start back for our old 3
base as soon as possible. Even though indirect, that was the safest way to work 3
toward McMurdo Sound; for a straightline flight across the most utterly 3
unknown stretches of the aeon-dead continent would involve many additional 3
hazards. Further exploration was hardly feasible in view of our tragic decimation 3
and the ruin of our drilling machinery. The doubts and horrors around us - 3
which we did not reveal - made us wish only to escape from this austral world of 3
desolation and brooding madness as swiftly as we could. 3
3
As the public knows, our return to the world was accomplished without further 3
disasters. All planes reached the old base on the evening of the next day - 3
January 27th - after a swift nonstop flight; and on the 28th we made McMurdo 3
Sound in two laps, the one pause being very brief, and occasioned by a faulty 3
rudder in the furious wind over the ice shelf after we had cleared the great 3
plateau. In five days more, the Arkham and Miskatonic, with all hands and 3
equipment on board, were shaking clear of the thickening field ice and working 3
up Ross Sea with the mocking mountains of Victoria Land looming westward 3
against a troubled antarctic sky and twisting the wind's wails into a wide-ranged 3
musical piping which chilled my soul to the quick. Less than a fortnight later we 3
left the last hint of polar land behind us and thanked heaven that we were clear 3
of a haunted, accursed realm where life and death, space and time, have made 3
black and blasphemous alliances, in the unknown epochs since matter first 3
writhed and swam on the planet's scarce-cooled crust. 3
3
Since our return we have all constantly worked to discourage antarctic 3
exploration, and have kept certain doubts and guesses to ourselves with 3
splendid unity and faithfulness. Even young Danforth, with his nervous 3
breakdown, has not flinched or babbled to his doctors - indeed, as I have said, 3
there is one thing he thinks he alone saw which he will not tell even me, though I 3
think it would help his psychological state if he would consent to do so. It might 3
explain and relieve much, though perhaps the thing was no more than the 3
3
3
3
34 3
3
3
3
delusive aftermath of an earlier shock. That is the impression I gather after those 3
rare, irresponsible moments when he whispers disjointed things to me - things 3
which he repudiates vehemently as soon as he gets a grip on himself again. 3
3
It will be hard work deterring others from the great white south, and some of our 3
efforts may directly harm our cause by drawing inquiring notice. We might have 3
known from the first that human curiosity is undying, and that the results we 3
announced would be enough to spur others ahead on the same age-long pursuit 3
of the unknown. Lake's reports of those biological monstrosities had aroused 3
naturalists and paleontologists to the highest pitch, though we were sensible 3
enough not to show the detached parts we had taken from the actual buried 3
specimens, or our photographs of those specimens as they were found. We also 3
refrained from showing the more puzzling of the scarred bones and greenish 3
soapstones; while Danforth and I have closely guarded the pictures we took or 3
drew on the superplateau across the range, and the crumpled things we 3
smoothed, studied in terror, and brought away in our pockets. 3
3
But now that Starkweather-Moore party is organizing, and with a thoroughness 3
far beyond anything our outfit attempted. If not dissuaded, they will get to the 3
innermost nucleus of the antarctic and melt and bore till they bring up that 3
which we know may end the world. So I must break through all reticences at last 3
- even about that ultimate, nameless thing beyond the mountains of madness. 3
3
IV 3
3
It is only with vast hesitancy and repugnance that I let my mind go back to 3
Lake's camp and what we really found there - and to that other thing beyond the 3
mountains of madness. I am constantly tempted to shirk the details, and to let 3
hints stand for actual facts and ineluctable deductions. I hope I have said enough 3
already to let me glide briefly over the rest; the rest, that is, of the horror at the 3
camp. I have told of the wind-ravaged terrain, the damaged shelters, the 3
disarranged machinery, the varied uneasiness of our dogs, the missing sledges 3
and other items, the deaths of men and dogs, the absence of Gedney, and the six 3
insanely buried biological specimens, strangely sound in texture for all their 3
structural injuries, from a world forty million years dead. I do not recall whether 3
I mentioned that upon checking up the canine bodies we found one dog missing. 3
We did not think much about that till later - indeed, only Danforth and I have 3
thought of it at all. 3
3
The principal things I have been keeping back relate to the bodies, and to certain 3
subtle points which may or may not lend a hideous and incredible kind of 3
rationale to the apparent chaos. At the time, I tried to keep the men's minds off 3
those points; for it was so much simpler - so much more normal - to lay 3
3
3
3
35 3
3
3
3
everything to an outbreak of madness on the part of some of Lake's party. From 3
the look of things, that demon mountain wind must have been enough to drive 3
any man mad in the midst of this center of all earthly mystery and desolation. 3
3
The crowning abnormality, of course, was the condition of the bodies - men and 3
dogs alike. They had all been in some terrible kind of conflict, and were torn and 3
mangled in fiendish and altogether inexplicable ways. Death, so far as we could 3
judge, had in each case come from strangulation or laceration. The dogs had 3
evidently started the trouble, for the state of their ill-built corral bore witness to 3
its forcible breakage from within. It had been set some distance from the camp 3
because of the hatred of the animals for those hellish Archaean organisms, but 3
the precaution seemed to have been taken in vain. When left alone in that 3
monstrous wind, behind flimsy walls of insufficient height, they must have 3
stampeded - whether from the wind itself, or from some subtle, increasing odor 3
emitted by the nightmare specimens, one could not say. 3
3
But whatever had happened, it was hideous and revolting enough. Perhaps I had 3
better put squeamishness aside and tell the worst at last - though with a 3
categorical statement of opinion, based on the first-hand observations and most 3
rigid deductions of both Danforth and myself, that the then missing Gedney was 3
in no way responsible for the loathsome horrors we found. I have said that the 3
bodies were frightfully mangled. Now I must add that some were incised and 3
subtracted from in the most curious, cold-blooded, and inhuman fashion. It was 3
the same with dogs and men. All the healthier, fatter bodies, quadrupedal or 3
bipedal, had had their most solid masses of tissue cut out and removed, as by a 3
careful butcher; and around them was a strange sprinkling of salt - taken from 3
the ravaged provision chests on the planes - which conjured up the most horrible 3
associations. The thing had occurred in one of the crude aeroplane shelters from 3
which the plane had been dragged out, and subsequent winds had effaced all 3
tracks which could have supplied any plausible theory. Scattered bits of clothing, 3
roughly slashed from the human incision subjects, hinted no clues. It is useless to 3
bring up the half impression of certain faint snow prints in one shielded corner of 3
the ruined inclosure - because that impression did not concern human prints at 3
all, but was clearly mixed up with all the talk of fossil prints which poor Lake 3
had been giving throughout the preceding weeks. One had to be careful of one's 3
imagination in the lee of those overshadowing mountains of madness. 3
3
As I have indicated, Gedney and one dog turned out to be missing in the end. 3
When we came on that terrible shelter we had missed two dogs and two men; 3
but the fairly unharmed dissecting tent, which we entered after investigating the 3
monstrous graves, had something to reveal. It was not as Lake had left it, for the 3
covered parts of the primal monstrosity had been removed from the improvised 3
table. Indeed, we had already realized that one of the six imperfect and insanely 3
3
3
3
36 3
3
3
3
buried things we had found - the one with the trace of a pecuharly hateful odor - 3
must represent the collected sections of the entity which Lake had tried to 3
analyze. On and around that laboratory table were strewn other things, and it 3
did not take long for us to guess that those things were the carefully though 3
oddly and inexpertly dissected parts of one man and one dog. I shall spare the 3
feelings of survivors by omitting mention of the man's identity. Lake's 3
anatomical instruments were missing, but there were evidences of their careful 3
cleansing. The gasoline stove was also gone, though around it we found a 3
curious litter of matches. We buried the human parts beside the other ten men; 3
and the canine parts with the other thirty-five dogs. Concerning the bizarre 3
smudges on the laboratory table, and on the jumble of roughly handled 3
illustrated books scattered near it, we were much too bewildered to speculate. 3
3
This formed the worst of the camp horror, but other things were equally 3
perplexing. The disappearance of Gedney, the one dog, the eight uninjured 3
biological specimens, the three sledges, and certain instruments, illustrated 3
technical and scientific books, writing materials, electric torches and batteries, 3
food and fuel, heating apparatus, spare tents, fur suits, and the like, was utterly 3
beyond sane conjecture; as were likewise the spatter-fringed ink blots on certain 3
pieces of paper, and the evidences of curious alien fumbling and experimentation 3
around the planes and all other mechanical devices both at the camp and at the 3
boring. 3
3
The dogs seemed to abhor this oddly disordered machinery. Then, too, there was 3
the upsetting of the larder, the disappearance of certain staples, and the jarringly 3
comical heap of tin cans pried open in the most unlikely ways and at the most 3
unlikely places. The profusion of scattered matches, intact, broken, or spent, 3
formed another minor enigma - as did the two or three tent cloths and fur suits 3
which we found lying about with peculiar and unorthodox slashings conceivably 3
due to clumsy efforts at unimaginable adaptations. The maltreatment of the 3
human and canine bodies, and the crazy burial of the damaged Archaean 3
specimens, were all of a piece with this apparent disintegrative madness. In view 3
of just such an eventuality as the present one, we carefully photographed all the 3
main evidences of insane disorder at the camp; and shall use the prints to 3
buttress our pleas against the departure of the proposed Starkweather- Moore 3
Expedition. 3
3
Our first act after finding the bodies in the shelter was to photograph and open 3
the row of insane graves with the five-pointed snow mounds. We could not help 3
noticing the resemblance of these monstrous mounds, with their clusters of 3
grouped dots, to poor Lake's descriptions of the strange greenish soapstones; 3
and when we came on some of the soapstones themselves in the great mineral 3
pile, we found the likeness very close indeed. The whole general formation, it 3
3
3
3
37 3
3
3
3
must be made clear, seemed abominably suggestive of the starfish head of the 3
Archaean entities; and we agreed that the suggestion must have worked potently 3
upon the sensitized minds of Lake's overwrought party. 3
3
For madness - centering in Gedney as the only possible surviving agent - was the 3
explanation spontaneously adopted by everybody so far as spoken utterance was 3
concerned; though I will not be so naive as to deny that each of us may have 3
harbored wild guesses which sanity forbade him to formulate completely. 3
Sherman, Pabodie, and McTighe made an exhaustive aeroplane cruise over all 3
the surrounding territory in the afternoon, sweeping the horizon with field 3
glasses in quest of Gedney and of the various missing things; but nothing came 3
to light. The party reported that the titan barrier range extended endlessly to 3
right and left alike, without any diminution in height or essential structure. On 3
some of the peaks, though, the regular cube and rampart formations were bolder 3
and plainer, having doubly fantastic similitudes to Roerich-painted Asian hill 3
ruins. The distribution of cryptical cave mouths on the black snow-denuded 3
summits seemed roughly even as far as the range could be traced. 3
3
In spite of all the prevailing horrors, we were left with enough sheer scientific 3
zeal and adventurousness to wonder about the unknown realm beyond those 3
mysterious mountains. As our guarded messages stated, we rested at midnight 3
after our day of terror and bafflement - but not without a tentative plan for one 3
or more range-crossing altitude flights in a lightened plane with aerial camera 3
and geologist's outfit, beginning the following morning. It was decided that 3
Danforth and I try it first, and we awaked at 7 A.M. intending an early flight; 3
however, heavy winds - mentioned in our brief, bulletin to the outside world - 3
delayed our start till nearly nine o'clock. 3
3
I have already repeated the noncommittal story we told the men at camp - and 3
relayed outside - after our return sixteen hours later. It is now my terrible duty to 3
amplify this account by filling in the merciful blanks with hints of what we really 3
saw in the hidden transmontane world - hints of the revelations which have 3
finally driven Danforth to a nervous collapse. I wish he would add a really frank 3
word about the thing which he thinks he alone saw - even though it was 3
probably a nervous delusion - and which was perhaps the last straw that put him 3
where he is; but he is firm against that. All I can do is to repeat his later 3
disjointed whispers about what set him shrieking as the plane soared back 3
through the wind-tortured mountain pass after that real and tangible shock 3
which I shared. This will form my last word. If the plain signs of surviving elder 3
horrors in what I disclose be not enough to keep others from meddling with the 3
inner antarctic - or at least from prying too deeply beneath the surface of that 3
ultimate waste of forbidden secrets and inhuman, aeon-cursed desolation - the 3
responsibility for unnamable and perhaps immeasurable evils will not be mine. 3
3
3
3
38 3
3
3
3
Danforth and I, studying the notes made by Pabodie in his afternoon flight and 3
checking up with a sextant, had calculated that the lowest available pass in the 3
range lay somewhat to the right of us, within sight of camp, and about twenty- 3
three thousand or twenty-four thousand feet above sea level. For this point, then, 3
we first headed in the lightened plane as we embarked on our flight of discovery. 3
The camp itself, on foothills which sprang from a high continental plateau, was 3
some twelve thousand feet in altitude; hence the actual height increase necessary 3
was not so vast as it might seem. Nevertheless we were acutely conscious of the 3
rarefied air and intense cold as we rose; for, on account of visibility conditions, 3
we had to leave the cabin windows open. We were dressed, of course, in our 3
heaviest furs. 3
3
As we drew near the forbidding peaks, dark and sinister above the line of 3
crevasse-riven snow and interstitial glaciers, we noticed more and more the 3
curiously regular formations clinging to the slopes; and thought again of the 3
strange Asian paintings of Nicholas Roerich. The ancient and wind-weathered 3
rock strata fully verified all of Lake's bulletins, and proved that these pinnacles 3
had been towering up in exactly the same way since a surprisingly early time in 3
earth's history - perhaps over fifty million years. How much higher they had 3
once been, it was futile to guess; but everything about this strange region pointed 3
to obscure atmospheric influences unfavorable to change, and calculated to 3
retard the usual climatic processes of rock disintegration. 3
3
But it was the mountainside tangle of regular cubes, ramparts, and cave mouths 3
which fascinated and disturbed us most. I studied them with a field glass and 3
took aerial photographs while Danforth drove; and at times I relieved him at the 3
controls - though my aviation knowledge was purely an amateur's - in order to 3
let him use the binoculars. We could easily see that much of the material of the 3
things was a lightish Archaean quartzite, unlike any formation visible over broad 3
areas of the general surface; and that their regularity was extreme and uncanny 3
to an extent which poor Lake had scarcely hinted. 3
3
As he had said, their edges were crumbled and rounded from untold aeons of 3
savage weathering; but their preternatural solidity and tough material had saved 3
them from obliteration. Many parts, especially those closest to the slopes, seemed 3
identical in substance with the surrounding rock surface. The whole arrangement 3
looked like the ruins of Macchu Picchu in the Andes, or the primal foundation 3
walls of Kish as dug up by the Oxford Field Museum Expedition in 1929; and 3
both Danforth and I obtained that occasional impression of separate Cyclopean 3
blocks which Lake had attributed to his flight-companion Carroll. How to 3
account for such things in this place was frankly beyond me, and I felt queerly 3
humbled as a geologist. Igneous formations often have strange regularities - like 3
the famous Giants' Causeway in Ireland - but this stupendous range, despite 3
3
3
3
39 3
3
3
3
Lake's original suspicion of smoking cones, was above all else nonvolcanic in 3
evident structure. 3
3
The curious cave mouths, near which the odd formations seemed most 3
abundant, presented another albeit a lesser puzzle because of their regularity of 3
outline. They were, as Lake's bulletin had said, often approximately square or 3
semicircular; as if the natural orifices had been shaped to greater symmetry by 3
some magic hand. Their numerousness and wide distribution were remarkable, 3
and suggested that the whole region was honeycombed with tunnels dissolved 3
out of limestone strata. Such glimpses as we secured did not extend far within 3
the caverns, but we saw that they were apparently clear of stalactites and 3
stalagmites. Outside, those parts of the mountain slopes adjoining the apertures 3
seemed invariably smooth and regular; and Danforth thought that the slight 3
cracks and pittings of the weathering tended toward unusual patterns. Filled as 3
he was with the horrors and strangenesses discovered at the camp, he hinted that 3
the pittings vaguely resembled those baffling groups of dots sprinkled over the 3
primeval greenish soapstones, so hideously duplicated on the madly conceived 3
snow mounds above those six buried monstrosities. 3
3
We had risen gradually in flying over the higher foothills and along toward the 3
relatively low pass we had selected. As we advanced we occasionally looked 3
down at the snow and ice of the land route, wondering whether we could have 3
attempted the trip with the simpler equipment of earlier days. Somewhat to our 3
surprise we saw that the terrain was far from difficult as such things go; and that 3
despite the crevasses and other bad spots it would not have been likely to deter 3
the sledges of a Scott, a Shackleton, or an Amundsen. Some of the glaciers 3
appeared to lead up to wind-bared passes with unusual continuity, and upon 3
reaching our chosen pass we found that its case formed no exception. 3
3
Our sensations of tense expectancy as we prepared to round the crest and peer 3
out over an untrodden world can hardly be described on paper; even though we 3
had no cause to think the regions beyond the range essentially different from 3
those already seen and traversed. The touch of evil mystery in these barrier 3
mountains, and in the beckoning sea of opalescent sky glimpsed betwixt their 3
summits, was a highly subtle and attenuated matter not to be explained in literal 3
words. Rather was it an affair of vague psychological symbolism and aesthetic 3
association - a thing mixed up with exotic poetry and paintings, and with archaic 3
myths lurking in shunned and forbidden volumes. Even the wind's burden held 3
a peculiar strain of conscious malignity; and for a second it seemed that the 3
composite sound included a bizarre musical whistling or piping over a wide 3
range as the blast swept in and out of the omnipresent and resonant cave 3
mouths. There was a cloudy note of reminiscent repulsion in this sound, as 3
complex and unplaceable as any of the other dark impressions. 3
3
3
3
40 3
3
3
3
We were now, after a slow ascent, at a height of twenty-three thousand, five 3
hundred and seventy feet according to the aneroid; and had left the region of 3
clinging snow definitely below us. Up here were only dark, bare rock slopes and 3
the start of rough-ribbed glaciers - but with those provocative cubes, ramparts, 3
and echoing cave mouths to add a portent of the unnatural, the fantastic, and the 3
dreamlike. Looking along the line of high peaks, I thought I could see the one 3
mentioned by poor Lake, with a rampart exactly on top. It seemed to be half lost 3
in a queer antarctic haze - such a haze, perhaps, as had been responsible for 3
Lake's early notion of volcanism. The pass loomed directly before us, smooth 3
and windswept between its jagged and malignly frowning pylons. Beyond it was 3
a sky fretted with swirling vapors and lighted by the low polar sun - the sky of 3
that mysterious farther realm upon which we felt no human eye had ever gazed. 3
3
A few more feet of altitude and we would behold that realm. Danforth and I, 3
unable to speak except in shouts amidst the howling, piping wind that raced 3
through the pass and added to the noise of the unmuffled engines, exchanged 3
eloquent glances. And then, having gained those last few feet, we did indeed 3
stare across the momentous divide and over the unsampled secrets of an elder 3
and utterly alien earth. 3
3
V 3
3
I think that both of us simultaneously cried out in mixed awe, wonder, terror, 3
and disbelief in our own senses as we finally cleared the pass and saw what lay 3
beyond. Of course, we must have had some natural theory in the back of our 3
heads to steady our faculties for the moment. Probably we thought of such things 3
as the grotesquely weathered stones of the Garden of the Gods in Colorado, or 3
the fantastically symmetrical wind-carved rocks of the Arizona desert. Perhaps 3
we even half thought the sight a mirage like that we had seen the morning before 3
on first approaching those mountains of madness. We must have had some such 3
normal notions to fall back upon as our eyes swept that limitless, tempest- 3
scarred plateau and grasped the almost endless labyrinth of colossal, regular, 3
and geometrically eurythmic stone masses which reared their crumbled and 3
pitted crests above a glacial sheet not more than forty or fifty feet deep at its 3
thickest, and in places obviously thinner. 3
3
The effect of the monstrous sight was indescribable, for some fiendish violation 3
of known natural law seemed certain at the outset. Here, on a hellishly ancient 3
table-land fully twenty thousand feet high, and in a climate deadly to habitation 3
since a prehuman age not less than five hundred thousand years ago, there 3
stretched nearly to the vision's limit a tangle of orderly stone which only the 3
desperation of mental self- defense could possibly attribute to any but conscious 3
and artificial cause. We had previously dismissed, so far as serious thought was 3
3
3
3
41 3
3
3
3
concerned, any theory that the cubes and ramparts of the mountainsides were 3
other than natural in origin. How could they be otherwise, when man himself 3
could scarcely have been differentiated from the great apes at the time when this 3
region succumbed to the present unbroken reign of glacial death? 3
3
Yet now the sway of reason seemed irrefutably shaken, for this Cyclopean maze 3
of squared, curved, and angled blocks had features which cut off all comfortable 3
refuge. It was, very clearly, the blasphemous city of the mirage in stark, objective, 3
and ineluctable reality. That damnable portent had had a material basis after all - 3
there had been some horizontal stratum of ice dust in the upper air, and this 3
shocking stone survival had projected its image across the mountains according 3
to the simple laws of reflection. Of course, the phantom had been twisted and 3
exaggerated, and had contained things which the real source did not contain; yet 3
now, as we saw that real source, we thought it even more hideous and menacing 3
than its distant image. 3
3
Only the incredible, unhuman massiveness of these vast stone towers and 3
ramparts had saved the frightful things from utter annihilation in the hundreds 3
of thousands - perhaps millions - of years it had brooded there amidst the blasts 3
of a bleak upland. "Corona Mundi - Roof of the World - " All sorts of fantastic 3
phrases sprang to our lips as we looked dizzily down at the unbelievable 3
spectacle. I thought again of the eldritch primal myths that had so persistently 3
haunted me since my first sight of this dead antarctic world - of the demoniac 3
plateau of Leng, of the Mi-Go, or abominable Snow Men of the Himalayas, of the 3
Pnakotic Manuscripts with their prehuman implications, of the Cthulhu cult, of 3
the Necronomicon, and of the Hyperborean legends of formless Tsathoggua and 3
the worse than formless star spawn associated with that semientity. 3
3
For boundless miles in every direction the thing stretched off with very little 3
thinning; indeed, as our eyes followed it to the right and left along the base of the 3
low, gradual foothills which separated it from the actual mountain rim, we 3
decided that we could see no thinning at all except for an interruption at the left 3
of the pass through which we had come. We had merely struck, at random, a 3
limited part of something of incalculable extent. The foothills were more sparsely 3
sprinkled with grotesque stone structures, linking the terrible city to the already 3
familiar cubes and ramparts which evidently formed its mountain outposts. 3
These latter, as well as the queer cave mouths, were as thick on the inner as on 3
the outer sides of the mountains. 3
3
The nameless stone labyrinth consisted, for the most part, of walls from ten to 3
one hundred and fifty feet in ice-clear height, and of a thickness varying from 3
five to ten feet. It was composed mostly of prodigious blocks of dark primordial 3
slate, schist, and sandstone - blocks in many cases as large as 4 x 6 x 8 feet - 3
3
3
3
42 3
3
3
3
though in several places it seemed to be carved out of a solid, uneven bed rock of 3
pre-Cambrian slate. The buildings were far from equal in size, there being 3
innumerable honeycomb arrangements of enormous extent as well as smaller 3
separate structures. The general shape of these things tended to be conical, 3
pyramidal, or terraced; though there were many perfect cylinders, perfect cubes, 3
clusters of cubes, and other rectangular forms, and a peculiar sprinkling of 3
angled edifices whose five-pointed ground plan roughly suggested modern 3
fortifications. The builders had made constant and expert use of the principle of 3
the arch, and domes had probably existed in the city's heyday. 3
3
The whole tangle was monstrously weathered, and the glacial surface from 3
which the towers projected was strewn with fallen blocks and immemorial 3
debris. Where the glaciation was transparent we could see the lower parts of the 3
gigantic piles, and we noticed the ice-preserved stone bridges which connected 3
the different towers at varying distances above the ground. On the exposed walls 3
we could detect the scarred places where other and higher bridges of the same 3
sort had existed. Closer inspection revealed countless largish windows; some of 3
which were closed with shutters of a petrified material originally wood, though 3
most gaped open in a sinister and menacing fashion. Many of the ruins, of 3
course, were roofless, and with uneven though wind-rounded upper edges; 3
whilst others, of a more sharply conical or pyramidal model or else protected by 3
higher surrounding structures, preserved intact outlines despite the omnipresent 3
crumbling and pitting. With the field glass we could barely make out what 3
seemed to be sculptural decorations in horizontal bands - decorations including 3
those curious groups of dots whose presence on the ancient soapstones now 3
assumed a vastly larger significance. 3
3
In many places the buildings were totally ruined and the ice sheet deeply riven 3
from various geologic causes. In other places the stonework was worn down to 3
the very level of the glaciation. One broad swath, extending from the plateau's 3
interior, to a cleft in the foothills about a mile to the left of the pass we had 3
traversed, was wholly free from buildings. It probably represented, we 3
concluded, the course of some great river which in Tertiary times - millions of 3
years ago - had poured through the city and into some prodigious subterranean 3
abyss of the great barrier range. Certainly, this was above all a region of caves, 3
gulfs, and underground secrets beyond human penetration. 3
3
Looking back to our sensations, and recalling our dazedness at viewing this 3
monstrous survival from aeons we had thought prehuman, I can only wonder 3
that we preserved the semblance of equilibrium, which we did. Of course, we 3
knew that something - chronology, scientific theory, or our own consciousness - 3
was woefully awry; yet we kept enough poise to guide the plane, observe many 3
things quite minutely, and take a careful series of photographs which may yet 3
3
3
3
43 3
3
3
3
serve both us and the world in good stead. In my case, ingrained scientific habit 3
may have helped; for above all my bewilderment and sense of menace, there 3
burned a dominant curiosity to fathom more of this age-old secret - to know 3
what sort of beings had built and lived in this incalculably gigantic place, and 3
what relation to the general world of its time or of other times so unique a 3
concentration of life could have had. 3
3
For this place could be no ordinary city. It must have formed the primary 3
nucleus and center of some archaic and unbelievable chapter of earth's history 3
whose outward ramifications, recalled only dimly in the most obscure and 3
distorted myths, had vanished utterly amidst the chaos of terrene convulsions 3
long before any human race we know had shambled out of apedom. Here 3
sprawled a Palaeogaean megalopolis compared with which the fabled Atlantis 3
and Lemuria, Commoriom and Uzuldaroum, and Olathoc in the land of Lomar, 3
are recent things of today - not even of yesterday; a megalopolis ranking with 3
such whispered prehuman blasphemies as Valusia, R'lyeh, lb in the land of 3
Mnar, and the Nameless city of Arabia Deserta. As we flew above that tangle of 3
stark titan towers my imagination sometimes escaped all bounds and roved 3
aimlessly in realms of fantastic associations - even weaving links betwixt this lost 3
world and some of my own wildest dreams concerning the mad horror at the 3
camp. 3
3
The plane's fuel tank, in the interest of greater lightness, had been only partly 3
filled; hence we now had to exert caution in our explorations. Even so, however, 3
we covered an enormous extent of ground - or, rather, air - after swooping down 3
to a level where the wind became virtually negligible. There seemed to be no 3
limit to the mountain range, or to the length of the frightful stone city which 3
bordered its inner foothills. Fifty miles of flight in each direction showed no 3
major change in the labyrinth of rock and masonry that clawed up corpselike 3
through the eternal ice. There were, though, some highly absorbing 3
diversifications; such as the carvings on the canyon where that broad river had 3
once pierced the foothills and approached its sinking place in the great range. 3
The headlands at the stream's entrance had been boldly carved into Cyclopean 3
pylons; and something about the ridgy, barrel-shaped designs stirred up oddly 3
vague, hateful, and confusing semi-remembrances in both Danforth and me. 3
3
We also came upon several star-shaped open spaces, evidently public squares, 3
and noted various undulations in the terrain. Where a sharp hill rose, it was 3
generally hollowed out into some sort of rambling-stone edifice; but there were 3
at least two exceptions. Of these latter, one was too badly weathered to disclose 3
what had been on the jutting eminence, while the other still bore a fantastic 3
conical monument carved out of the solid rock and roughly resembling such 3
things as the well-known Snake Tomb in the ancient valley of Petra. 3
3
3
3
44 3
3
3
3
Flying inland from the mountains, we discovered that the city was not of infinite 3
width, even though its length along the foothills seemed endless. After about 3
thirty miles the grotesque stone buildings began to thin out, and in ten more 3
miles we came to an unbroken waste virtually without signs of sentient artifice. 3
The course of the river beyond the city seemed marked by a broad, depressed 3
line, while the land assumed a somewhat greater ruggedness, seeming to slope 3
slightly upward as it receded in the mist-hazed west. 3
3
So far we had made no landing, yet to leave the plateau without an attempt at 3
entering some of the monstrous structures would have been inconceivable. 3
Accordingly, we decided to find a smooth place on the foothills near our 3
navigable pass, there grounding the plane and preparing to do some exploration 3
on foot. Though these gradual slopes were partly covered with a scattering of 3
ruins, low flying soon disclosed an ampler number of possible landing places. 3
Selecting that nearest to the pass, since our flight would be across the great range 3
and back to camp, we succeeded about 12:30 P.M. in effecting a landing on a 3
smooth, hard snow field wholly devoid of obstacles and well adapted to a swift 3
and favorable take- off later on. 3
3
It did not seem necessary to protect the plane with a snow banking for so brief a 3
time and in so comfortable an absence of high winds at this level; hence we 3
merely saw that the landing skis were safely lodged, and that the vital parts of 3
the mechanism were guarded against the cold. For our foot journey we discarded 3
the heaviest of our flying furs, and took with us a small outfit consisting of 3
pocket compass, hand camera, light provisions, voluminous notebooks and 3
paper, geologist's hammer and chisel, specimen bags, coil of climbing rope, and 3
powerful electric torches with extra batteries; this equipment having been carried 3
in the plane on the chance that we might be able to effect a landing, take ground 3
pictures, make drawings and topographical sketches, and obtain rock specimens 3
from some bare slope, outcropping, or mountain cave. Fortunately we had a 3
supply of extra paper to tear up, place in a spare specimen bag, and use on the 3
ancient principle of hare and hounds for marking our course in any interior 3
mazes we might be able to penetrate. This had been brought in case we found 3
some cave system with air quiet enough to allow such a rapid and easy method 3
in place of the usual rock-chipping method of trail blazing. 3
3
Walking cautiously downhill over the crusted snow toward the stupendous 3
stone labyrinth that loomed against the opalescent west, we felt almost as keen a 3
sense of imminent marvels as we had felt on approaching the unfathomed 3
mountain pass four hours previously. True, we had become visually familiar 3
with the incredible secret concealed by the barrier peaks; yet the prospect of 3
actually entering primordial walls reared by conscious beings perhaps millions 3
of years ago - before any known race of men could have existed - was none the 3
3
3
3
45 3
3
3
3
less awesome and potentially terrible in its implications of cosmic abnormality. 3
Though the thinness of the air at this prodigious altitude made exertion 3
somewhat more difficult than usual, both Danforth and I found ourselves 3
bearing up very well, and felt equal to almost any task which might fall to our 3
lot. It took only a few steps to bring us to a shapeless ruin worn level with the 3
snow, while ten or fifteen rods farther on there was a huge, roofless rampart still 3
complete in its gigantic five-pointed outline and rising to an irregular height of 3
ten or eleven feet. For this latter we headed; and when at last we were actually 3
able to touch its weathered Cyclopean blocks, we felt that we had established an 3
unprecedented and almost blasphemous link with forgotten aeons normally 3
closed to our species. 3
3
This rampart, shaped like a star and perhaps three hundred feet from point to 3
point, was built of Jurassic sandstone blocks of irregular size, averaging 6x8 feet 3
in surface. There was a row of arched loopholes or windows about four feet wide 3
and five feet high, spaced quite symmetrically along the points of the star and at 3
its inner angles, and with the bottoms about four feet from the glaciated surface. 3
Looking through these, we could see that the masonry was fully five feet thick, 3
that there were no partitions remaining within, and that there were traces of 3
banded carvings or bas-reliefs on the interior walls - facts we had indeed guessed 3
before, when flying low over this rampart and others like it. Though lower parts 3
must have originally existed, all traces of such things were now wholly obscured 3
by the deep layer of ice and snow at this point. 3
3
We crawled through one of the windows and vainly tried to decipher the nearly 3
effaced mural designs, but did not attempt to disturb the glaciated floor. Our 3
orientation flights had indicated that many buildings in the city proper were less 3
ice-choked, and that we might perhaps find wholly clear interiors leading down 3
to the true ground level if we entered those structures still roofed at the top. 3
Before we left the rampart we photographed it carefully, and studied its mortar- 3
less Cyclopean masonry with complete bewilderment. We wished that Pabodie 3
were present, for his engineering knowledge might have helped us guess how 3
such titanic blocks could have been handled in that unbelievably remote age 3
when the city and its outskirts were built up. 3
3
The half-mile walk downhill to the actual city, with the upper wind shrieking 3
vainly and savagely through the skyward peaks in the background, was 3
something of which the smallest details will always remain engraved on my 3
mind. Only in fantastic nightmares could any human beings but Danforth and 3
me conceive such optical effects. Between us and the churning vapors of the west 3
lay that monstrous tangle of dark stone towers, its outre and incredible forms 3
impressing us afresh at every new angle of vision. It was a mirage in solid stone, 3
and were it not for the photographs, I would still doubt that such a thing could 3
3
3
3
46 3
3
3
3
be. The general type of masonry was identical with that of the rampart we had 3
examined; but the extravagant shapes which this masonry took in its urban 3
manifestations were past all description. 3
3
Even the pictures illustrate only one or two phases of its endless variety, 3
preternatural massiveness, and utterly alien exoticism. There were geometrical 3
forms for which an Euclid would scarcely find a name - cones of all degrees of 3
irregularity and truncation, terraces of every sort of provocative disproportion, 3
shafts with odd bulbous enlargements, broken columns in curious groups, and 3
five-pointed or five-ridged arrangements of mad grotesqueness. As we drew 3
nearer we could see beneath certain transparent parts of the ice sheet, and detect 3
some of the tubular stone bridges that connected the crazily sprinkled structures 3
at various heights. Of orderly streets there seemed to be none, the only broad 3
open swath being a mile to the left, where the ancient river had doubtless flowed 3
through the town into the mountains. 3
3
Our field glasses showed the external, horizontal bands of nearly effaced 3
sculptures and dot groups to be very prevalent, and we could half imagine what 3
the city must once have looked like - even though most of the roofs and tower 3
tops had necessarily perished. As a whole, it had been a complex tangle of 3
twisted lanes and alleys, all of them deep canyons, and some little better than 3
tunnels because of the overhanging masonry or overarching bridges. Now, 3
outspread below us, it loomed like a dream fantasy against a westward mist 3
through whose northern end the low, reddish antarctic sun of early afternoon 3
was struggling to shine; and when, for a moment, that sun encountered a denser 3
obstruction and plunged the scene into temporary shadow, the effect was subtly 3
menacing in a way I can never hope to depict. Even the faint howling and piping 3
of the unfelt wind in the great mountain passes behind us took on a wilder note 3
of purposeful malignity. The last stage of our descent to the town was unusually 3
steep and abrupt, and a rock outcropping at the edge where the grade changed 3
led us to think that an artificial terrace had once existed there. Under the 3
glaciation, we believed, there must be a flight of steps or its equivalent. 3
3
When at last we plunged into the town itself, clambering over fallen masonry 3
and shrinking from the oppressive nearness and dwarfing height of omnipresent 3
crumbling and pitted walls, our sensations again became such that I marvel at 3
the amount of self-control we retained. Danforth was frankly jumpy, and began 3
making some offensively irrelevant speculations about the horror at the camp - 3
which I resented all the more because I could not help sharing certain 3
conclusions forced upon us by many features of this morbid survival from 3
nightmare antiquity. The speculations worked on his imagination, too; for in one 3
place - where a debris-littered alley turned a sharp corner - he insisted that he 3
saw faint traces of ground markings which he did not like; whilst elsewhere he 3
3
3
3
47 3
3
3
3
stopped to listen to a subtle, imaginary sound from some undefined point - a 3
muffled musical piping, he said, not unlike that of the wind in the mountain 3
caves, yet somehow disturbingly different. The ceaseless five-pointedness of the 3
surrounding architecture and of the few distinguishable mural arabesques had a 3
dimly sinister suggestiveness we could not escape, and gave us a touch of 3
terrible subconscious certainty concerning the primal entities which had reared 3
and dwelt in this unhallowed place. 3
3
Nevertheless, our scientific and adventurous souls were not wholly dead, and 3
we mechanically carried out our program of chipping specimens from all the 3
different rock types represented in the masonry. We wished a rather full set in 3
order to draw better conclusions regarding the age of the place. Nothing in the 3
great outer walls seemed to date from later than the Jurassic and Comanchian 3
periods, nor was any piece of stone in the entire place of a greater recency than 3
the Pliocene Age. In stark certainty, we were wandering amidst a death which 3
had reigned at least five hundred thousand years, and in all probability even 3
longer. 3
3
As we proceeded through this maze of stone-shadowed twilight we stopped at 3
all available apertures to study interiors and investigate entrance possibilities. 3
Some were above our reach, whilst others led only into ice-choked ruins as 3
unroofed and barren as the rampart on the hill. One, though spacious and 3
inviting, opened on a seemingly bottomless abyss without visible means of 3
descent. Now and then we had a chance to study the petrified wood of a 3
surviving shutter, and were impressed by the fabulous antiquity implied in the 3
still discernible grain. These things had come from Mesozoic gymnosperms and 3
conifers - especially Cretaceous cycads - and from fan palms and early 3
angiosperms of plainly Tertiary date. Nothing definitely later than the Pliocene 3
could be discovered. In the placing of these shutters - whose edges showed the 3
former presence of queer and long-vanished hinges - usage seemed to be varied - 3
some being on the outer and some on the inner side of the deep embrasures. 3
They seemed to have become wedged in place, thus surviving the rusting of their 3
former and probably metallic fixtures and fastenings. 3
3
After a time we came across a row of windows - in the bulges of a colossal five- 3
edged cone of undamaged apex - which led into a vast, well-preserved room 3
with stone flooring; but these were too high in the room to permit descent 3
without a rope. We had a rope with us, but did not wish to bother with this 3
twenty-foot drop unless obliged to-especially in this thin plateau air where great 3
demands were made upon the heart action. This enormous room was probably a 3
hall or concourse of some sort, and our electric torches showed bold, distinct, 3
and potentially startling sculptures arranged round the walls in broad, 3
horizontal bands separated by equally broad strips of conventional arabesques. 3
3
3
3
48 3
3
3
3
We took careful note of this spot, planning to enter here unless a more easily 3
gained interior were encountered. 3
3
Finally, though, we did encounter exactly the opening we wished; an archway 3
about six feet wide and ten feet high, marking the former end of an aerial bridge 3
which had spanned an alley about five feet above the present level of glaciation. 3
These archways, of course, were flush with upper-story floors, and in this case 3
one of the floors still existed. The building thus accessible was a series of 3
rectangular terraces on our left facing westward. That across the alley, where the 3
other archway yawned, was a decrepit cylinder with no windows and with a 3
curious bulge about ten feet above the aperture. It was totally dark inside, and 3
the archway seemed to open on a well of illimitable emptiness. 3
3
Heaped debris made the entrance to the vast left-hand building doubly easy, yet 3
for a moment we hesitated before taking advantage of the long-wished chance. 3
For though we had penetrated into this tangle of archaic mystery, it required 3
fresh resolution to carry us actually inside a complete and surviving building of a 3
fabulous elder world whose nature was becoming more and more hideously 3
plain to us. In the end, however, we made the plunge, and scrambled up over the 3
rubble into the gaping embrasure. The floor beyond was of great slate slabs, and 3
seemed to form the outlet of a long, high corridor with sculptured walls. 3
3
Observing the many inner archways which led off from it, and realizing the 3
probable complexity of the nest of apartments within, we decided that we must 3
begin our system of hare-and-hound trail blazing. Hitherto our compasses, 3
together with frequent glimpses of the vast mountain range between the towers 3
in our rear, had been enough to prevent our losing our way; but from now on, 3
the artificial substitute would be necessary. Accordingly we reduced our extra 3
paper to shreds of suitable size, placed these in a bag to be carried by Danforth, 3
and prepared to use them as economically as safety would allow. This method 3
would probably gain us immunity from straying, since there did not appear to be 3
any strong air currents inside the primordial masonry. If such should develop, or 3
if our paper supply should give out, we could of course fall back on the more 3
secure though more tedious and retarding method of rock chipping. 3
3
Just how extensive a territory we had opened up, it was impossible to guess 3
without a trial. The close and frequent connection of the different buildings made 3
it likely that we might cross from one to another on bridges underneath the ice, 3
except where impeded by local collapses and geologic rifts, for very little 3
glaciation seemed to have entered the massive constructions. Almost all the areas 3
of transparent ice had revealed the submerged windows as tightly shuttered, as 3
if the town had been left in that uniform state until the glacial sheet came to 3
crystallize the lower part for all succeeding time. Indeed, one gained a curious 3
3
3
3
49 3
3
3
3
impression that this place had been dehberately closed and deserted in some 3
dim, bygone aeon, rather than overwhelmed by any sudden calamity or even 3
gradual decay. Had the coming of the ice been foreseen, and had a nameless 3
population left en masse to seek a less doomed abode? The precise physiographic 3
conditions attending the formation of the ice sheet at this point would have to 3
wait for later solution. It had not, very plainly, been a grinding drive. Perhaps 3
the pressure of accumulated snows had been responsible, and perhaps some 3
flood from the river, or from the bursting of some ancient glacial dam in the 3
great range, had helped to create the special state now observable. Imagination 3
could conceive almost anything in connection with this place. 3
3
VI 3
3
It would be cumbrous to give a detailed, consecutive account of our wanderings 3
inside that cavernous, aeon-dead honeycomb of primal masonry - that 3
monstrous lair of elder secrets which now echoed for the first time, after 3
uncounted epochs, to the tread of human feet. This is especially true because so 3
much of the horrible drama and revelation came from a mere study of the 3
omnipresent mural carvings. Our flashlight photographs of those carvings will 3
do much toward proving the truth of what we are now disclosing, and it is 3
lamentable that we had not a larger film supply with us. As it was, we made 3
crude notebook sketches of certain salient features after all our films were used 3
up. 3
3
The building which we had entered was one of great size and elaborateness, and 3
gave us an impressive notion of the architecture of that nameless geologic past. 3
The inner partitions were less massive than the outer walls, but on the lower 3
levels were excellently preserved. Labyrinthine complexity, involving curiously 3
irregular difference in floor levels, characterized the entire arrangement; and we 3
should certainly have been lost at the very outset but for the trail of torn paper 3
left behind us. We decided to explore the more decrepit upper parts first of all, 3
hence climbed aloft in the maze for a distance of some one hundred feet, to 3
where the topmost tier of chambers yawned snowily and ruinously open to the 3
polar sky. Ascent was effected over the steep, transversely ribbed stone ramps or 3
inclined planes which everywhere served in lieu of stairs. The rooms we 3
encountered were of all imaginable shapes and proportions, ranging from five- 3
pointed stars to triangles and perfect cubes. It might be safe to say that their 3
general average was about 30 x 30 feet in floor area, and 20 feet in height, though 3
many larger apartments existed. After thoroughly examining the upper regions 3
and the glacial level, we descended, story by story, into the submerged part, 3
where indeed we soon saw we were in a continuous maze of connected 3
chambers and passages probably leading over unlimited areas outside this 3
particular building. The Cyclopean massiveness and gigantism of everything 3
3
3
3
50 3
3
3
3
about us became curiously oppressive; and there was something vaguely but 3
deeply unhuman in all the contours, dimensions, proportions, decorations, and 3
constructional nuances of the blasphemously archaic stonework. We soon 3
realized, from what the carvings revealed, that this monstrous city was many 3
million years old. 3
3
We cannot yet explain the engineering principles used in the anomalous 3
balancing and adjustment of the vast rock masses, though the function of the 3
arch was clearly much relied on. The rooms we visited were wholly bare of all 3
portable contents, a circumstance which sustained our belief in the city's 3
deliberate desertion. The prime decorative feature was the almost universal 3
system of mural sculpture, which tended to run in continuous horizontal bands 3
three feet wide and arranged from floor to ceiling in alternation with bands of 3
equal width given over to geometrical arabesques. There were exceptions to this 3
rule of arrangement, but its preponderance was overwhelming. Often, however, 3
a series of smooth car-touches containing oddly patterned groups of dots would 3
be sunk along one of the arabesque bands. 3
3
The technique, we soon saw, was mature, accomplished, and aesthetically 3
evolved to the highest degree of civilized mastery, though utterly alien in every 3
detail to any known art tradition of the human race. In delicacy of execution no 3
sculpture I have ever seen could approach it. The minutest details of elaborate 3
vegetation, or of animal life, were rendered with astonishing vividness despite 3
the bold scale of the carvings; whilst the conventional designs were marvels of 3
skillful intricacy. The arabesques displayed a profound use of mathematical 3
principles, and were made up of obscurely symmetrical curves and angles based 3
on the quantity of five. The pictorial bands followed a highly formalized 3
tradition, and involved a peculiar treatment of perspective, but had an artistic 3
force that moved us profoundly, notwithstanding the intervening gulf of vast 3
geologic periods. Their method of design hinged on a singular juxtaposition of 3
the cross section with the two-dimensional silhouette, and embodied an 3
analytical psychology beyond that of any known race of antiquity. It is useless to 3
try to compare this art with any represented in our museums. Those who see our 3
photographs will probably find its closest analogue in certain grotesque 3
conceptions of the most daring futurists. 3
3
The arabesque tracery consisted altogether of depressed lines, whose depth on 3
unweathered walls varied from one to two inches. When cartouches with dot 3
groups appeared - evidently as inscriptions in some unknown and primordial 3
language and alphabet - the depression of the smooth surface was perhaps an 3
inch and a half, and of the dots perhaps a half inch more. The pictorial bands 3
were in countersunk low relief, their background being depressed about two 3
inches from the original wall surface. In some specimens marks of a former 3
3
3
3
51 3
3
3
3
coloration could be detected, though for the most part the untold aeons had 3
disintegrated and banished any pigments which may have been applied. The 3
more one studied the marvelous technique, the more one admired the things. 3
Beneath their strict conventionalization one could grasp the minute and accurate 3
observation and graphic skill of the artists; and indeed, the very conventions 3
themselves served to symbolize and accentuate the real essence or vital 3
differentiation of every object delineated. We felt, too, that besides these 3
recognizable excellences there were others lurking beyond the reach of our 3
perceptions. Certain touches here and there gave vague hints of latent symbols 3
and stimuli which another mental and emotional background, and a fuller or 3
different sensory equipment, might have made of profound and poignant 3
significance to us. 3
3
The subject matter of the sculptures obviously came from the life of the vanished 3
epoch of their creation, and contained a large proportion of evident history. It is 3
this abnormal historic-mindedness of the primal race - a chance circumstance 3
operating, through coincidence, miraculously in our favor - which made the 3
carvings so awesomely informative to us, and which caused us to place their 3
photography and transcription above all other considerations. In certain rooms 3
the dominant arrangement was varied by the presence of maps, astronomical 3
charts, and other scientific designs of an enlarged scale - these things giving a 3
naive and terrible corroboration to what we gathered from the pictorial friezes 3
and dadoes. In hinting at what the whole revealed, I can only hope that my 3
account will not arouse a curiosity greater than sane caution on the part of those 3
who believe me at all. It would be tragic if any were to be allured to that realm of 3
death and horror by the very warning meant to discourage them. 3
3
Interrupting these sculptured walls were high windows and massive twelve-foot 3
doorways; both now and then retaining the petrified wooden planks - 3
elaborately carved and polished-of the actual shutters and doors. All metal 3
fixtures had long ago vanished, but some of the doors remained in place and had 3
to be forced aside as we progressed from room to room. Window frames with 3
odd transparent panes - mostly elliptical - survived here and there, though in no 3
considerable quantity. There were also frequent niches of great magnitude, 3
generally empty, but once in a while containing some bizarre object carved from 3
green soapstone which was either broken or perhaps held too inferior to warrant 3
removal. Other apertures were undoubtedly connected with bygone mechanical 3
facilities - heating, lighting, and the like-of a sort suggested in many of the 3
carvings. Ceilings tended to be plain, but had sometimes been inlaid with green 3
soapstone or other tiles, mostly fallen now. Floors were also paved with such 3
tiles, though plain stonework predominated. 3
3
3
3
52 3
3
3
3
As I have said, all furniture and other movables were absent; but the sculptures 3
gave a clear idea of the strange devices which had once filled these tomblike, 3
echoing rooms. Above the glacial sheet the floors were generally thick with 3
detritus, litter, and debris, but farther down this condition decreased. In some of 3
the lower chambers and corridors there was little more than gritty dust or 3
ancient incrustations, while occasional areas had an uncanny air of newly swept 3
immaculateness. Of course, where rifts or collapses had occurred, the lower 3
levels were as littered as the upper ones. A central court - as in other structures 3
we had seen from the air - saved the inner regions from total darkness; so that we 3
seldom had to use our electric torches in the upper rooms except when studying 3
sculptured details. Below the ice cap, however, the twilight deepened; and in 3
many parts of the tangled ground level there was an approach to absolute 3
blackness. 3
3
To form even a rudimentary idea of our thoughts and feelings as we penetrated 3
this aeon-silent maze of unhuman masonry, one must correlate a hopelessly 3
bewildering chaos of fugitive moods, memories, and impressions. The sheer 3
appalling antiquity and lethal desolation of the place were enough to overwhelm 3
almost any sensitive person, but added to these elements were the recent 3
unexplained horror at the camp, and the revelations all too soon effected by the 3
terrible mural sculptures around us. The moment we came upon a perfect section 3
of carving, where no ambiguity of interpretation could exist, it took only a brief 3
study to give us the hideous truth - a truth which it would be naive to claim 3
Danforth and I had not independently suspected before, though we had carefully 3
refrained from even hinting it to each other. There could now be no further 3
merciful doubt about the nature of the beings which had built and inhabited this 3
monstrous dead city millions of years ago, when man's ancestors were primitive 3
archaic mammals, and vast dinosaurs roamed the tropical steppes of Europe and 3
Asia. 3
3
We had previously clung to a desperate alternative and insisted - each to himself 3
- that the omnipresence of the five-pointed motifs meant only some cultural or 3
religious exaltation of the Archaean natural object which had so patently 3
embodied the quality of five-pointedness; as the decorative motifs of Minoan 3
Crete exalted the sacred bull, those of Egypt the scarabaeus, those of Rome the 3
wolf and the eagle, and those of various savage tribes some chosen totem animal. 3
But this lone refuge was now stripped from us, and we were forced to face 3
definitely the reason-shaking realization which the reader of these pages has 3
doubtless long ago anticipated. I can scarcely bear to write it down in black and 3
white even now, but perhaps that will not be necessary. 3
3
The things once rearing and dwelling in this frightful masonry in the age of 3
dinosaurs were not indeed dinosaurs, but far worse. Mere dinosaurs were new 3
3
3
3
53 3
3
3
3
and almost brainless objects - but the builders of the city were wise and old, and 3
had left certain traces in rocks even then laid down well nigh a thousand million 3
years - rocks laid down before the true life of earth had advanced beyond plastic 3
groups of cells - rocks laid down before the true life of earth had existed at all. 3
They were the makers and enslavers of that life, and above all doubt the originals 3
of the fiendish elder myths which things like the Pnakotic Manuscripts and the 3
Necronomicon affrightedly hint about. They were the great "Old Ones" that had 3
filtered down from the stars when earth was young - the beings whose substance 3
an alien evolution had shaped, and whose powers were such as this planet had 3
never bred. And to think that only the day before Danforth and I had actually 3
looked upon fragments of their millennially fossilized substance - and that poor 3
Lake and his party had seen their complete outlines - It is of course impossible 3
for me to relate in proper order the stages by which we picked up what we know 3
of that monstrous chapter of prehuman life. After the first shock of the certain 3
revelation, we had to pause a while to recuperate, and it was fully three o'clock 3
before we got started on our actual tour of systematic research. The sculptures in 3
the building we entered were of relatively late date - perhaps two million years 3
ago-as checked up by geological, biological, and astronomical features - and 3
embodied an art which would be called decadent in comparison with that of 3
specimens we found in older buildings after crossing bridges under the glacial 3
sheet. One edifice hewn from the solid rock seemed to go back forty or possibly 3
even fifty million years - to the lower Eocene or upper Cretaceous - and 3
contained bas-reliefs of an artistry surpassing anything else, with one 3
tremendous exception, that we encountered. That was, we have since agreed, the 3
oldest domestic structure we traversed. 3
3
Were it not for the support of those flashlights soon to be made public, I would 3
refrain from telling what I found and inferred, lest I be confined as a madman. Of 3
course, the infinitely early parts of the patchwork tale - representing the 3
preterrestrial life of the star-headed beings on other planets, in other galaxies, 3
and in other universes - can readily be interpreted as the fantastic mythology of 3
those beings themselves; yet such parts sometimes involved designs and 3
diagrams so uncannily close to the latest findings of mathematics and 3
astrophysics that I scarcely know what to think. Let others judge when they see 3
the photographs I shall publish. 3
3
Naturally, no one set of carvings which we encountered told more than a fraction 3
of any connected story, nor did we even begin to come upon the various stages 3
of that story in their proper order. Some of the vast rooms were independent 3
units so far as their designs were concerned, whilst in other cases a continuous 3
chronicle would be carried through a series of rooms and corridors. The best of 3
the maps and diagrams were on the walls of a frightful abyss below even the 3
ancient ground level - a cavern perhaps two hundred feet square and sixty feet 3
3
3
3
54 3
3
3
3
high, which had almost undoubtedly been an educational center of some sort. 3
There were many provoking repetitions of the same material in different rooms 3
and buildings, since certain chapters of experience, and certain summaries or 3
phases of racial history, had evidently been favorites with different decorators or 3
dwellers. Sometimes, though, variant versions of the same theme proved useful 3
in settling debatable points and filling up gaps. 3
3
I still wonder that we deduced so much in the short time at our disposal. Of 3
course, we even now have only the barest outline - and much of that was 3
obtained later on from a study of the photographs and sketches we made. It may 3
be the effect of this later study - the revived memories and vague impressions 3
acting in conjunction with his general sensitiveness and with that final supposed 3
horror-glimpse whose essence he will not reveal even to me - which has been the 3
immediate source of Danforth's present breakdown. But it had to be; for we 3
could not issue our warning intelligently without the fullest possible 3
information, and the issuance of that warning is a prime necessity. Certain 3
lingering influences in that unknown antarctic world of disordered time and 3
alien natural law make it imperative that further exploration be discouraged. 3
3
VII 3
3
The full story, so far as deciphered, will eventually appear in an official bulletin 3
of Miskatonic University. Here I shall sketch only the salient highlights in a 3
formless, rambling way. Myth or otherwise, the sculptures told of the coming of 3
those star-headed things to the nascent, lifeless earth out of cosmic space - their 3
coming, and the coming of many other alien entities such as at certain times 3
embark upon spatial pioneering. They seemed able to traverse the interstellar 3
ether on their vast membranous wings - thus oddly confirming some curious hill 3
folklore long ago told me by an antiquarian colleague. They had lived under the 3
sea a good deal, building fantastic cities and fighting terrific battles with 3
nameless adversaries by means of intricate devices employing unknown 3
principles of energy. Evidently their scientific and mechanical knowledge far 3
surpassed man's today, though they made use of its more widespread and 3
elaborate forms only when obliged to. Some of the sculptures suggested that they 3
had passed through a stage of mechanized life on other planets, but had receded 3
upon finding its effects emotionally unsatisfying. Their preternatural toughness 3
of organization and simplicity of natural wants made them peculiarly able to live 3
on a high plane without the more specialized fruits of artificial manufacture, and 3
even without garments, except for occasional protection against the elements. 3
3
It was under the sea, at first for food and later for other purposes, that they first 3
created earth life - using available substances according to long-known methods. 3
The more elaborate experiments came after the annihilation of various cosmic 3
3
3
3
55 3
3
3
3
enemies. They had done the same thing on other planets, having manufactured 3
not only necessary foods, but certain multicellular protoplasmic masses capable 3
of molding their tissues into all sorts of temporary organs under hypnotic 3
influence and thereby forming ideal slaves to perform the heavy work of the 3
community. These viscous masses were without doubt what Abdul Alhazred 3
whispered about as the "Shoggoths" in his frightful Necronomicon, though even 3
that mad Arab had not hinted that any existed on earth except in the dreams of 3
those who had chewed a certain alkaloidal herb. When the star-headed Old Ones 3
on this planet had synthesized their simple food forms and bred a good supply 3
of Shoggoths, they allowed other cell groups to develop into other forms of 3
animal and vegetable life for sundry purposes, extirpating any whose presence 3
became troublesome. 3
3
With the aid of the Shoggoths, whose expansions could be made to lift 3
prodigious weights, the small, low cities under the sea grew to vast and 3
imposing labyrinths of stone not unlike those which later rose on land. Indeed, 3
the highly adaptable Old Ones had lived much on land in other parts of the 3
universe, and probably retained many traditions of land construction. As we 3
studied the architecture of all these sculptured palaeogean cities, including that 3
whose aeon-dead corridors we were even then traversing, we were impressed by 3
a curious coincidence which we have not yet tried to explain, even to ourselves. 3
The tops of the buildings, which in the actual city around us had, of course, been 3
weathered into shapeless ruins ages ago, were clearly displayed in the bas- 3
reliefs, and showed vast clusters of needle-like spires, delicate finials on certain 3
cone and pyramid apexes, and tiers of thin, horizontal scalloped disks capping 3
cylindrical shafts. This was exactly what we had seen in that monstrous and 3
portentous mirage, cast by a dead city whence such skyline features had been 3
absent for thousands and tens of thousands of years, which loomed on our 3
ignorant eyes across the unfathomed mountains of madness as we first 3
approached poor Lake's ill-fated camp. 3
3
Of the life of the Old Ones, both under the sea and after part of them migrated to 3
land, volumes could be written. Those in shallow water had continued the fullest 3
use of the eyes at the ends of their five main head tentacles, and had practiced 3
the arts of sculpture and of writing in quite the usual way - the writing 3
accomplished with a stylus on waterproof waxen surfaces. Those lower down in 3
the ocean depths, though they used a curious phosphorescent organism to 3
furnish light, pieced out their vision with obscure special senses operating 3
through the prismatic cilia on their heads - senses which rendered all the Old 3
Ones partly independent of light in emergencies. Their forms of sculpture and 3
writing had changed curiously during the descent, embodying certain 3
apparently chemical coating processes - probably to secure phosphorescence - 3
which the basreliefs could not make clear to us. The beings moved in the sea 3
3
3
3
56 3
3
3
3
partly by swimming - using the lateral crinoid arms - and partly by wriggling 3
with the lower tier of tentacles containing the pseudofeet. Occasionally they 3
accomplished long swoops with the auxiliary use of two or more sets of their 3
fanlike folding wings. On land they locally used the pseudofeet, but now and 3
then flew to great heights or over long distances with their wings. The many 3
slender tentacles into which the crinoid arms branched were infinitely delicate, 3
flexible, strong, and accurate in muscular-nervous coordination - ensuring the 3
utmost skill and dexterity in all artistic and other manual operations. 3
3
The toughness of the things was almost incredible. Even the terrific pressure of 3
the deepest sea bottoms appeared powerless to harm them. Very few seemed to 3
die at all except by violence, and their burial places were very limited. The fact 3
that they covered their vertically inhumed dead with five-pointed inscribed 3
mounds set up thoughts in Danforth and me which made a fresh pause and 3
recuperation necessary after the sculptures revealed it. The beings multiplied by 3
means of spores - like vegetable pteridophytes, as Lake had suspected - but, 3
owing to their prodigious toughness and longevity, and consequent lack of 3
replacement needs, they did not encourage the large-scale development of new 3
prothallia except when they had new regions to colonize. The young matured 3
swiftly, and received an education evidently beyond any standard we can 3
imagine. The prevailing intellectual and aesthetic life was highly evolved, and 3
produced a tenaciously enduring set of customs and institutions which I shall 3
describe more fully in my coming monograph. These varied slightly according to 3
sea or land residence, but had the same foundations and essentials. 3
3
Though able, like vegetables, to derive nourishment from inorganic substances, 3
they vastly preferred organic and especially animal food. They ate uncooked 3
marine life under the sea, but cooked their viands on land. They hunted game 3
and raised meat herds - slaughtering with sharp weapons whose odd marks on 3
certain fossil bones our expedition had noted. They resisted all ordinary 3
temperatures marvelously, and in their natural state could live in water down to 3
freezing. When the great chill of the Pleistocene drew on, however - nearly a 3
million years ago-the land dwellers had to resort to special measures, including 3
artificial heating - until at last the deadly cold appears to have driven them back 3
into the sea. For their prehistoric flights through cosmic space, legend said, they 3
absorbed certain chemicals and became almost independent of eating, breathing, 3
or heat conditions - but by the time of the great cold they had lost track of the 3
method. In any case they could not have prolonged the artificial state indefinitely 3
without harm. 3
3
Being nonpairing and semivegetable in structure, the Old Ones had no biological 3
basis for the family phase of mammal life, but seemed to organize large 3
households on the principles of comfortable space- utility and - as we deduced 3
3
3
3
bl 3
3
3
3
from the pictured occupations and diversions of co-dwellers - congenial mental 3
association. In furnishing their homes they kept everything in the center of the 3
huge rooms, leaving all the wall spaces free for decorative treatment. Lighting, in 3
the case of the land inhabitants, was accomplished by a device probably electro- 3
chemical in nature. Both on land and under water they used curious tables, 3
chairs and couches like cylindrical frames - for they rested and slept upright with 3
folded- down tentacles - and racks for hinged sets of dotted surfaces forming 3
their books. 3
3
Government was evidently complex and probably socialistic, though no 3
certainties in this regard could be deduced from the sculptures we saw. There 3
was extensive commerce, both local and between different cities - certain small, 3
flat counters, five-pointed and inscribed, serving as money. Probably the smaller 3
of the various greenish soapstones found by our expedition were pieces of such 3
currency. Though the culture was mainly urban, some agriculture and much 3
stock raising existed. Mining and a limited amount of manufacturing were also 3
practiced. Travel was very frequent, but permanent migration seemed relatively 3
rare except for the vast colonizing movements by which the race expanded. For 3
personal locomotion no external aid was used, since in land, air, and water 3
movement alike the Old Ones seemed to possess excessively vast capacities for 3
speed. Loads, however, were drawn by beasts of burden - Shoggoths under the 3
sea, and a curious variety of primitive vertebrates in the later years of land 3
existence. 3
3
These vertebrates, as well as an infinity of other life forms - animal and 3
vegetable, marine, terrestrial, and aerial - were the products of unguided 3
evolution acting on life cells made by the Old Ones, but escaping beyond their 3
radius of attention. They had been suffered to develop unchecked because they 3
had not come in conflict with the dominant beings. Bothersome forms, of course, 3
were mechanically exterminated. It interested us to see in some of the very last 3
and most decadent sculptures a shambling, primitive mammal, used sometimes 3
for food and sometimes as an amusing buffoon by the land dwellers, whose 3
vaguely simian and human foreshadowings were unmistakable. In the building 3
of land cities the huge stone blocks of the high towers were generally lifted by 3
vast-winged pterodactyls of a species heretofore unknown to paleontology. 3
3
The persistence with which the Old Ones survived various geologic changes and 3
convulsions of the earth's crust was little short of miraculous. Though few or 3
none of their first cities seem to have remained beyond the Archaean Age, there 3
was no interruption in their civilization or in the transmission of their records. 3
Their original place of advent to the planet was the Antarctic Ocean, and it is 3
likely that they came not long after the matter forming the moon was wrenched 3
from the neighboring South Pacific. According to one of the sculptured maps the 3
3
3
3
58 3
3
3
3
whole globe was then under water, with stone cities scattered farther and farther 3
from the antarctic as aeons passed. Another map shows a vast bulk of dry land 3
around the south pole, where it is evident that some of the beings made 3
experimental settlements, though their main centers were transferred to the 3
nearest sea bottom. Later maps, which display the land mass as cracking and 3
drifting, and sending certain detached parts northward, uphold in a striking way 3
the theories of continental drift lately advanced by Taylor, Wegener, and Joly. 3
3
With the upheaval of new land in the South Pacific tremendous events began. 3
Some of the marine cities were hopelessly shattered, yet that was not the worst 3
misfortune. Another race - a land race of beings shaped like octopi and probably 3
corresponding to fabulous prehuman spawn of Cthulhu - soon began filtering 3
down from cosmic infinity and precipitated a -monstrous war which for a time 3
drove the Old Ones wholly back to the sea - a colossal blow in view of the 3
increasing land settlements. Later peace was made, and the new lands were 3
given to the Cthulhu spawn whilst the Old Ones held the sea and the older 3
lands. New land cities were founded - the greatest of them in the antarctic, for 3
this region of first arrival was sacred. From then on, as before, the antarctic 3
remained the center of the Old Ones' civilization, and all the cities built there by 3
the Cthulhu spawn were blotted out. Then suddenly the lands of the Pacific sank 3
again, taking with them the frightful stone city of R'lyeh and all the cosmic 3
octopi, so that the Old Ones were again supreme on the planet except for one 3
shadowy fear about which they did not like to speak. At a rather later age their 3
cities dotted all the land and water areas of the globe - hence the 3
recommendation in my coming monograph that some archaeologist make 3
systematic borings with Pabodie's type of apparatus in certain widely separated 3
regions. 3
3
The steady trend down the ages was from water to land - a movement 3
encouraged by the rise of new land masses, though the ocean was never wholly 3
deserted. Another cause of the landward movement was the new difficulty in 3
breeding and managing the Shoggoths upon which successful sea life depended. 3
With the march of time, as the sculptures sadly confessed, the art of creating new 3
life from inorganic matter had been lost, so that the Old Ones had to depend on 3
the molding of forms already in existence. On land the great reptiles proved 3
highly tractable; but the Shoggoths of the sea, reproducing by fission and 3
acquiring a dangerous degree of accidental intelligence, presented for a time a 3
formidable problem. 3
3
They had always been controlled through the hypnotic suggestions of the Old 3
Ones, and had modeled their tough plasticity into various useful temporary 3
limbs and organs; but now their self-modeling powers were sometimes exercised 3
independently, and in various imitative forms implanted by past suggestion. 3
3
3
3
59 3
3
3
3
They had, it seems, developed a semistable brain whose separate and 3
occasionally stubborn volition echoed the will of the Old Ones without always 3
obeying it. Sculptured images of these Shoggoths filled Danforth and me with 3
horror and loathing. They were normally shapeless entities composed of a 3
viscous jelly which looked like an agglutination of bubbles, and each averaged 3
about fifteen feet in diameter when a sphere. They had, however, a constantly 3
shifting shape and volume - throwing out temporary developments or forming 3
apparent organs of sight, hearing, and speech in imitation of their masters, either 3
spontaneously or according to suggestion. 3
3
They seem to have become peculiarly intractable toward the middle of the 3
Permian Age, perhaps one hundred and fifty million years ago, when a veritable 3
war of resubjugation was waged upon them by the marine Old Ones. Pictures of 3
this war, and of the headless, slime-coated fashion in which the Shoggoths 3
typically left their slain victims, held a marvelously fearsome quality despite the 3
intervening abyss of untold ages. The Old Ones had used curious weapons of 3
molecular and atomic disturbances against the rebel entities, and in the end had 3
achieved a complete victory. Thereafter the sculptures showed a period in which 3
Shoggoths were tamed and broken by armed Old Ones as the wild horses of the 3
American west were tamed by cowboys. Though during the rebellion the 3
Shoggoths had shown an ability to live out of water, this transition was not 3
encouraged - since their usefulness on land would hardly have been 3
commensurate with the trouble of their management. 3
3
During the Jurassic Age the Old Ones met fresh adversity in the form of a new 3
invasion from outer space - this time by half-fungous, half-crustacean creatures - 3
creatures undoubtedly the same as those figuring in certain whispered hill 3
legends of the north, and remembered in the Himalayas as the Mi-Go, or 3
abominable Snow Men. To fight these beings the Old Ones attempted, for the 3
first time since their terrene advent, to sally forth again into the planetary ether; 3
but, despite all traditional preparations, found it no longer possible to leave the 3
earth's atmosphere. Whatever the old secret of interstellar travel had been, it was 3
now definitely lost to the race. In the end the Mi-Go drove the Old Ones out of all 3
the northern lands, though they were powerless to disturb those in the sea. Little 3
by little the slow retreat of the elder race to their original antarctic habitat was 3
beginning. 3
3
It was curious to note from the pictured battles that both the Cthulhu spawn and 3
the Mi-Go seem to have been composed of matter more widely different from 3
that which we know than was the substance of the Old Ones. They were able to 3
undergo transformations and reintegrations impossible for their adversaries, and 3
seem therefore to have originally come from even remoter gulfs of the cosmic 3
space. The Old Ones, but for their abnormal toughness and peculiar vital 3
3
3
3
60 3
3
3
3
properties, were strictly material, and must have had their absolute origin within 3
the known space-time continuum - whereas the first sources of the other beings 3
can only be guessed at with bated breath. All this, of course, assuming that the 3
non-terrestrial linkages and the anomalies ascribed to the invading foes are not 3
pure mythology. Conceivably, the Old Ones might have invented a cosmic 3
framework to account for their occasional defeats, since historical interest and 3
pride obviously formed their chief psychological element. It is significant that 3
their annals failed to mention many advanced and potent races of beings whose 3
mighty cultures and towering cities figure persistently in certain obscure 3
legends. 3
3
The changing state of the world through long geologic ages appeared with 3
startling vividness in many of the sculptured maps and scenes. In certain cases 3
existing science will require revision, while in other cases its bold deductions are 3
magnificently confirmed. As I have said, the hypothesis of Taylor, Wegener, and 3
Joly that all the continents are fragments of an original antarctic land mass which 3
cracked from centrifugal force and drifted apart over a technically viscous lower 3
surface - an hypothesis suggested by such things as the complementary outlines 3
of Africa and South America, and the way the great mountain chains are rolled 3
and shoved up - receives striking support from this uncanny source. 3
3
Maps evidently showing the Carboniferous world of an hundred million or more 3
years ago displayed significant rifts and chasms destined later to separate Africa 3
from the once continuous realms of Europe (then the Valusia of primal legend), 3
Asia, the Americas, and the antarctic continent. Other charts - and most 3
significantly one in connection with the founding fifty million years ago of the 3
vast dead city around us - showed all the present continents well differentiated. 3
And in the latest discoverable specimen - dating perhaps from the Pliocene Age - 3
the approximate world of today appeared quite clearly despite the linkage of 3
Alaska with Siberia, of North America with Europe through Greenland, and of 3
South America with the antarctic continent through Graham Land. In the 3
Carboniferous map the whole globe-ocean floor and rifted land mass alike - bore 3
symbols of the Old Ones' vast stone cities, but in the later charts the gradual 3
recession toward the antarctic became very plain. The final Pliocene specimen 3
showed no land cities except on the antarctic continent and the tip of South 3
America, nor any ocean cities north of the fiftieth parallel of South Latitude. 3
Knowledge and interest in the northern world, save for a study of coast lines 3
probably made during long exploration flights on those fanlike membranous 3
wings, had evidently declined to zero among the Old Ones. 3
3
Destruction of cities through the upthrust of mountains, the centrifugal rending 3
of continents, the seismic convulsions of land or sea bottom, and other natural 3
causes, was a matter of common record; and it was curious to observe how fewer 3
3
3
3
61 3
3
3
3
and fewer replacements were made as the ages wore on. The vast dead 3
megalopoHs that yawned around us seemed to be the last general center of the 3
race - built early in the Cretaceous Age after a titanic earth buckling had 3
obliterated a still vaster predecessor not far distant. It appeared that this general 3
region was the most sacred spot of all, where reputedly the first Old Ones had 3
settled on a primal sea bottom. In the new city - many of whose features we 3
could recognize in the sculptures, but which stretched fully a hundred miles 3
along the mountain range in each direction beyond the farthest limits of our 3
aerial survey - there were reputed to be preserved certain sacred stones forming 3
part of the first sea-bottom city, which thrust up to light after long epochs in the 3
course of the general crumbling of strata. 3
3
VIII 3
3
Naturally, Danforth and I studied with especial interest and a peculiarly 3
personal sense of awe everything pertaining to the immediate district in which 3
we were. Of this local material there was naturally a vast abundance; and on the 3
tangled ground level of the city we were lucky enough to find a house of very 3
late date whose walls, though somewhat damaged by a neighboring rift, 3
contained sculptures of decadent workmanship carrying the story of the region 3
much beyond the period of the Pliocene map whence we derived our last general 3
glimpse of the prehuman world. This was the last place we examined in detail, 3
since what we found there gave us a fresh immediate objective. 3
3
Certainly, we were in one of the strangest, weirdest, and most terrible of all the 3
corners of earth's globe. Of all existing lands, it was infinitely the most ancient. 3
The conviction grew upon us that this hideous upland must indeed be the fabled 3
nightmare plateau of Leng which even the mad author of the Necronomicon was 3
reluctant to discuss. The great mountain chain was tremendously long - starting 3
as a low range at Luitpold Land on the east coast of Weddell Sea and virtually 3
crossing the entire continent. That really high part stretched in a mighty arc from 3
about Latitude 82°, E. Longitude 60° to Latitude 70°, E. Longitude 115°, with its 3
concave side toward our camp and its seaward end in the region of that long, ice- 3
locked coast whose hills were glimpsed by Wilkes and Mawson at the antarctic 3
circle. 3
3
Yet even more monstrous exaggerations of nature seemed disturbingly close at 3
hand. I have said that these peaks are higher than the Himalayas, but the 3
sculptures forbid me to say that they are earth's highest. That grim honor is 3
beyond doubt reserved for something which half the sculptures hesitated to 3
record at all, whilst others approached it with obvious repugnance and 3
trepidation. It seems that there was one part of the ancient land - the first part 3
that ever rose from the waters after the earth had flung off the moon and the Old 3
3
3
3
62 3
3
3
3
Ones had seeped down, from the stars - which had come to be shunned as 3
vaguely and namelessly evil. Cities built there had crumbled before their time, 3
and had been found suddenly deserted. Then when the first great earth buckling 3
had convulsed the region in the Comanchian Age, a frightful line of peaks had 3
shot suddenly up amidst the most appalling din and chaos - and earth had 3
received her loftiest and most terrible mountains. 3
3
If the scale of the carvings was correct, these abhorred things must have been 3
much over forty thousand feet high - radically vaster than even the shocking 3
mountains of madness we had crossed. They extended, it appeared, from about 3
Latitude 77°, E. Longitude 70° to Latitude 70°, E. Longitude 100° - less than three 3
hundred miles away from the dead city, so that we would have spied their 3
dreaded summits in the dim western distance had it not been for that vague, 3
opalescent haze. Their northern end must likewise be visible from the long 3
antarctic circle coast line at Queen Mary Land. 3
3
Some of the Old Ones, in the decadent days, had made strange prayers to those 3
mountains - but none ever went near them or dared to guess what lay beyond. 3
No human eye had ever seen them, and as I studied the emotions conveyed in 3
the carvings, I prayed that none ever might. There are protecting hills along the 3
coast beyond them - Queen Mary and Kaiser Wilhelm Lands - and I thank 3
Heaven no one has been able to land and climb those hills. I am not as sceptical 3
about old tales and fears as I used to be, and I do not laugh now at the prehuman 3
sculptor's notion that lightning paused meaningfully now and then at each of the 3
brooding crests, and that an unexplained glow shone from one of those terrible 3
pinnacles all through the long polar night. There may be a very real and very 3
monstrous meaning in the old Pnakotic whispers about Kadath in the Cold 3
Waste. 3
3
But the terrain close at hand was hardly less strange, even if less namelessly 3
accursed. Soon after the founding of the city the great mountain range became 3
the seat of the principal temples, and many carvings showed what grotesque and 3
fantastic towers had pierced the sky where now we saw only the curiously 3
clinging cubes and ramparts. In the course of ages the caves had appeared, and 3
had been shaped into adjuncts of the temples. With the advance of still later 3
epochs, all the limestone veins of the region were hollowed out by ground 3
waters, so that the mountains, the foothills, and the plains below them were a 3
veritable network of connected caverns and galleries. Many graphic sculptures 3
told of explorations deep underground, and of the final discovery of the Stygian 3
sunless sea that lurked at earth's bowels. 3
3
This vast nighted gulf had undoubtedly been worn by the great river which 3
flowed down from the nameless and horrible westward mountains, and which 3
3
3
3
63 3
3
3
3
had formerly turned at the base of the Old Ones' range and flowed beside that 3
chain into the Indian Ocean between Budd and Totten Lands on Wilkes's coast 3
line. Little by little it had eaten away the limestone hill base at its turning, till at 3
last its sapping currents reached the caverns of the ground waters and joined 3
with them in digging a deeper abyss. Finally its whole bulk emptied into the 3
hollow hills and left the old bed toward the ocean dry. Much of the later city as 3
we now found it had been built over that former bed. The Old Ones, 3
understanding what had happened, and exercising their always keen artistic 3
sense, had carved into ornate pylons those headlands of the foothills where the 3
great stream began its descent into eternal darkness. 3
3
This river, once crossed by scores of noble stone bridges, was plainly the one 3
whose extinct course we had seen in our aeroplane survey. Its position in 3
different carvings of the city helped us to orient ourselves to the scene as it had 3
been at various stages of the region's age-long, aeon-dead history, so that we 3
were able to sketch a hasty but careful map of the salient features - squares, 3
important buildings, and the like - for guidance in further explorations. We could 3
soon reconstruct in fancy the whole stupendous thing as it was a million or ten 3
million or fifty million years ago, for the sculptures told us exactly what the 3
buildings and mountains and squares and suburbs and landscape setting and 3
luxuriant Tertiary vegetation had looked like. It must have had a marvelous and 3
mystic beauty, and as I thought of it, I almost forgot the clammy sense of sinister 3
oppression with which the city's inhuman age and massiveness and deadness 3
and remoteness and glacial twilight had choked and weighed on my spirit. Yet 3
according to certain carvings, the denizens of that city had themselves known the 3
clutch of oppressive terror; for there was a somber and recurrent type of scene in 3
which the Old Ones were shown in the act of recoiling affrightedly from some 3
object - never allowed to appear in the design - found in the great river and 3
indicated as having been washed down through waving, vine-draped cycad 3
forests from those horrible westward mountains. 3
3
It was only in the one late-built house with the decadent carvings that we 3
obtained any foreshadowing of the final calamity leading to the city's desertion. 3
Undoubtedly there must have been many sculptures of the same age elsewhere, 3
even allowing for the slackened energies and aspirations of a stressful and 3
uncertain period; indeed, very certain evidence of the existence of others came to 3
us shortly afterward. But this was the first and only set we directly encountered. 3
We meant to look farther later on; but as I have said, immediate conditions 3
dictated another present objective. There would, though, have been a limit - for 3
after all hope of a long future occupancy of the place had perished among the 3
Old Ones, there could not but have been a complete cessation of mural 3
decoration. The ultimate blow, of course, was the coming of the great cold which 3
once held most of the earth in thrall, and which has never departed from the ill- 3
3
3
3
64 3
3
3
3
fated poles - the great cold that, at the world's other extremity, put an end to the 3
fabled lands of Lomar and Hyperborea. 3
3
Just when this tendency began in the antarctic, it would be hard to say in terms 3
of exact years. Nowadays we set the beginning of the general glacial periods at a 3
distance of about five hundred thousand years from the present, but at the poles 3
the terrible scourge must have commenced much earlier. All quantitative 3
estimates are partly guesswork, but it is quite likely that the decadent sculptures 3
were made considerably less than a million years ago, and that the actual 3
desertion of the city was complete long before the conventional opening of the 3
Pleistocene - five hundred thousand years ago - as reckoned in terms of the 3
earth's whole surface. 3
3
In the decadent sculptures there were signs of thinner vegetation everywhere, 3
and of a decreased country life on the part of the Old Ones. Heating devices were 3
shown in the houses, and winter travelers were represented as muffled in 3
protective fabrics. Then we saw a series of cartouches - the continuous band 3
arrangement being frequently interrupted in these late carvings - depicting a 3
constantly growing migration to the nearest refuges of greater warmth - some 3
fleeing to cities under the sea off the far-away coast, and some clambering down 3
through networks of limestone caverns in the hollow hills to the neighboring 3
black abyss of subterrene waters. 3
3
In the end it seems to have been the neighboring abyss which received the 3
greatest colonization. This was partly due, no doubt, to the traditional sacredness 3
of this special region, but may have been more conclusively determined by the 3
opportunities it gave for continuing the use of the great temples on the 3
honeycombed mountains, and for retaining the vast land city as a place of 3
summer residence and base of communication with various mines. The linkage 3
of old and new abodes was made more effective by means of several gradings 3
and improvements along the connecting routes, including the chiseling of 3
numerous direct tunnels from the ancient metropolis to the black abyss - sharply 3
down-pointing tunnels whose mouths we carefully drew, according to our most 3
thoughtful estimates, on the guide map we were compiling. It was obvious that 3
at least two of these tunnels lay within a reasonable exploring distance of where 3
we were - both being on the mountainward edge of the city, one less than a 3
quarter of a mile toward the ancient river course, and the other perhaps twice 3
that distance in the opposite direction. 3
3
The abyss, it seems, had shelving shores of dry land at certain places, but the Old 3
Ones built their new city under water - no doubt because of its greater certainty 3
of uniform warmth. The depth of the hidden sea appears to have been very great, 3
so that the earth's internal heat could ensure its habitability for an indefinite 3
3
3
3
65 3
3
3
3
period. The beings seemed to have had no trouble in adapting themselves to 3
part-time - and eventually, of course, whole-time - residence under water, since 3
they had never allowed their gill systems to atrophy. There were many 3
sculptures which showed how they had always frequently visited their 3
submarine kinsfolk elsewhere, and how they had habitually bathed on the deep 3
bottom of their great river. The darkness of inner earth could likewise have been 3
no deterrent to a race accustomed to long antarctic nights. 3
3
Decadent though their style undoubtedly was, these latest carvings had a truly 3
epic quality where they told of the building of the new city in the cavern sea. The 3
Old Ones had gone about it scientifically - quarrying insoluble rocks from the 3
heart of the honeycombed mountains, and employing expert workers from the 3
nearest submarine city to perform the construction according to the best 3
methods. These workers brought with them all that was necessary to establish 3
the new venture - Shoggoth tissue from which to breed stone lifters and 3
subsequent beasts of burden for the cavern city, and other protoplasmic matter to 3
mold into phosphorescent organisms for lighting purposes. 3
3
At last a mighty metropolis rose on the bottom of that Stygian sea, its 3
architecture much like that of the city above, and its workmanship displaying 3
relatively little decadence because of the precise mathematical element inherent 3
in building operations. The newly bred Shoggoths grew to enormous size and 3
singular intelligence, and were represented as taking and executing orders with 3
marvelous quickness. They seemed to converse with the Old Ones by mimicking 3
their voices - a sort of musical piping over a wide range, if poor Lake's dissection 3
had indicated aright - and to work more from spoken commands than from 3
hypnotic suggestions as in earlier times. They were, however, kept in admirable 3
control. The phosphorescent organisms supplied light With vast effectiveness, 3
and doubtless atoned for the loss of the familiar polar auroras of the outer-world 3
night. 3
3
Art and decoration were pursued, though of course with a certain decadence. 3
The Old Ones seemed to realize this falling off themselves, and in many cases 3
anticipated the policy of Constantine the Great by transplanting especially fine 3
blocks of ancient carving from their land city, just as the emperor, in a similar age 3
of decline, stripped Greece and Asia of their finest art to give his new Byzantine 3
capital greater splendors than its own people could create. That the transfer of 3
sculptured blocks had not been more extensive was doubtless owing to the fact 3
that the land city was not at first wholly abandoned. By the time total 3
abandonment did occur - and it surely must have occurred before the polar 3
Pleistocene was far advanced - the Old Ones had perhaps become satisfied with 3
their decadent art - or had ceased to recognize the superior merit of the older 3
carvings. At any rate, the aeon-silent ruins around us had certainly undergone no 3
3
3
3
66 3
3
3
3
wholesale sculptural denudation, though all the best separate statues, like other 3
movables, had been taken away. 3
3
The decadent cartouches and dadoes telling this story were, as I have said, the 3
latest we could find in our limited search. They left us with a picture of the Old 3
Ones shuttling back and forth betwixt the land city in summer and the sea- 3
cavern city in winter, and sometimes trading with the sea-bottom cities off the 3
antarctic coast. By this time the ultimate doom of the land city must have been 3
recognized, for the sculptures showed many signs of the cold's malign 3
encroachments. Vegetation was declining, and the terrible snows of the winter 3
no longer melted completely even in midsummer. The saunan livestock were 3
nearly all dead, and the mammals were standing it none too well. To keep on 3
with the work of the upper world it had become necessary to adapt some of the 3
amorphous and curiously cold-resistant Shoggoths to land life - a thing the Old 3
Ones had formerly been reluctant to do. The great river was now lifeless, and the 3
upper sea had lost most of its denizens except the seals and whales. All the birds 3
had flown away, save only the great, grotesque penguins. 3
3
What had happened afterward we could only guess. How long had the new sea- 3
cavern city survived? Was it still down there, a stony corpse in eternal blackness? 3
Had the subterranean waters frozen at last? To what fate had the ocean-bottom 3
cities of the outer world been delivered? Had any of the Old Ones shifted north 3
ahead of the creeping ice cap? Existing geology shows no trace of their presence. 3
Had the frightful Mi-Go been still a menace in the outer land world of the north? 3
Could one be sure of what might or might not linger, even to this day, in the 3
lightless and unplumbed abysses of earth's deepest waters? Those things had 3
seemingly been able to withstand any amount of pressure - and men of the sea 3
have fished up curious objects at times. And has the killer-whale theory really 3
explained the savage and mysterious scars on antarctic seals noticed a generation 3
ago by Borchgrevingk? 3
3
The specimens found by poor Lake did not enter into these guesses, for their 3
geologic setting proved them to have lived at what must have been a very early 3
date in the land city's history. They were, according to their location, certainly 3
not less than thirty million years old, and we reflected that in their day the sea- 3
cavern city, and indeed the cavern itself, had had no existence. They would have 3
remembered an older scene, with lush Tertiary vegetation everywhere, a 3
younger land city of flourishing arts around them, and a great river sweeping 3
northward along the base of the mighty mountains toward a far-away tropic 3
ocean. 3
3
And yet we could not help thinking about these specimens - especially about the 3
eight perfect ones that were missing from Lake's hideously ravaged camp. There 3
3
3
3
67 3
3
3
3
was something abnormal about that whole business - the strange things we had 3
tried so hard to lay to somebody's madness - those frightful graves - the amount 3
and nature of the missing material - Gedney - the unearthly toughness of those 3
archaic monstrosities, and the queer vital freaks the sculptures now showed the 3
race to have - Danforth and I had seen a good deal in the last few hours, and 3
were prepared to believe and keep silent about many appalling and incredible 3
secrets of primal nature. 3
3
IX 3
3
I have said that our study of the decadent sculptures brought about a change in 3
our immediate objective. This, of course, had to do with the chiseled avenues to 3
the black inner world, of whose existence we had not known before, but which 3
we were now eager to find and traverse. From the evident scale of the carvings 3
we deduced that a steeply descending walk of about a mile through either of the 3
neighboring tunnels would bring us to the brink of the dizzy, sunless cliffs about 3
the great abyss; down whose sides paths, improved by the Old Ones, led to the 3
rocky shore of the hidden and nighted ocean. To behold this fabulous gulf in 3
stark reality was a lure which seemed impossible of resistance once we knew of 3
the thing - yet we realized we must begin the quest at once if we expected to 3
include it in our present trip. 3
3
It was now 8 P.M., and we did not have enough battery replacements to let our 3
torches burn on forever. We had done so much studying and copying below the 3
glacial level that our battery supply had had at least five hours of nearly 3
continuous use, and despite the special dry cell formula, would obviously be 3
good for only about four more - though by keeping one torch unused, except for 3
especially interesting or difficult places, we might manage to eke out a safe 3
margin beyond that. It would not do to be without a light in these Cyclopean 3
catacombs, hence in order to make the abyss trip we must give up all further 3
mural deciphering. Of course we intended to revisit the place for days and 3
perhaps weeks of intensive study and photography - curiosity having long ago 3
got the better of horror - but just now we must hasten. 3
3
Our supply of trail-blazing paper was far from unlimited, and we were reluctant 3
to sacrifice spare notebooks or sketching paper to augment it, but we did let one 3
large notebook go. If worse came to worst we could resort to rock chipping - and 3
of course it would be possible, even in case of really lost direction, to work up to 3
full daylight by one channel or another if granted sufficient time for plentiful 3
trial and error. So at last we set off eagerly in the indicated direction of the 3
nearest tunnel. 3
3
3
3
68 3
3
3
3
According to the carvings from which we had made our map, the desired tunnel 3
mouth could not be much more than a quarter of a mile from where we stood; 3
the intervening space showing solid-looking buildings quite likely to be 3
penetrable still at a sub-glacial level. The opening itself would be in the basement 3
- on the angle nearest the foothills - of a vast five-pointed structure of evidently 3
public and perhaps ceremonial nature, which we tried to identify from our aerial 3
survey of the ruins. 3
3
No such structure came to our minds as we recalled our flight, hence we 3
concluded that its upper parts had been greatly damaged, or that it had been 3
totally shattered in an ice rift we had noticed. In the latter case the tunnel would 3
probably turn out to be choked, so that we would have to try the next nearest 3
one - the one less than a mile to the north. The intervening river course 3
prevented our trying any of the more southern tunnels on this trip; and indeed, if 3
both of the neighboring ones were choked it was doubtful whether our batteries 3
would warrant an attempt on the next northerly one - about a mile beyond our 3
second choice. 3
3
As we threaded our dim way through the labyrinth with the aid of map and 3
compass - traversing rooms and corridors in every stage of ruin or preservation, 3
clambering up ramps, crossing upper floors and bridges and clambering down 3
again, encountering choked doorways and piles of debris, hastening now and 3
then along finely preserved and uncannily immaculate stretches, taking false 3
leads and retracing our way (in such cases removing the blind paper trail we had 3
left), and once in a while striking the bottom of an open shaft through which 3
daylight poured or trickled down - we were repeatedly tantalized by the 3
sculptured walls along our route. Many must have told tales of immense 3
historical importance, and only the prospect of later visits reconciled us to the 3
need of passing them by. As it was, we slowed down once in a while and turned 3
on our second torch. If we had had more films, we would certainly have paused 3
briefly to photograph certain bas-reliefs, but time-consuming hand-copying was 3
clearly out of the question. 3
3
I come now once more to a place where the temptation to hesitate, or to hint 3
rather than state, is very strong. It is necessary, however, to reveal the rest in 3
order to justify my course in discouraging further exploration. We had wormed 3
our way very close to the computed site of the tunnel's mouth - having crossed a 3
second-story bridge to what seemed plainly the tip of a pointed wall, and 3
descended to a ruinous corridor especially rich in decadently elaborate and 3
apparently ritualistic sculptures of late workmanship - when, shortly before 8:30 3
P.M., Danforth's keen young nostrils gave us the first hint of something unusual. 3
If we had had a dog with us, I suppose we would have been warned before. At 3
first we could not precisely say what was wrong with the formerly crystal-pure 3
3
3
3
69 3
3
3
3
air, but after a few seconds our memories reacted only too definitely. Let me try 3
to state the thing without flinching. There was an odor - and that odor was 3
vaguely, subtly, and unmistakably akin to what had nauseated us upon opening 3
the insane grave of the horror poor Lake had dissected. 3
3
Of course the revelation was not as clearly cut at the time as it sounds now. There 3
were several conceivable explanations, and we did a good deal of indecisive 3
whispering. Most important of all, we did not retreat without further 3
investigation; for having come this far, we were loath to be balked by anything 3
short of certain disaster. Anyway, what we must have suspected was altogether 3
too wild to believe. Such things did not happen in any normal world. It was 3
probably sheer irrational instinct which made us dim our single torch - tempted 3
no longer by the decadent and sinister sculptures that leered menacingly from 3
the oppressive walls - and which softened our progress to a cautious tiptoeing 3
and crawling over the increasingly littered floor and heaps of debris. 3
3
Danforth's eyes as well as nose proved better than mine, for it was likewise he 3
who first noticed the queer aspect of the debris after we had passed many half- 3
choked arches leading to chambers and corridors on the ground level. It did not 3
look quite as it ought after countless thousands of years of desertion, and when 3
we cautiously turned on more light we saw that a kind of swath seemed to have 3
been lately tracked through it. The irregular nature of the litter precluded any 3
definite marks, but in the smoother places there were suggestions of the 3
dragging of heavy objects. Once we thought there was a hint of parallel tracks as 3
if of runners. This was what made us pause again. 3
3
It was during that pause that we caught - simultaneously this time - the other 3
odor ahead. Paradoxically, it was both a less frightful and more frightful odor - 3
less frightful intrinsically, but infinitely appalling in this place under the known 3
circumstances - unless, of course, Gedney - for the odor was the plain and 3
familiar one of common petrol - every-day gasoline. 3
3
Our motivation after that is something I will leave to psychologists. We knew 3
now that some terrible extension of the camp horrors must have crawled into this 3
nighted burial place of the aeons, hence could not doubt any longer the existence 3
of nameless conditions - present or at least recent just ahead. Yet in the end we 3
did let sheer burning curiosity-or anxiety-or autohypnotism - or vague thoughts 3
of responsibility toward Gedney - or what not - drive us on. Danforth whispered 3
again of the print he thought he had seen at the alley turning in the ruins above; 3
and of the faint musical piping - potentially of tremendous significance in the 3
light of Lake's dissection report, despite its close resemblance to the cave-mouth 3
echoes of the windy peaks - which he thought he had shortly afterward half 3
heard from unknown depths below. I, in my turn, whispered of how the camp 3
3
3
3
70 3
3
3
3
was left - of what had disappeared, and of how the madness of a lone survivor 3
might have conceived the inconceivable - a wild trip across the monstrous 3
mountains and a descent into the unknown, primal masonry - But we could not 3
convince each other, or even ourselves, of anything definite. We had turned off 3
all light as we stood still, and vaguely noticed that a trace of deeply filtered 3
upper day kept the blackness from being absolute. Having automatically begun 3
to move ahead, we guided ourselves by occasional flashes from our torch. The 3
disturbed debris formed an impression we could not shake off, and the smell of 3
gasoline grew stronger. More and more ruin met our eyes and hampered our 3
feet, until very soon we saw that the forward way was about to cease. We had 3
been all too correct in our pessimistic guess about that rift glimpsed from the air. 3
Our tunnel quest was a blind one, and we were not even going to be able to 3
reach the basement out of which the abyssward aperture opened. 3
3
The torch, flashing over the grotesquely carved walls of the blocked corridor in 3
which we stood, showed several doorways in various states of obstruction; and 3
from one of them the gasoline odor-quite submerging that other hint of odor - 3
came with especial distinctness. As we looked more steadily, we saw that 3
beyond a doubt there had been a slight and recent clearing away of debris from 3
that particular opening. Whatever the lurking horror might be, we believed the 3
direct avenue toward it was now plainly manifest. I do not think anyone will 3
wonder that we waited an appreciable time before making any further motion. 3
3
And yet, when we did venture inside that black arch, our first impression was 3
one of anticlimax. For amidst the littered expanse of that sculptured Crypt - a 3
perfect cube with sides of about twenty feet - there remained no recent object of 3
instantly discernible size; so that we looked instinctively, though in vain, for a 3
farther doorway. In another moment, however, Danforth's sharp vision had 3
descried a place where the floor debris had been disturbed; and we turned on 3
both torches full strength. Though what we saw in that light was actually simple 3
and trifling, I am none the less reluctant to tell of it because of what it implied. It 3
was a rough leveling of the debris, upon which several small objects lay 3
carelessly scattered, and at one corner of which a considerable amount of 3
gasoline must have been spilled lately enough to leave a strong odor even at this 3
extreme superplateau altitude. In other words, it could not be other than a sort of 3
camp - a camp made by questing beings who, like us, had been turned back by 3
the unexpectedly choked way to the abyss. 3
3
Let me be plain. The scattered objects were, so far as substance was concerned, 3
all from Lake's camp; and consisted of tin cans as queerly opened as those we 3
had seen at that ravaged place, many spent matches, three illustrated books more 3
or less curiously smudged, an empty ink bottle with its pictorial and 3
instructional carton, a broken fountain pen, some oddly snipped fragments of fur 3
3
3
3
71 3
3
3
3
and tent cloth, a used electric battery with circular of directions, a folder that 3
came with our type of tent heater, and a sprinkling of crumpled papers. It was all 3
bad enough but when we smoothed out the papers and looked at what was on 3
them, we felt we had come to the worst. We had found certain inexplicably 3
blotted papers at the camp which might have prepared us, yet the effect of the 3
sight down there in the prehuman vaults of a nightmare city was almost too 3
much to bear. 3
3
A mad Gedney might have made the groups of dots in imitation of those found 3
on the greenish soapstones, just as the dots on those insane five-pointed grave 3
mounds might have been made; and he might conceivably have prepared rough, 3
hasty sketches - varying in their accuracy or lack of it - which outlined the 3
neighboring parts of the city and traced the way from a circularly represented 3
place outside our previous route - a place we identified as a great cylindrical 3
tower in the carvings and as a vast circular gulf glimpsed in our aerial survey - to 3
the present five-pointed structure and the tunnel mouth therein. 3
3
He might, I repeat, have prepared such sketches; for those before us were quite 3
obviously compiled, as our own had been, from late sculptures somewhere in the 3
glacial labyrinth, though not from the ones which we had seen and used. But 3
what the art-blind bungler could never have done was to execute those sketches 3
in a strange and assured technique perhaps superior, despite haste and 3
carelessness, to any of the decadent carvings from which they were taken - the 3
characteristic and unmistakable technique of the Old Ones themselves in the 3
dead city's heyday. 3
3
There are those who will say Danforth and I were utterly mad not to flee for our 3
lives after that; since our conclusions were now - notwithstanding their wildness 3
3
- completely fixed, and of a nature I need not even mention to those who have 3
read my account as far as this. Perhaps we were mad - for have I not said those 3
horrible peaks were mountains of madness? But I think I can detect something of 3
the same spirit - albeit in a less extreme form - in the men who stalk deadly 3
beasts through African jungles to photograph them or study their habits. Half 3
paralyzed with terror though we were, there was nevertheless fanned within us a 3
blazing flame of awe and curiosity which triumphed in the end. 3
3
Of course we did not mean to face that - or those - which we knew had been 3
there, but we felt that they must be gone by now. They would by this time have 3
found the other neighboring entrance to the abyss, and have passed within, to 3
whatever night-black fragments of the past might await them in the ultimate gulf 3
3
- the ultimate gulf they had never seen. Or if that entrance, too, was blocked, they 3
would have gone on to the north seeking another. They were, we remembered, 3
partly independent of light. 3
3
3
3
72 3
3
3
3
Looking back to that moment, I can scarcely recall just what precise form our 3
new emotions took - just what change of immediate objective it was that so 3
sharpened our sense of expectancy. We certainly did not mean to face what we 3
feared - yet I will not deny that we may have had a lurking, unconscious wish to 3
spy certain things from some hidden vantage point. Probably we had not given 3
up our zeal to glimpse the abyss itself, though there was interposed a new goal 3
in the form of that great circular place shown on the crumpled sketches we had 3
found. We had at once recognized it as a monstrous cylindrical tower figuring in 3
the very earliest carvings, but appearing only as a prodigious round aperture 3
from above. Something about the impressiveness of its rendering, even in these 3
hasty diagrams, made us think that its subglacial levels must still form a feature 3
of peculiar importance. Perhaps it embodied architectural marvels as yet 3
unencountered by us. It was certainly of incredible age according to the 3
sculptures in which it figured - being indeed among the first things built in the 3
city. Its carvings, if preserved, could not but be highly significant. Moreover, it 3
might form a good present link with the upper world - a shorter route than the 3
one we were so carefully blazing, and probably that by which those others had 3
descended. 3
3
At any rate, the thing we did was to study the terrible sketches - which quite 3
perfectly confirmed our own - and start back over the indicated course to the 3
circular place; the course which our nameless predecessors must have traversed 3
twice before us. The other neighboring gate to the abyss would lie beyond that. I 3
need not speak of our journey - during which we continued to leave an 3
economical trail of paper - for it was precisely the same in kind as that by which 3
we had reached the cul-de-sac; except that it tended to adhere more closely to the 3
ground level and even descend to basement corridors. Every now and then we 3
could trace certain disturbing marks in the debris or litter underfoot; and after 3
we had passed outside the radius of the gasoline scent, we were again faintly 3
conscious - spasmodically - of that more hideous and more persistent scent. After 3
the way had branched from our former course, we sometimes gave the rays of 3
our single torch a furtive sweep along the walls; noting in almost every case the 3
well-nigh omnipresent sculptures, which indeed seem to have formed a main 3
aesthetic outlet for the Old Ones. 3
3
About 9:30 P.M., while traversing a long, vaulted corridor whose increasingly 3
glaciated floor seemed somewhat below the ground level and whose roof grew 3
lower as we advanced, we began to see strong daylight ahead and were able to 3
turn off our torch. It appeared that we were coming to the vast circular place, 3
and that our distance from the upper air could not be very great. The corridor 3
ended in an arch surprisingly low for these megalithic ruins, but we could see 3
much through it even before we emerged. Beyond there stretched a prodigious 3
round space - fully two hundred feet in diameter - strewn with debris and 3
3
3
3
73 3
3
3
3
containing many choked archways corresponding to the one we were about to 3
cross. The walls were - in available spaces - boldly sculptured into a spiral band 3
of heroic proportions; and displayed, despite the destructive weathering caused 3
by the openness of the spot, an artistic splendor far beyond anything we had 3
encountered before. The littered floor was quite heavily glaciated, and we 3
fancied that the true bottom lay at a considerably lower depth. 3
3
But the salient object of the place was the titanic stone ramp which, eluding the 3
archways by a sharp turn outward into the open floor, wound spirally up the 3
stupendous cylindrical wall like an inside counterpart of those once climbing 3
outside the monstrous towers or ziggurats of antique Babylon. Only the rapidity 3
of our flight, and the perspective which confounded the descent with the tower's 3
inner wall, had prevented our noticing this feature from the air, and thus caused 3
us to seek another avenue to the subglacial level. Pabodie might have been able 3
to tell what sort of engineering held it in place, but Danforth and I could merely 3
admire and marvel. We could see mighty stone corbels and pillars here and 3
there, but what we saw seemed inadequate to the function performed. The thing 3
was excellently preserved up to the present top of the tower - a highly 3
remarkable circumstance in view of its exposure - and its shelter had done much 3
to protect the bizarre and disturbing cosmic sculptures on the walls. 3
3
As we stepped out into the awesome half daylight of this monstrous cylinder 3
bottom - fifty million years old, and without doubt the most primally ancient 3
structure ever to meet our eyes - we saw that the ramp- traversed sides stretched 3
dizzily up to a height of fully sixty feet. This, we recalled from our aerial survey, 3
meant an outside glaciation of some forty feet; since the yawning gulf we had 3
seen from the plane had been at the top of an approximately twenty-foot mound 3
of crumbled masonry, somewhat sheltered for three-fourths of its circumference 3
by the massive curving walls of a line of higher ruins. According to the 3
sculptures, the original tower had stood in the center of an immense circular 3
plaza, and had been perhaps five hundred or six hundred feet high, with tiers of 3
horizontal disks near the top, and a row of needlelike spires along the upper rim. 3
Most of the masonry had obviously toppled outward rather than inward - a 3
fortunate happening, since otherwise the ramp might have been shattered and 3
the whole interior choked. As it was, the ramp showed sad battering; whilst the 3
choking was such that all the archways at the bottom seemed to have been 3
recently cleared. 3
3
It took us only a moment to conclude that this was indeed the route by which 3
those others had descended, and that this would be the logical route for our own 3
ascent despite the long trail of paper we had left elsewhere. The tower's mouth 3
was no farther from the foothills and our waiting plane than was the great 3
terraced building we had entered, and any further subglacial exploration we 3
3
3
3
74 3
3
3
3
might make on this trip would He in this general region. Oddly, we were still 3
thinking about possible later trips - even after all we had seen and guessed. Then, 3
as we picked our way cautiously over the debris of the great floor, there came a 3
sight which for the time excluded all other matters. 3
3
It was the neatly huddled array of three sledges in that farther angle of the 3
ramp's lower and outward- projecting course which had hitherto been screened 3
from our view. There they were - the three sledges missing from Lake's camp - 3
shaken by a hard usage which must have included forcible dragging along great 3
reaches of snowless masonry and debris, as well as much hand portage over 3
utterly unnavigable places. They were carefully and intelligently packed and 3
strapped, and contained things memorably familiar enough: the gasoline stove, 3
fuel cans, instrument cases, provision tins, tarpaulins obviously bulging with 3
books, and some bulging with less obvious contents - everything derived from 3
Lake's equipment. 3
3
Alter what we had found in that other room, we were in a measure prepared for 3
this encounter. The really great shock came when we stepped over and undid 3
one tarpaulin whose outlines had peculiarly disquieted us. It seems that others as 3
well as Lake had been interested in collecting typical specimens; for there were 3
two here, both stiffly frozen, perfectly preserved, patched with adhesive plaster 3
where some wounds around the neck had occurred, and wrapped with care to 3
prevent further damage. They were the bodies of young Gedney and the missing 3
dog. 3
3
X 3
3
Many people will probably judge us callous as well as mad for thinking about 3
the northward tunnel and the abyss so soon after our somber discovery, and I am 3
not prepared to say that we would have immediately revived such thoughts but 3
for a specific circumstance which broke in upon us and set up a whole new train 3
of speculations. We had replaced the tarpaulin over poor Gedney and were 3
standing in a kind of mute bewilderment when the sounds finally reached our 3
consciousness - the first sounds we had heard since descending out of the open 3
where the mountain wind whined faintly from its unearthly heights. Well- 3
known and mundane though they were, their presence in this remote world of 3
death was more unexpected and unnerving than any grotesque or fabulous tones 3
could possibly have been - since they gave a fresh upsetting to all our notions of 3
cosmic harmony. 3
3
Had it been some trace of that bizarre musical piping over a wide range which 3
Lake's dissection report had led us to expect in those others - and which, indeed, 3
our overwrought fancies had been reading into every wind howl we had heard 3
3
3
3
7b 3
3
3
3
since coining on the camp horror - it would have had a kind of helHsh congruity 3
with the aeon-dead region around us. A voice from other epochs belongs in a 3
graveyard of other epochs. As it was, however, the noise shattered all our 3
profoundly seated adjustments - all our tacit acceptance of the inner antarctic as a 3
waste utterly and irrevocably void of every vestige of normal life. What we heard 3
was not the fabulous note of any buried blasphemy of elder earth from whose 3
supernal toughness an age-denied polar sun had evoked a monstrous response. 3
Instead, it was a thing so mockingly normal and so unerringly familiarized by 3
our sea days off Victoria Land and our camp days at McMurdo Sound that we 3
shuddered to think of it here, where such things ought not to be. To be brief - it 3
was simply the raucous squawking of a penguin. 3
3
The muffled sound floated from subglacial recesses nearly opposite to the 3
corridor whence we had come - regions manifestly in the direction of that other 3
tunnel to the vast abyss. The presence of a living water bird in such a direction - 3
in a world whose surface was one of age-long and uniform lifelessness - could 3
lead to only one conclusion; hence our first thought was to verify the objective 3
reality of the sound. It was, indeed, repeated, and seemed at times to come from 3
more than one throat. Seeking its source, we entered an archway from which 3
much debris had been cleared; resuming our trail blazing - with an added paper 3
supply taken with curious repugnance from one of the tarpaulin bundles on the 3
sledges - when we left daylight behind. 3
3
As the glaciated floor gave place to a litter of detritus, we plainly discerned some 3
curious, dragging tracks; and once Danforth found a distinct print of a sort 3
whose description would be only too superfluous. The course indicated by the 3
penguin cries was precisely what our map and compass prescribed as an 3
approach to the more northerly tunnel mouth, and we were glad to find that a 3
bridgeless thoroughfare on the ground and basement levels seemed open. The 3
tunnel, according to the chart, ought to start from the basement of a large 3
pyramidal structure which we seemed vaguely to recall from our aerial survey as 3
remarkably well-preserved. Along our path the single torch showed a customary 3
profusion of carvings, but we did not pause to examine any of these. 3
3
Suddenly a bulky white shape loomed up ahead of us, and we flashed on the 3
second torch. It is odd how wholly this new quest had turned our minds from 3
earlier fears of what might lurk near. Those other ones, having left their supplies 3
in the great circular place, must have planned to return after their scouting trip 3
toward or into the abyss; yet we had now discarded all caution concerning them 3
as completely as if they had never existed. This white, waddling thing was fully 3
six feet high, yet we seemed to realize at once that it was not one of those others. 3
They were larger and dark, and, according to the sculptures, their motion over 3
land surfaces was a swift, assured matter despite the queerness of their sea-born 3
3
3
3
76 3
3
3
3
tentacle equipment. But to say that the white thing did not profoundly frighten 3
us would be vain. We were indeed clutched for an instant by primitive dread 3
almost sharper than the worst of our reasoned fears regarding those others. Then 3
came a flash of anticlimax as the white shape sidled into a lateral archway to our 3
left to join two others of its kind which had summoned it in raucous tones. For it 3
was only a penguin - albeit of a huge, unknown species larger than the greatest 3
of the known king penguins, and monstrous in its combined albinism and virtual 3
eyelessness. 3
3
When we had followed the thing into the archway and turned both our torches 3
on the indifferent and unheeding group of three, we saw that they were all 3
eyeless albinos of the same unknown and gigantic species. Their size reminded 3
us of some of the archaic penguins depicted in the Old Ones' sculptures, and it 3
did not take us long to conclude that they were descended from the same stock- 3
undoubtedly surviving through a retreat to some warmer inner region whose 3
perpetual blackness had destroyed their pigmentation and atrophied their eyes 3
to mere useless slits. That their present habitat was the vast abyss we sought, was 3
not for a moment to be doubted; and this evidence of the gulf's continued 3
warmth and habitability filled us with the most curious and subtly perturbing 3
fancies. 3
3
We wondered, too, what had caused these three birds to venture out of their 3
usual domain. The state and silence of the great dead city made it clear that it 3
had at no time been an habitual seasonal rookery, whilst the manifest 3
indifference of the trio to our presence made it seem odd that any passing party 3
of those others should have startled them. Was it possible that those others had 3
taken some aggressive action or t- ried to increase their meat supply? We 3
doubted whether that pungent odor which the dogs had hated could cause an 3
equal antipathy in these penguins, since their ancestors had obviously lived on 3
excellent terms with the Old Ones - an amicable relationship which must have 3
survived in the abyss below as long as any of the Old Ones remained. Regretting 3
- in a flare-up of the old spirit of pure science - that we could not photograph 3
these anomalous creatures, we shortly left them to their squawking and pushed 3
on toward the abyss whose openness was now so positively proved to us, and 3
whose exact direction occasional penguin tracks made clear. 3
3
Not long afterward a steep descent in a long, low, doorless, and peculiarly 3
sculptureless corridor led us to believe that we were approaching the tunnel 3
mouth at last. We had passed two more penguins, and heard others immediately 3
ahead. Then the corridor ended in a prodigious open space which made us gasp 3
involuntarily - a perfect inverted hemisphere, obviously deep underground; fully 3
a hundred feet in diameter and fifty feet high, with low archways opening 3
around all parts of the circumference but one, and that one yawning cavernously 3
3
3
3
n 3
3
3
3
with a black, arched aperture which broke the symmetry of the vauh to a height 3
of nearly fifteen feet. It was the entrance to the great abyss. 3
3
In this vast hemisphere, whose concave roof was impressively though 3
decadently carved to a likeness of the primordial celestial dome, a few albino 3
penguins waddled - aliens there, but indifferent and unseeing. The black tunnel 3
yawned indefinitely off at a steep, descending grade, its aperture adorned with 3
grotesquely chiseled jambs and lintel. From that cryptical mouth we fancied a 3
current of slightly warmer air, and perhaps even a suspicion of vapor proceeded; 3
and we wondered what living entities other than penguins the limitless void 3
below, and the contiguous honeycombings of the land and the titan mountains, 3
might conceal. We wondered, too, whether the trace of mountaintop smoke at 3
first suspected by poor Lake, as well as the odd haze we had ourselves perceived 3
around the rampart-crowned peak, might not be caused by the tortuous- 3
channeled rising of some such vapor from the unfathomed regions of earth's 3
core. 3
3
Entering the tunnel, we saw that its outline was - at least at the start - about 3
fifteen feet each way - sides, floor, and arched roof composed of the usual 3
megalithic masonry. The sides were sparsely decorated with cartouches of 3
conventional designs in a late, decadent style; and all the construction and 3
carving were marvelously well-preserved. The floor was quite clear, except for a 3
slight detritus bearing outgoing penguin tracks and the inward tracks of these 3
others. The farther one advanced, the warmer it became; so that we were soon 3
unbuttoning our heavy garments. We wondered whether there were any actually 3
igneous manifestations below, and whether the waters of that sunless sea were 3
hot. Alter a short distance the masonry gave place to solid rock, though the 3
tunnel kept the same proportions and presented the same aspect of carved 3
regularity. Occasionally its varying grade became so steep that grooves were cut 3
in the floor. Several times we noted the mouths of small lateral galleries not 3
recorded in our diagrams; none of them such as to complicate the problem of our 3
return, and all of them welcome as possible refuges in case we met unwelcome 3
entities on their way back from the abyss. The nameless scent of such things was 3
very distinct. Doubtless it was suicidally foolish to venture into that tunnel under 3
the known conditions, but the lure of the unplumbed is stronger in certain 3
persons than most suspect - indeed, it was just such a lure which had brought us 3
to this unearthly polar waste in the first place. We saw several penguins as we 3
passed along, and speculated on the distance we would have to traverse. The 3
carvings had led us to expect a steep downhill walk of about a mile to the abyss, 3
but our previous wanderings had shown us that matters of scale were not wholly 3
to be depended on. 3
3
3
3
78 3
3
3
3
Alter about a quarter of a mile that nameless scent became greatly accentuated, 3
and we kept very careful track of the various lateral openings we passed. There 3
was no visible vapor as at the mouth, but this was doubtless due to the lack of 3
contrasting cooler air. The temperature was rapidly ascending, and we were not 3
surprised to come upon a careless heap of material shudderingly familiar to us. It 3
was composed of furs and tent cloth taken from Lake's camp, and we did not 3
pause to study the bizarre forms into which the fabrics had been slashed. Slightly 3
beyond this point we noticed a decided increase in the size and number of the 3
side galleries, and concluded that the densely honeycombed region beneath the 3
higher foothills must now have been reached. The nameless scent was now 3
curiously mixed with another and scarcely less offensive odor - of what nature 3
we could not guess, though we thought of decaying organisms and perhaps 3
unknown subterranean fungi. Then came a startling expansion of the tunnel for 3
which the carvings had not prepared us - a broadening and rising into a lofty, 3
natural-looking elliptical cavern with a level floor, some seventy-five feet long 3
and fifty broad, and with many immense side passages leading away into 3
cryptical darkness. 3
3
Though this cavern was natural in appearance, an inspection with both torches 3
suggested that it had been formed by the artificial destruction of several walls 3
between adjacent honey combings. The walls were rough, and the high, vaulted 3
roof was thick with stalactites; but the solid rock floor had been smoothed off, 3
and was free from all debris, detritus, or even dust to a positively abnormal 3
extent. Except for the avenue through which we had come, this was true of the 3
floors of all the great galleries opening off from it; and the singularity of the 3
condition was such as to set us vainly puzzling. The curious new fetor which had 3
supplemented the nameless scent was excessively pungent here; so much so that 3
it destroyed all trace of the other. Something about this whole place, with its 3
polished and almost glistening floor, struck us as more vaguely baffling and 3
horrible than any of the monstrous things we had previously encountered. 3
3
The regularity of the passage immediately ahead, as well as the larger proportion 3
of penguin-droppings there, prevented all confusion as to the right course amidst 3
this plethora of equally great cave mouths. Nevertheless we resolved to resume 3
our paper trailblazing if any further complexity should develop; for dust tracks, 3
of course, could no longer be expected. Upon resuming our direct progress we 3
cast a beam of torchlight over the tunnel walls - and stopped short in amazement 3
at the supremely radical change which had come over the carvings in this part of 3
the passage. We realized, of course, the great decadence of the Old Ones' 3
sculpture at the time of the tunneling, and had indeed noticed the inferior 3
workmanship of the arabesques in the stretches behind us. But now, in this 3
deeper section beyond the cavern, there was a sudden difference wholly 3
transcending explanation - a difference in basic nature as well as in mere quality. 3
3
3
3
79 3
3
3
3
and involving so profound and calamitous a degradation of skill that nothing in 3
the hitherto observed rate of decline could have led one to expect it. 3
3
This new and degenerate work was coarse, bold, and wholly lacking in delicacy 3
of detail. It was countersunk with exaggerated depth in bands following the 3
same general line as the sparse car-touches of the earlier sections, but the height 3
of the reliefs did not reach the level of the general surface. Danforth had the idea 3
that it was a second carving - a sort of palimpsest formed after the obliteration of 3
a previous design. In nature it was wholly decorative and conventional, and 3
consisted of crude spirals and angles roughly following the quintile 3
mathematical tradition of the Old Ones, yet seemingly more like a parody than a 3
perpetuation of that tradition. We could not get it out of our minds that some 3
subtly but profoundly alien element had been added to the aesthetic feeling 3
behind the technique - an alien element, Danforth guessed, that was responsible 3
for the laborious substitution. It was like, yet disturbingly unlike, what we had 3
come to recognize as the Old Ones' art; and I was persistently reminded of such 3
hybrid things as the ungainly Palmyrene sculptures fashioned in the Roman 3
manner. That others had recently noticed this belt of carving was hinted by the 3
presence of a used flashlight battery on the floor in front of one of the most 3
characteristic cartouches. 3
3
Since we could not afford to spend any considerable time in study, we resumed 3
our advance after a cursory look; though frequently casting beams over the walls 3
to see if any further decorative changes developed. Nothing of the sort was 3
perceived, though the carvings were in places rather sparse because of the 3
numerous mouths of smooth-floored lateral tunnels. We saw and heard fewer 3
penguins, but thought we caught a vague suspicion of an infinitely distant 3
chorus of them somewhere deep within the earth. The new and inexplicable odor 3
was abominably strong, and we could detect scarcely a sign of that other 3
nameless scent. Puffs of visible vapor ahead bespoke increasing contrasts in 3
temperature, and the relative nearness of the sunless sea cliffs of the great abyss. 3
Then, quite unexpectedly, we saw certain obstructions on the polished floor 3
ahead - obstructions which were quite definitely not penguins - and turned on 3
our second torch after making sure that the objects were quite stationary. 3

Still another time have I come to a place where it is very difficult to proceed. I 3
ought to be hardened by this stage; but there are some experiences and 3
intimations which scar too deeply to permit of healing, and leave only such an 3
added sensitiveness that memory reinspires all the original horror. We saw, as I 3
have said, certain obstructions on the polished floor ahead; and I may add that 3
our nostrils were assailed almost simultaneously by a very curious intensification 3
3
3
3
80 3
3
3
3
of the strange prevailing fetor, now quite plainly mixed with the nameless stench 3
of those others which had gone before. The light of the second torch left no doubt 3
of what the obstructions were, and we dared approach them only because we 3
could see, even from a distance, that they were quite as past all harming power 3
as had been the six similar specimens unearthed from the monstrous star- 3
mounded graves at poor Lake's camp. 3
3
They were, indeed, as lacking - in completeness as most of those we had 3
unearthed - though it grew plain from the thick, dark green pool gathering 3
around them that their incompleteness was of infinitely greater recency. There 3
seemed to be only four of them, whereas Lake's bulletins would have suggested 3
no less than eight as forming the group which had preceded us. To find them in 3
this state was wholly unexpected, and we wondered what sort of monstrous 3
struggle had occurred down here in the dark. 3
3
Penguins, attacked in a body, retaliate savagely with their beaks, and our ears 3
now made certain the existence of a rookery far beyond. Had those others 3
disturbed such a place and aroused murderous pursuit? The obstructions did not 3
suggest it, for penguins' beaks against the tough tissues Lake had dissected could 3
hardly account for the terrible damage our approaching glance was beginning to 3
make out. Besides, the huge blind birds we had seen appeared to be singularly 3
peaceful. 3
3
Had there, then, been a struggle among those others, and were the absent four 3
responsible? If so, where were they? Were they close at hand and likely to form 3
an immediate menace to us? We glanced anxiously at some of the smooth- 3
floored lateral passages as we continued our slow and frankly reluctant 3
approach. Whatever the conflict was, it had clearly been that which had 3
frightened the penguins into their unaccustomed wandering. It must, then, have 3
arisen near that faintly heard rookery in the incalculable gulf beyond, since there 3
were no signs that any birds had normally dwelt here. Perhaps, we reflected, 3
there had been a hideous running fight, with the weaker party seeking to get 3
back to the cached sledges when their pursuers finished them. One could picture 3
the demoniac fray between namelessly monstrous entities as it surged out of the 3
black abyss with great clouds of frantic penguins squawking and scurrying 3
ahead. 3
3
I say that we approached those sprawling and incomplete obstructions slowly 3
and reluctantly. Would to Heaven we had never approached them at all, but had 3
run back at top speed out of that blasphemous tunnel with the greasily smooth 3
floors and the degenerate murals aping and mocking the things they had 3
superseded-run back, before we had seen what we did see, and before our minds 3
were burned with something which will never let us breathe easily again! 3
3
3
3
81 3
3
3
3
Both of our torches were turned on the prostrate objects, so that we soon reaHzed 3
the dominant factor in their incompleteness. Mauled, compressed, twisted, and 3
ruptured as they were, their chief common injury was total decapitation. From 3
each one the tentacled starfish head had been removed; and as we drew near we 3
saw that the manner of removal looked more like some hellish tearing or suction 3
than like any ordinary form of cleavage. Their noisome dark-green ichor formed 3
a large, spreading pOOl; but its stench was half overshadowed by the newer and 3
stranger stench, here more pungent than at any other point along our route. Only 3
when we had come very close to the sprawling obstructions could we trace that 3
second, unexplainable fetor to any immediate source - and the instant we did so 3
Danforth, remembering certain very vivid sculptures of the Old Ones' history in 3
the Permian Age one hundred and fifty million years ago, gave vent to a nerve- 3
tortured cry which echoed hysterically through that vaulted and archaic passage 3
with the evil, palimpsest carvings. 3
3
I came only just short of echoing his cry myself; for I had seen those primal 3
sculptures, too, and had shudderingly admired the way the nameless artist had 3
suggested that hideous slime coating found on certain incomplete and prostrate 3
Old Ones - those whom the frightful Shoggoths had characteristically slain and 3
sucked to a ghastly headlessness in the great war of resubjugation. They were 3
infamous, nightmare sculptures even when telling of age-old, bygone things; for 3
Shoggoths and their work ought not to be seen by human beings or portrayed by 3
any beings. The mad author of the Necronomicon had nervously tried to swear 3
that none had been bred on this planet, and that only drugged dreamers had 3
even conceived them. Formless protoplasm able to mock and reflect all forms 3
and organs and processes - viscous agglutinations of bubbling cells - rubbery 3
fifteen-foot spheroids infinitely plastic and ductile - slaves of suggestion, builders 3
of cities - more and more sullen, more and more intelligent, more and more 3
amphibious, more and more imitative! Great God! What madness made even 3
those blasphemous Old Ones willing to use and carve such things? 3
3
And now, when Danforth and I saw the freshly glistening and reflectively 3
iridescent black slime which clung thickly to those headless bodies and stank 3
obscenely with that new, unknown odor whose cause only a diseased fancy 3
could envisage - clung to those bodies and sparkled less voluminously on a 3
smooth part of the accursedly resculptured wall in a series of grouped dots - we 3
understood the quality of cosmic fear to its uttermost depths. It was not fear of 3
those four missing others - for all too well did we suspect they would do no 3
harm again. Poor devils! Alter all, they were not evil things of their kind. They 3
were the men of another age and another order of being. Nature had played a 3
hellish jest on them - as it will on any others that human madness, callousness, or 3
cruelty may hereafter dig up in that hideously dead or sleeping polar waste - and 3
this was their tragic homecoming. They had not been even savages-for what 3
3
3
3
82 3
3
3
3
indeed had they done? That awful awakening in the cold of an unknown epoch - 3
perhaps an attack by the furry, frantically barking quadrupeds, and a dazed 3
defense against them and the equally frantic white simians with the queer 3
wrappings and paraphernalia ... poor Lake, poor Gedney... and poor Old Ones! 3
Scientists to the last - what had they done that we would not have done in their 3
place? God, what intelligence and persistence! What a facing of the incredible, 3
just as those carven kinsmen and forbears had faced things only a little less 3
incredible! Radiates, vegetables, monstrosities, star spawn - whatever they had 3
been, they were men! 3
3
They had crossed the icy peaks on whose templed slopes they had once 3
worshipped and roamed among the tree ferns. They had found their dead city 3
brooding under its curse, and had read its carven latter days as we had done. 3
They had tried to reach their living fellows in fabled depths of blackness they 3
had never seen - and what had they found? All this flashed in unison through 3
the thoughts of Danforth and me as we looked from those headless, slime-coated 3
shapes to the loathsome palimpsest sculptures and the diabolical dot groups of 3
fresh slime on the wall beside them - looked and understood what must have 3
triumphed and survived down there in the Cyclopean water city of that nighted, 3
penguin-fringed abyss, whence even now a sinister curling mist had begun to 3
belch pallidly as if in answer to Danforth's hysterical scream. 3
3
The shock of recognizing that monstrous slime and headlessness had frozen us 3
into mute, motionless statues, and it is only through later conversations that we 3
have learned of the complete identity of our thoughts at that moment. It seemed 3
aeons that we stood there, but actually it could not have been more than ten or 3
fifteen seconds. That hateful, pallid mist curled forward as if veritably driven by 3
some remoter advancing bulk-and then came a sound which upset much of what 3
we had just decided, and in so doing broke the spell and enabled us to run like 3
mad past squawking, confused penguins over our former trail back to the city, 3
along ice-sunken megalithic corridors to the great open circle, and up that 3
archaic spiral ramp in a frenzied, automatic plunge for the sane outer air and 3
light of day. 3
3
The new sound, as I have intimated, upset much that we had decided; because it 3
was what poor Lake's dissection had led us to attribute to those we had judged 3
dead. It was, Danforth later told me, precisely what he had caught in infinitely 3
muffled form when at that spot beyond the alley corner above the glacial level; 3
and it certainly had a shocking resemblance to the wind pipings we had both 3
heard around the lofty mountain caves. At the risk of seeming puerile I will add 3
another thing, too, if only because of the surprising way Danforth's impressions 3
chimed with mine. Of course common reading is what prepared us both to make 3
the interpretation, though Danforth has hinted at queer notions about 3
3
3
3
83 3
3
3
3
unsuspected and forbidden sources to which Poe may have had access when 3
writing his Arthur Gordon Pym a century ago. It will be remembered that in that 3
fantastic tale there is a word of unknown but terrible and prodigious significance 3
connected with the antarctic and screamed eternally by the gigantic spectrally 3
snowy birds of that malign region's core. "Tekeli-li! Tekeli-li!" That, I may admit, 3
is exactly what we thought we heard conveyed by that sudden sound behind the 3
advancing white mist-that insidious musical piping over a singularly wide 3
range. 3
3
We were in full flight before three notes or syllables had been uttered, though we 3
knew that the swiftness of the Old Ones would enable any scream-roused and 3
pursuing survivor of the slaughter to overtake us in a moment if it really wished 3
to do so. We had a vague hope, however, that nonaggressive conduct and a 3
display of kindred reason might cause such a being to spare us in case of capture, 3
if only from scientific curiosity. Alter all, if such an one had nothing to fear for 3
itself, it would have no motive in harming us. Concealment being futile at this 3
juncture, we used our torch for a running glance behind, and perceived that the 3
mist was thinning. Would we see, at last, a complete and living specimen of 3
those others? Again came that insidious musical piping- "Tekeli-li! Tekeli-li!" 3
Then, noting that we were actually gaining on our pursuer, it occurred to us that 3
the entity might be wounded. We could take no chances, however, since it was 3
very obviously approaching in answer to Danforth's scream, rather than in flight 3
from any other entity. The timing was too close to admit of doubt. Of the 3
whereabouts of that less conceivable and less mentionable nightmare - that fetid, 3
unglimpsed mountain of slime-spewing protoplasm whose race had conquered 3
the abyss and sent land pioneers to recarve and squirm through the burrows of 3
the hills - we could form no guess; and it cost us a genuine pang to leave this 3
probably crippled Old One-perhaps a lone survivor - to the peril of recapture 3
and a nameless fate. 3
3
Thank Heaven we did not slacken our run. The curling mist had thickened again, 3
and was driving ahead with increased speed; whilst the straying penguins in our 3
rear were squawking and screaming and displaying signs of a panic really 3
surprising in view of their relatively minor confusion when we had passed them. 3
Once more came that sinister, wide-ranged piping - "Tekeli-li! Tekeli-li!" We had 3
been wrong. The thing was not wounded, but had merely paused on 3
encountering the bodies of its fallen kindred and the hellish slime inscription 3
above them. We could never know what that demon message was - but those 3
burials at Lake's camp had shown how much importance the beings attached to 3
their dead. Our recklessly used torch now revealed ahead of us the large open 3
cavern where various ways converged, and we were glad to be leaving those 3
morbid palimpsest sculptures - almost felt even when scarcely seen-behind. 3
Another thought which the advent of the cave inspired was the possibility of 3
3
3
3
84 3
3
3
3
losing our pursuer at this bewildering focus of large galleries. There were several 3
of the blind albino penguins in the open space, and it seemed clear that their fear 3
of the oncoming entity was extreme to the point of unaccountability. If at that 3
point we dimmed our torch to the very lowest limit of traveling need, keeping it 3
strictly in front of us, the frightened squawking motions of the huge birds in the 3
mist might muffle our footfalls, screen our true course, and somehow set up a 3
false lead. Amidst the churning, spiraling fog, the littered and unglistening floor 3
of the main tunnel beyond this point, as differing from the other morbidly 3
polished burrows, could hardly form a highly distinguishing feature; even, so far 3
as we could conjecture, for those indicated special senses which made the Old 3
Ones partly, though imperfectly, independent of light in emergencies. In fact, we 3
were somewhat apprehensive lest we go astray ourselves in our haste. For we 3
had, of course, decided to keep straight on toward the dead city; since the 3
consequences of loss in those unknown foothill honeycombings would be 3
unthinkable. 3
3
The fact that we survived and emerged is sufficient proof that the thing did take 3
a wrong gallery whilst we providentially hit on the right one. The penguins 3
alone could not have saved us, but in conjunction with the mist they seem to 3
have done so. Only a benign fate kept the curling vapors thick enough at the 3
right moment, for they were constantly shifting and threatening to vanish. 3
Indeed, they did lift for a second just before we emerged from the nauseously 3
resculptured tunnel into the cave; so that we actually caught one first and only 3
half glimpse of the oncoming entity as we cast a final, desperately fearful glance 3
backward before dimming the torch and mixing with the penguins in the hope of 3
dodging pursuit. If the fate which screened us was benign, that which gave us 3
the half glimpse was infinitely the opposite; for to that flash of semivision can be 3
traced a full half of the horror which has ever since haunted us. 3
3
Our exact motive in looking back again was perhaps no more than the 3
immemorial instinct of the pursued to gauge the nature and course of its 3
pursuer; or perhaps it was an automatic attempt to answer a subconscious 3
question raised by one of our senses. In the midst of our flight, with all our 3
faculties centered on the problem of escape, we were in no condition to observe 3
and analyze details; yet even so, our latent brain cells must have wondered at the 3
message brought them by our nostrils. Alterward we realized what it was-that 3
our retreat from the fetid slime coating on those headless obstructions, and the 3
coincident approach of the pursuing entity, had not brought us the exchange of 3
stenches which logic called for. In the neighborhood of the prostrate things that 3
new and lately unexplainable fetor had been wholly dominant; but by this time it 3
ought to have largely given place to the nameless stench associated with those 3
others. This it had not done - for instead, the newer and less bearable smell was 3
3
3
3
85 3
3
3
3
now virtually undiluted, and growing more and more poisonously insistent each 3
second. 3
3
So we glanced back simultaneously, it would appear; though no doubt the 3
incipient motion of one prompted the imitation of the other. As we did so we 3
flashed both torches full strength at the momentarily thinned mist; either from 3
sheer primitive anxiety to see all we could, or in a less primitive but equally 3
unconscious effort to dazzle the entity before we dimmed our light and dodged 3
among the penguins of the labyrinth center ahead. Unhappy act! Not Orpheus 3
himself, or Lot's wife, paid much more dearly for a backward glance. And again 3
came that shocking, wide-ranged piping - "Tekeli-li! Tekeli-li!" 3
3
I might as well be frank - even if I cannot bear to be quite direct - in stating what 3
we saw; though at the time we felt that it was not to be admitted even to each 3
other. The words reaching the reader can never even suggest the awfulness of 3
the sight itself. It crippled our consciousness so completely that I wonder we had 3
the residual sense to dim our torches as planned, and to strike the right tunnel 3
toward the dead city. Instinct alone must have carried us through - perhaps 3
better than reason could have done; though if that was what saved us, we paid a 3
high price. Of reason we certainly had little enough left. 3
3
Danforth was totally unstrung, and the first thing I remember of the rest of the 3
journey was hearing him lightheadedly chant an hysterical formula in which I 3
alone of mankind could have found anything but insane irrelevance. It 3
reverberated in falsetto echoes among the squawks of the penguins; reverberated 3
through the vaultings ahead, and-thank God-through the now empty vaultings 3
behind. He could not have begun it at once - else we would not have been alive 3
and blindly racing. I shudder to think of what a shade of difference in his 3
nervous reactions might have brought. 3
3
"South Station Under - Washington Under - Park Street Under-Kendall - Central 3
- Harvard - " The poor fellow was chanting the familiar stations of the Boston- 3
Cambridge tunnel that burrowed through our peaceful native soil thousands of 3
miles away in New England, yet to me the ritual had neither irrelevance nor 3
home feeling. It had only horror, because I knew unerringly the monstrous, 3
nefandous analogy that had suggested it. We had expected, upon looking back, 3
to see a terrible and incredible moving entity if the mists were thin enough; but 3
of that entity we had formed a clear idea. What we did see - for the mists were 3
indeed all too malignly thinned - was something altogether different, and 3
immeasurably more hideous and detestable. It was the utter, objective 3
embodiment of the fantastic novelist's "thing that should not be"; and its nearest 3
comprehensible analogue is a vast, onrushing subway train as one sees it from a 3
station platform - the great black front looming colossally out of infinite 3
3
3
3
86 3
3
3
3
subterranean distance, constellated with strangely colored lights and filling the 3
prodigious burrow as a piston fills a cylinder. 3
3
But we were not on a station platform. We were on the track ahead as the 3
nightmare, plastic column of fetid black iridescence oozed tightly onward 3
through its fifteen-foot sinus, gathering unholy speed and driving before it a 3
spiral, rethickening cloud of the pallid abyss vapor. It was a terrible, 3
indescribable thing vaster than any subway train - a shapeless congeries of 3
protoplasmic bubbles, faintly self-luminous, and with myriads of temporary eyes 3
forming and un-forming as pustules of greenish light all over the tunnel-filling 3
front that bore down upon us, crushing the frantic penguins and slithering over 3
the glistening floor that it and its kind had swept so evilly free of all litter. Still 3
came that eldritch, mocking cry- "Tekeli-li! Tekeli-li!" and at last we remembered 3
that the demoniac Shoggoths - given life, thought, and plastic organ patterns 3
solely by the Old Ones, and having no language save that which the dot groups 3
expressed - had likewise no voice save the imitated accents of their bygone 3
masters. 3
3
XII 3
3
Danforth and I have recollections of emerging into the great sculptured 3
hemisphere and of threading our back trail through the Cyclopean rooms and 3
corridors of the dead city; yet these are purely dream fragments involving no 3
memory of volition, details, or physical exertion. It was as if we floated in a 3
nebulous world or dimension without time, causation, or orientation. The gray 3
half-daylight of the vast circular space sobered us somewhat; but we did not go 3
near those cached sledges or look again at poor Gedney and the dog. They have a 3
strange and titanic mausoleum, and I hope the end of this planet will find them 3
still undisturbed. 3
3
It was while struggling up the colossal spiral incline that we first felt the terrible 3
fatigue and short breath which our race through the thin plateau air had 3
produced; but not even fear of collapse could make us pause before reaching the 3
normal outer realm of sun and sky. There was something vaguely appropriate 3
about our departure from those buried epochs; for as we wound our panting 3
way up the sixty-foot cylinder of primal masonry, we glimpsed beside us a 3
continuous procession of heroic sculptures in the dead race's early and 3
undecayed technique - a farewell from the Old Ones, written fifty million years 3
ago. 3
3
Finally scrambling out at the top, we found ourselves on a great mound of 3
tumbled blocks, with the curved walls of higher stonework rising westward, and 3
the brooding peaks of the great mountains showing beyond the more crumbled 3
3
3
3
87 3
3
3
3
structures toward the east. The low antarctic sun of midnight peered redly from 3
the southern horizon through rifts in the jagged ruins, and the terrible age and 3
deadness of the nightmare city seemed all the starker by contrast with such 3
relatively known and accustomed things as the features of the polar landscape. 3
The sky above was a churning and opalescent mass of tenuous ice-vapors, and 3
the cold clutched at our vitals. Wearily resting the outfit-bags to which we had 3
instinctively clung throughout our desperate flight, we rebuttoned our heavy 3
garments for the stumbling climb down the mound and the walk through the 3
aeon-old stone maze to the foothills where our aeroplane waited. Of what had 3
set us fleeing from that darkness of earth's secret and archaic gulfs we said 3
nothing at all. 3
3
In less than a quarter of an hour we had found the steep grade to the foothills-the 3
probable ancient terrace - by which we had descended, and could see the dark 3
bulk of our great plane amidst the sparse ruins on the rising slope ahead. 3
Halfway uphill toward our goal we paused for a momentary breathing spell, and 3
turned to look again at the fantastic tangle of incredible stone shapes below us- 3
once more outlined mystically against an unknown west. As we did so we saw 3
that the sky beyond had lost its morning haziness; the restless ice-vapors having 3
moved up to the zenith, where their mocking outlines seemed on the point of 3
settling into some bizarre pattern which they feared to make quite definite or 3
conclusive. 3
3
There now lay revealed on the ultimate white horizon behind the grotesque city 3
a dim, elfin line of pinnacled violet whose needle-pointed heights loomed 3
dreamlike against the beckoning rose color of the western sky. Up toward this 3
shimmering rim sloped the ancient table-land, the depressed course of the 3
bygone river traversing it as an irregular ribbon of shadow. For a second we 3
gasped in admiration of the scene's unearthly cosmic beauty, and then vague 3
horror began to creep into our souls. For this far violet line could be nothing else 3
than the terrible mountains of the forbidden land - highest of earth's peaks and 3
focus of earth's evil; harborers of nameless horrors and Archaean secrets; 3
shunned and prayed to by those who feared to carve their meaning; untrodden 3
by any living thing on earth, but visited by the sinister lightnings and sending 3
strange beams across the plains in the polar night - beyond doubt the unknown 3
archetype of that dreaded Kadath in the Cold Waste beyond abhorrent Leng, 3
whereof primal legends hint evasively. 3
3
If the sculptured maps and pictures in that prehuman city had told truly, these 3
cryptic violet mountains could not be much less than three hundred miles away; 3
yet none the less sharply did their dim elfin essence appear above that remote 3
and snowy rim, like the serrated edge of a monstrous alien planet about to rise 3
into unaccustomed heavens. Their height, then, must have been tremendous 3
3
3
3
88 3
3
3
3
beyond all comparison - carrying them up into tenuous atmospheric strata 3
peopled only by such gaseous wraiths as rash flyers have barely lived to whisper 3
of after unexplainable falls. Looking at them, I thought nervously of certain 3
sculptured hints of what the great bygone river had washed down into the city 3
from their accursed slopes - and wondered how much sense and how much folly 3
had lain in the fears of those Old Ones who carved them so reticently. I recalled 3
how their northerly end must come near the coast at Queen Mary Land, where 3
even at that moment Sir Douglas Mawson's expedition was doubtless working 3
less than a thousand miles away; and hoped that no evil fate would give Sir 3
Douglas and his men a glimpse of what might lie beyond the protecting coastal 3
range. Such thoughts formed a measure of my overwrought condition at the time 3
- and Danforth seemed to be even worse. 3
3
Yet long before we had passed the great star-shaped ruin and reached our plane, 3
our fears had become transferred to the lesser but vast-enough range whose 3
recrossing lay ahead of us. From these foothills the black, ruin-crusted slopes 3
reared up starkly and hideously against the east, again reminding us of those 3
strange Asian paintings of Nicholas Roerich; and when we thought of the 3
frightful amorphous entities that might have pushed their fetidly squirming way 3
even to the topmost hollow pinnacles, we could not face without panic the 3
prospect of again sailing by those suggestive skyward cave mouths where the 3
wind made sounds like an evil musical piping over a wide range. To make 3
matters worse, we saw distinct traces of local mist around several of the 3
summits-as poor Lake must have done when he made that early mistake about 3
volcanism - and thought shiveringly of that kindred mist from which we had just 3
escaped; of that, and of the blasphemous, horror-fostering abyss whence all such 3
vapors came. 3
3
All was well with the plane, and we clumsily hauled on our heavy flying furs. 3
Danforth got the engine started without trouble, and we made a very smooth 3
take-off over the nightmare city. Below us the primal Cyclopean masonry spread 3
out as it had done when first we saw it, and we began rising and turning to test 3
the wind for our crossing through the pass. At a very high level there must have 3
been great disturbance, since the ice-dust clouds of the zenith were doing all 3
sorts of fantastic things; but at twenty-four thousand feet, the height we needed 3
for the pass, we found navigation quite practicable. As we drew close to the 3
jutting peaks the wind's strange piping again became manifest, and I could see 3
Danforth's hands trembling at the controls. Rank amateur that I was, I thought at 3
that moment that I might be a better navigator than he in effecting the dangerous 3
crossing between pinnacles; and when I made motions to change seats and take 3
over his duties he did not protest. I tried to keep all my skill and self-possession 3
about me, and stared at the sector of reddish farther sky betwixt the walls of the 3
pass-resolutely refusing to pay attention to the puffs of mountain-top vapor, and 3
3
3
3
89 3
3
3
3
wishing that I had wax-stopped ears hke Ulysses' men off the Siren's coast to 3
keep that disturbing windpiping from my consciousness. 3
3
But Danforth, released from his piloting and keyed up to a dangerous nervous 3
pitch, could not keep quiet. I felt him turning and wriggling about as he looked 3
back at the terrible receding city, ahead at the cave- riddled, cube-barnacled 3
peaks, sidewise at the bleak sea of snowy, rampart-strewn foothills, and upward 3
at the seething, grotesquely clouded sky. It was then, just as I was trying to steer 3
safely through the pass, that his mad shrieking brought us so close to disaster by 3
shattering my tight hold on myself and causing me to fumble helplessly with the 3
controls for a moment. A second afterward my resolution triumphed and we 3
made the crossing safely - yet I am afraid that Danforth will never be -the same 3
again. 3
3
I have said that Danforth refused to tell me what final horror made him scream 3
out so insanely-a horror which, I feel sadly sure, is mainly responsible for his 3
present breakdown. We had snatches of shouted conversation above the wind's 3
piping and the engine's buzzing as we reached the safe side of the range and 3
swooped slowly down toward the camp, but that had mostly to do with the 3
pledges of secrecy we had made as we prepared to leave the nightmare city. 3
Certain things, we had agreed, were not for people to know and discuss lightly- 3
and I would not speak of them now but for the need of heading off that 3
Starkweather-Moore Expedition, and others, at any cost. It is absolutely 3
necessary, for the peace and safety of mankind, that some of earth's dark, dead 3
corners and unplumbed depths be let alone; lest sleeping abnormalities wake to 3
resurgent life, and blasphemously surviving nightmares squirm and splash out 3
of their black lairs to newer and wider conquests. 3
3
All that Danforth has ever hinted is that the final horror was a mirage. It was not, 3
he declares, anything connected with the cubes and caves of those echoing, 3
vaporous, wormily-honeycombed mountains of madness which we crossed; but 3
a single fantastic, demoniac glimpse, among the churning zenith clouds, of what 3
lay back of those other violet westward mountains which the Old Ones had 3
shunned and feared. It is very probable that the thing was a sheer delusion born 3
of the previous stresses we had passed through, and of the actual though 3
unrecognized mirage of the dead transmontane city experienced near Lake's 3
camp the day before; but it was so real to Danforth that he suffers from it still. 3
3
He has on rare occasions whispered disjointed and irresponsible things about 3

and other bizarre conceptions; but when he is fully himself he repudiates all this 3
and attributes it to his curious and macabre reading of earlier years. Danforth, 3
indeed, is known to be among the few who have ever dared go completely 3
through that worm-riddled copy of the Necronomicon kept under lock and key 3
in the college library. 3

The higher sky, as we crossed the range, was surely vaporous and disturbed 3
enough; and although I did not see the zenith, I can well imagine that its swirls 3
of ice dust may have taken strange forms. Imagination, knowing how vividly 3
distant scenes can sometimes be reflected, refracted, and magnified by such 3
layers of restless cloud, might easily have supplied the rest - and, of course, 3

When age fell upon the world, and wonder went out of the minds of men; when 3
grey cities reared to smoky skies tall towers grim and ugly, in whose shadow 3
none might dream of the sun or of Spring's flowering meads; when learning 3
stripped the Earth of her mantle of beauty and poets sang no more of twisted 3
phantoms seen with bleared and inward looking eyes; when these things had 3
come to pass, and childish hopes had gone forever, there was a man who 3
traveled out of life on a quest into spaces whither the world's dreams had fled. 3
3
Of the name and abode of this man little is written, for they were of the waking 3
world only; yet it is said that both were obscure. It is enough to say that he dwelt 3
in a city of high walls where sterile twilight reigned, that he toiled all day among 3
shadow and turmoil, coming home at evening to a room whose one window 3
opened not to open fields and groves but on to a dim court where other windows 3
stared in dull despair. From that casement one might see only walls and 3
windows, except sometimes when one leaned so far out and peered at the small 3
stars that passed. And because mere walls and windows must soon drive a man 3
to madness who dreams and reads much, the dweller in that roOm used night 3
after night to lean out and peer aloft to glimpse some fragment of things beyond 3
the waking world and the tall cities. After years he began to call the slow sailing 3
stars by name, and to follow them in fancy when they glided regretfully out of 3
sight; till at length his vision opened to many secret vistas whose existance no 3
common eye suspected. And one night a mighty gulf was bridged, and the 3
dream haunted skies swelled down to the lonely watcher's window to merge 3
with the close air of his room and to make him a part of their fabulous wonder. 3
3
There came to that room wild streams of violet midnight glittering with dust of 3
gold, vortices of dust and fire, swirling out of the ultimate spaces and heavy 3
perfumes from beyond the worlds. Opiate oceans poured there, litten by suns 3
that the eye may never behold and having in their whirlpools strange dolphins 3
and sea-nymphs of unrememberable depths. Noiseless infinity eddied around 3
the dreamer and wafted him away without touching the body that leaned stiffly 3
from the lonely window; and for days not counted in men's calandars the tides 3
of far spheres that bore him gently to join the course of other cycles that tenderly 3
left him sleeping on a green sunrise shore, a green shore fragrant with lotus 3
blossums and starred by red camalotes... 3

I have often wondered if the majority of mankind ever pause to reflect upon the 3
occasionally titanic significance of dreams, and of the obscure world to which 3
they belong. Whilst the greater number of our nocturnal visions are perhaps no 3
more than faint and fantastic reflections of our waking experiences - Freud to the 3
contrary with his puerile symbolism - there are still a certain remainder whose 3
immundane and ethereal character permit of no ordinary interpretation, and 3
whose vaguely exciting and disquieting effect suggests possible minute glimpses 3
into a sphere of mental existence no less important than physical life, yet 3
separated from that life by an all but impassable barrier. From my experience I 3
cannot doubt but that man, when lost to terrestrial consciousness, is indeed 3
sojourning in another and uncorporeal life of far different nature from the life we 3
know, and of which only the slightest and most indistinct memories linger after 3
waking. From those blurred and fragmentary memories we may infer much, yet 3
prove little. We may guess that in dreams life, matter, and vitality, as the earth 3
knows such things, are not necessarily constant; and that time and space do not 3
exist as our waking selves comprehend them. Sometimes I believe that this less 3
material life is our truer life, and that our vain presence on the terraqueous globe 3
is itself the secondary or merely virtual phenomenon. 3
3
It was from a youthful revery filled with speculations of this sort that I arose one 3
afternoon in the winter of 1900-01, when to the state psychopathic institution in 3
which I served as an intern was brought the man whose case has ever since 3
haunted me so unceasingly. His name, as given on the records, was Joe Slater, or 3
Slaader, and his appearance was that of the typical denizen of the Catskill 3
Mountain region; one of those strange, repellent scions of a primitive Colonial 3
peasant stock whose isolation for nearly three centuries in the hilly fastnesses of 3
a little-traveled countryside has caused them to sink to a kind of barbaric 3
degeneracy, rather than advance with their more fortunately placed brethren of 3
the thickly settled districts. Among these odd folk, who correspond exactly to the 3
decadent element of "white trash" in the South, law and morals are non-existent; 3
and their general mental status is probably below that of any other section of 3
native American people. 3
3
Joe Slater, who came to the institution in the vigilant custody of four state 3
policemen, and who was described as a highly dangerous character, certainly 3
presented no evidence of his perilous disposition when I first beheld him. 3
3
3
3
93 3
3
3
3
Though well above the middle stature, and of somewhat brawny frame, he was 3
given an absurd appearance of harmless stupidity by the pale, sleepy blueness of 3
his small watery eyes, the scantiness of his neglected and never-shaven growth 3
of yellow beard, and the listless drooping of his heavy nether lip. His age was 3
unknown, since among his kind neither family records nor permanent family ties 3
exist; but from the baldness of his head in front, and from the decayed condition 3
of his teeth, the head surgeon wrote him down as a man of about forty. 3
3
From the medical and court documents we learned all that could be gathered of 3
his case: this man, a vagabond, hunter and trapper, had always been strange in 3
the eyes of his primitive associates. He had habitually slept at night beyond the 3
ordinary time, and upon waking would often talk of unknown things in a 3
manner so bizarre as to inspire fear even in the hearts of an unimaginative 3
populace. Not that his form of language was at all unusual, for he never spoke 3
save in the debased patois of his environment; but the tone and tenor of his 3
utterances were of such mysterious wildness, that none might listen without 3
apprehension. He himself was generally as terrified and baffled as his auditors, 3
and within an hour after awakening would forget all that he had said, or at least 3
all that had caused him to say what he did; relapsing into a bovine, half-amiable 3
normality like that of the other hilldwellers. 3
3
As Slater grew older, it appeared, his matutinal aberrations had gradually 3
increased in frequency and violence; till about a month before his arrival at the 3
institution had occurred the shocking tragedy which caused his arrest by the 3
authorities. One day near noon, after a profound sleep begun in a whiskey 3
debauch at about five of the previous afternoon, the man had roused himself 3
most suddenly, with ululations so horrible and unearthly that they brought 3
several neighbors to his cabin - a filthy sty where he dwelt with a family as 3
indescribable as himself. Rushing out into the snow, he had flung his arms aloft 3
and commenced a series of leaps directly upward in the air; the while shouting 3
his determination to reach some "big, big cabin with brightness in the roof and 3
walls and floor and the loud queer music far away". As two men of moderate 3
size sought to restrain him, he had struggled with maniacal force and fury, 3
screaming of his desire and need to find and kill a certain "thing that shines and 3
shakes and laughs". At length, after temporarily felling one of his detainers with 3
a sudden blow, he had flung himself upon the other in a demoniac ecstasy of 3
blood-thirstiness, shrieking fiendishly that he would "jump high in the air and 3
burn his way through anything that stopped him". 3
3
Family and neighbors had now fled in a panic, and when the more courageous of 3
them returned. Slater was gone, leaving behind an unrecognizable pulp-like 3
thing that had been a living man but an hour before. None of the mountaineers 3
had dared to pursue him, and it is likely that they would have welcomed his 3
3
3
3
94 3
3
3
3
death from the cold; but when several mornings later they heard his screams 3
from a distant ravine they realized that he had somehow managed to survive, 3
and that his removal in one way or another would be necessary. Then had 3
followed an armed searching-party, whose purpose (whatever it may have been 3
originally) became that of a sheriff's posse after one of the seldom popular state 3
troopers had by accident observed, then questioned, and finally joined the 3
seekers. 3
3
On the third day Slater was found unconscious in the hollow of a tree, and taken 3
to the nearest jail, where alienists from Albany examined him as soon as his 3
senses returned. To them he told a simple story. He had, he said, gone to sleep 3
one afternoon about sundown after drinking much liquor. He had awakened to 3
find himself standing bloody-handed in the snow before his cabin, the mangled 3
corpse of his neighbor Peter Slader at his feet. Horrified, he had taken to the 3
woods in a vague effort to escape from the scene of what must have been his 3
crime. Beyond these things he seemed to know nothing, nor could the expert 3
questioning of his interrogators bring out a single additional fact. 3
3
That night Slater slept quietly, and the next morning he awakened with no 3
singular feature save a certain alteration of expression. Doctor Barnard, who had 3
been watching the patient, thought he noticed in the pale blue eyes a certain 3
gleam of peculiar quality, and in the flaccid lips an all but imperceptible 3
tightening, as if of intelligent determination. But when questioned. Slater 3
relapsed into the habitual vacancy of the mountaineer, and only reiterated what 3
he had said on the preceding day. 3
3
On the third morning occurred the first of the man's mental attacks. After some 3
show of uneasiness in sleep, he burst forth into a frenzy so powerful that the 3
combined efforts of four men were needed to bind him in a straightjacket. The 3
alienists listened with keen attention to his words, since their curiosity had been 3
aroused to a high pitch by the suggestive yet mostly conflicting and incoherent 3
stories of his family and neighbors. Slater raved for upward of fifteen minutes, 3
babbling in his backwoods dialect of green edifices of light, oceans of space, 3
strange music, and shadowy mountains and valleys. But most of all did he dwell 3
upon some mysterious blazing entity that shook and laughed and mocked at 3
him. This vast, vague personality seemed to have done him a terrible wrong, and 3
to kill it in triumphant revenge was his paramount desire. In order to reach it, he 3
said, he would soar through abysses of emptiness, burning every obstacle that 3
stood in his way. Thus ran his discourse, until with the greatest suddenness he 3
ceased. The fire of madness died from his eyes, and in dull wonder he looked at 3
his questioners and asked why he was bound. Dr. Barnard unbuckled the leather 3
harness and did not restore it till night, when he succeeded in persuading Slater 3
3
3
3
95 3
3
3
3
to don it of his own volition, for his own good. The man had now admitted that 3
he sometimes talked queerly, though he knew not why. 3
3
Within a week two more attacks appeared, but from them the doctors learned 3
little. On the source of Slater's visions they speculated at length, for since he 3
could neither read nor write, and had apparently never heard a legend or fairy- 3
tale, his gorgeous imagery was quite inexplicable. That it could not come from 3
any known myth or romance was made especially clear by the fact that the 3
unfortunate lunatic expressed himself only in his own simple manner. He raved 3
of things he did not understand and could not interpret; things which he claimed 3
to have experienced, but which he could not have learned through any normal or 3
connected narration. The alienists soon agreed that abnormal dreams were the 3
foundation of the trouble; dreams whose vividness could for a time completely 3
dominate the waking mind of this basically inferior man. With due formality 3
Slater was tried for murder, acquitted on the ground of insanity, and committed 3
to the institution wherein I held so humble a post. 3
3
I have said that I am a constant speculator concerning dream-life, and from this 3
you may judge of the eagerness with which I applied myself to the study of the 3
new patient as soon as I had fully ascertained the facts of his case. He seemed to 3
sense a certain friendliness in me, born no doubt of the interest I could not 3
conceal, and the gentle manner in which I questioned him. Not that he ever 3
recognized me during his attacks, when I hung breathlessly upon his chaotic but 3
cosmic word-pictures; but he knew me in his quiet hours, when he would sit by 3
his barred window weaving baskets of straw and willow, and perhaps pining for 3
the mountain freedom he could never again enjoy. His family never called to see 3
him; probably it had found another temporary head, after the manner of 3
decadent mountain folk. 3
3
By degrees I commenced to feel an overwhelming wonder at the mad and 3
fantastic conceptions of Joe Slater. The man himself was pitiably inferior in 3
mentality and language alike; but his glowing, titanic visions, though described 3
in a barbarous disjointed jargon, were assuredly things which only a superior or 3
even exceptional brain could conceive How, I often asked myself, could the 3
stolid imagination of a Catskill degenerate conjure up sights whose very 3
possession argued a lurking spark of genius? How could any backwoods dullard 3
have gained so much as an idea of those glittering realms of supernal radiance 3
and space about which Slater ranted in his furious delirium? More and more I 3
inclined to the belief that in the pitiful personality who cringed before me lay the 3
disordered nucleus of something beyond my comprehension; something 3
infinitely beyond the comprehension of my more experienced but less 3
imaginative medical and scientific colleagues. 3
3
3
3
96 3
3
3
3
And yet I could extract nothing definite from the man. The sum of all my 3
investigation was, that in a kind of semi-corporeal dream-life Slater wandered or 3
floated through resplendent and prodigious valleys, meadows, gardens, cities, 3
and palaces of light, in a region unbounded and unknown to man; that there he 3
was no peasant or degenerate, but a creature of importance and vivid life, 3
moving proudly and dominantly, and checked only by a certain deadly enemy, 3
who seemed to be a being of visible yet ethereal structure, and who did not 3
appear to be of human shape, since Slater never referred to it as a man, or as 3
aught save a thing. This thing had done Slater some hideous but unnamed 3
wrong, which the maniac (if maniac he were) yearned to avenge. 3
3
From the manner in which Slater alluded to their dealings, I judged that he and 3
the luminous thing had met on equal terms; that in his dream existence the man 3
was himself a luminous thing of the same race as his enemy. This impression 3
was sustained by his frequent references to flying through space and burning all 3
that impeded his progress. Yet these conceptions were formulated in rustic 3
words wholly inadequate to convey them, a circumstance which drove me to the 3
conclusion that if a dream world indeed existed, oral language was not its 3
medium for the transmission of thought. Could it be that the dream soul 3
inhabiting this inferior body was desperately struggling to speak things which 3
the simple and halting tongue of dullness could not utter? Could it be that I was 3
face to face with intellectual emanations which would explain the mystery if I 3
could but learn to discover and read them? I did not tell the older physicians of 3
these things, for middle age is skeptical, cynical, and disinclined to accept new 3
ideas. Besides, the head of the institution had but lately warned me in his 3
paternal way that I was overworking; that my mind needed a rest. 3
3
It had long been my belief that human thought consists basically of atomic or 3
molecular motion, convertible into ether waves or radiant energy like heat, light 3
and electricity. This belief had early led me to contemplate the possibility of 3
telepathy or mental communication by means of suitable apparatus, and I had in 3
my college days prepared a set of transmitting and receiving instruments 3
somewhat similar to the cumbrous devices employed in wireless telegraphy at 3
that crude, pre-radio period. These I had tested with a fellow-student, but 3
achieving no result, had soon packed them away with other scientific odds and 3
ends for possible future use. 3
3
Now, in my intense desire to probe into the dream-life of Joe Slater, I sought 3
these instruments again, and spent several days in repairing them for action. 3
When they were complete once more I missed no opportunity for their trial. At 3
each outburst of Slater's violence, I would fit the transmitter to his forehead and 3
the receiver to my own, constantly making delicate adjustments for various 3
hypothetical wave- lengths of intellectual energy. I had but little notion of how 3
3
3
3
97 3
3
3
3
the thought-impressions would, if successfully conveyed, arouse an intelligent 3
response in my brain, but I felt certain that I could detect and interpret them. 3
Accordingly I continued my experiments, though informing no one of their 3
nature. 3
3
It was on the twenty-first of February, 1901, that the thing occurred. As I look 3
back across the years I realize how unreal it seems, and sometimes wonder if old 3
Doctor Fenton was not right when he charged it all to my excited imagination. I 3
recall that he listened with great kindness and patience when I told him, but 3
afterward gave me a nerve-powder and arranged for the half-year's vacation on 3
which I departed the next week. 3
3
That fateful night I was wildly agitated and perturbed, for despite the excellent 3
care he had received, Joe Slater was unmistakably dying. Perhaps it was his 3
mountain freedom that he missed, or perhaps the turmoil in his brain had grown 3
too acute for his rather sluggish physique; but at all events the flame of vitality 3
flickered low in the decadent body. He was drowsy near the end, and as 3
darkness fell he dropped off into a troubled sleep. 3
3
I did not strap on the straightjacket as was customary when he slept, since I saw 3
that he was too feeble to be dangerous, even if he woke in mental disorder once 3
more before passing away. But I did place upon his head and mine the two ends 3
of my cosmic "radio", hoping against hope for a first and last message from the 3
dream world in the brief time remaining. In the cell with us was one nurse, a 3
mediocre fellow who did not understand the purpose of the apparatus, or think 3
to inquire into my course. As the hours wore on I saw his head droop 3
awkwardly in sleep, but I did not disturb him. I myself, lulled by the rhythmical 3
breathing of the healthy and the dying man, must have nodded a little later. 3
3
The sound of weird lyric melody was what aroused me. Chords, vibrations, and 3
harmonic ecstasies echoed passionately on every hand, while on my ravished 3
sight burst the stupendous spectacle ultimate beauty. Walls, columns, and 3
architraves of living fire blazed effulgently around the spot where I seemed to 3
float in air, extending upward to an infinitely high vaulted dome of indescribable 3
splendor. Blending with this display of palatial magnificence, or rather, 3
supplanting it at times in kaleidoscopic rotation, were glimpses of wide plains 3
and graceful valleys, high mountains and inviting grottoes, covered with every 3
lovely attribute of scenery which my delighted eyes could conceive of, yet 3
formed wholly of some glowing, ethereal plastic entity, which in consistency 3
partook as much of spirit as of matter. As I gazed, I perceived that my own brain 3
held the key to these enchanting metamorphoses; for each vista which appeared 3
to me was the one my changing mind most wished to behold. Amidst this 3
elysian realm I dwelt not as a stranger, for each sight and sound was familiar to 3
3
3
3
98 3
3
3
3
me; just as it had been for uncounted eons of eternity before, and would be for 3
like eternities to come. 3
3
Then the resplendent aura of my brother of light drew near and held colloquy 3
with me, soul to soul, with silent and perfect interchange of thought. The hour 3
was one of approaching triumph, for was not my fellow-being escaping at last 3
from a degrading periodic bondage; escaping forever, and preparing to follow 3
the accursed oppressor even unto the uttermost fields of ether, that upon it might 3
be wrought a flaming cosmic vengeance which would shake the spheres? We 3
floated thus for a little time, when I perceived a slight blurring and fading of the 3
objects around us, as though some force were recalling me to earth - where I least 3
wished to go. The form near me seemed to feel a change also, for it gradually 3
brought its discourse toward a conclusion, and itself prepared to quit the scene, 3
fading from my sight at a rate somewhat less rapid than that of the other objects. 3
A few more thoughts were exchanged, and I knew that the luminous one and I 3
were being recalled to bondage, though for my brother of light it would be the 3
last time. The sorry planet shell being well-nigh spent, in less than an hour my 3
fellow would be free to pursue the oppressor along the Milky Way and past the 3
hither stars to the very confines of infinity. 3
3
A well-defined shock separates my final impression of the fading scene of light 3
from my sudden and somewhat shamefaced awakening and straightening up in 3
my chair as I saw the dying figure on the couch move hesitantly. Joe Slater was 3
indeed awaking, though probably for the last time. As I looked more closely, I 3
saw that in the sallow cheeks shone spots of color which had never before been 3
present. The lips, too, seemed unusual, being tightly compressed, as if by the 3
force of a stronger character than had been Slater's. The whole face finally began 3
to grow tense, and the head turned restlessly with closed eyes. 3
3
I did not rouse the sleeping nurse, but readjusted the slightly disarranged 3
headband of my telepathic "radio", intent to catch any parting message the 3
dreamer might have to deliver. All at once the head turned sharply in my 3
direction and the eyes fell open, causing me to stare in blank amazement at what 3
I beheld. The man who had been Joe Slater, the Catskill decadent, was gazing at 3
me with a pair of luminous, expanding eyes whose blue seemed subtly to have 3
deepened. Neither mania nor degeneracy was visible in that gaze, and I felt 3
beyond a doubt that I was viewing a face behind which lay an active mind of 3
high order. 3
3
At this juncture my brain became aware of a steady external influence operating 3
upon it. I closed my eyes to concentrate my thoughts more profoundly and was 3
rewarded by the positive knowledge that my long-sought mental message had 3
come at last. Each transmitted idea formed rapidly in my mind, and though no 3
3
3
3
99 3
3
3
3
actual language was employed, my habitual association of conception and 3
expression was so great that I seemed to be receiving the message in ordinary 3
English. 3
3
"Joe Slater is dead/' came the soul-petrifying voice of an agency from beyond the 3
wall of sleep. My opened eyes sought the couch of pain in curious horror, but the 3
blue eyes were still calmly gazing, and the countenance was still intelligently 3
animated. "He is better dead, for he was unfit to bear the active intellect of 3
cosmic entity. His gross body could not undergo the needed adjustments 3
between ethereal life and planet life. He was too much an animal, too little a 3
man; yet it is through his deficiency that you have come to discover me, for the 3
cosmic and planet souls rightly should never meet. He has been in my torment 3
and diurnal prison for forty-two of your terrestrial years. 3
3
"I am an entity like that which you yourself become in the freedom of dreamless 3
sleep. I am your brother of light, and have floated with you in the effulgent 3
valleys. It is not permitted me to tell your waking earth-self of your real self, but 3
we are all roamers of vast spaces and travelers in many ages. Next year I may be 3
dwelling in the Egypt which you call ancient, or in the cruel empire of Tsan Chan 3
which is to come three thousand years hence. You and I have drifted to the 3
worlds that reel about the red Arcturus, and dwelt in the bodies of the insect- 3
philosophers that crawl proudly over the fourth moon of Jupiter. How little does 3
the earth self know life and its extent! How little, indeed, ought it to know for its 3
own tranquility! 3
3
"Of the oppressor I cannot speak. You on earth have unwittingly felt its distant 3
presence - you who without knowing idly gave the blinking beacon the name of 3
Algol, the Demon-Star. It is to meet and conquer the oppressor that I have vainly 3
striven for eons, held back by bodily encumbrances. Tonight I go as a Nemesis 3
bearing just and blazingly cataclysmic vengeance. Watch me in the sky close by 3
the Demon-Star. 3
3
"I cannot speak longer, for the body of Joe Slater grows cold and rigid, and the 3
coarse brains are ceasing to vibrate as I wish. You have been my only friend on 3
this planet - the only soul to sense and seek for me within the repellent form 3
which lies on this couch. We shall meet again - perhaps in the shining mists of 3
Orion's Sword, perhaps on a bleak plateau in prehistoric Asia, perhaps in 3
unremembered dreams tonight, perhaps in some other form an eon hence, when 3
the solar system shall have been swept away." 3
3
At this point the thought-waves abruptly ceased, the pale eyes of the dreamer - 3
or can I say dead man? - commenced to glaze fishily. In a half-stupor I crossed 3
over to the couch and felt of his wrist, but found it cold, stiff, and pulseless. The 3
3
3
3
100 3
3
3
3
sallow cheeks paled again, and the thick lips fell open, disclosing the repulsively 3
rotten fangs of the degenerate Joe Slater. I shivered, pulled a blanket over the 3
hideous face, and awakened the nurse. Then I left the cell and went silently to 3
my room. I had an instant and unaccountable craving for a sleep whose dreams I 3
should not remember. 3
3
The climax? What plain tale of science can boast of such a rhetorical effect? I have 3
merely set down certain things appealing to me as facts, allowing you to 3
construe them as you will. As I have already admitted, my superior, old Doctor 3
Fenton, denies the reality of everything I have related. He vows that I was 3
broken down with nervous strain, and badly in need of a long vacation on full 3
pay which he so generously gave me. He assures me on his professional honor 3
that Joe Slater was but a low-grade paranoiac, whose fantastic notions must have 3
come from the crude hereditary folk-tales which circulated in even the most 3
decadent of communities. All this he tells me - yet I cannot forget what I saw in 3
the sky on the night after Slater died. Lest you think me a biased witness, another 3
pen must add this final testimony, which may perhaps supply the climax you 3
expect. I will quote the following account of the star Nova Persei verbatim from 3
the pages of that eminent astronomical authority. Professor Garrett P. Serviss: 3
3
"On February 22, 1901, a marvelous new star was discovered by Doctor 3
Anderson of Edinburgh, not very far from Algol. No star had been visible at that 3
point before. Within twenty-four hours the stranger had become so bright that it 3
outshone Capella. In a week or two it had visibly faded, and in the course of a 3
few months it was hardly discernible with the naked eye 3

In a dream Kuranes saw the city in the valley, and the seacoast beyond, and the 3

another name. Perhaps it was natural for him to dream a new name; for he was 3
the last of his family, and alone among the indifferent millions of London, so 3
there were not many to speak to him and to remind him who he had been. His 3
money and lands were gone, and he did not care for the ways of the people 3
about him, but preferred to dream and write of his dreams. What he wrote was 3
laughed at by those to whom he showed it, so that after a time he kept his 3
writings to himself, and finally ceased to write. The more he withdrew from the 3
world about him, the more wonderful became his dreams; and it would have 3
been quite futile to try to describe them on paper. Kuranes was not modern, and 3
did not think like others who wrote. Whilst they strove to strip from life its 3
embroidered robes of myth and to show in naked ugliness the foul thing that is 3
reality, Kuranes sought for beauty alone. When truth and experience failed to 3
reveal it, he sought it in fancy and illusion, and found it on his very doorstep, 3
amid the nebulous memories of childhood tales and dreams. 3
3
There are not many persons who know what wonders are opened to them in the 3
stories and visions of their youth; for when as children we listen and dream, we 3
think but half-formed thoughts, and when as men we try to remember, we are 3
dulled and prosaic with the poison of life. But some of us awake in the night with 3
strange phantasms of enchanted hills and gardens, of fountains that sing in the 3
sun, of golden cliffs overhanging murmuring seas, of plains that stretch down to 3
sleeping cities of bronze and stone, and of shadowy companies of heroes that 3
ride caparisoned white horses along the edges of thick forests; and then we know 3
that we have looked back through the ivory gates into that world of wonder 3
which was ours before we were wise and unhappy. 3
3
Kuranes came very suddenly upon his old world of childhood. He had been 3
dreaming of the house where he had been born; the great stone house covered 3
with ivy, where thirteen generations of his ancestors had lived, and where he 3
had hoped to die. It was moonlight, and he had stolen out into the fragrant 3
summer night, through the gardens, down the terraces, past the great oaks of the 3
park, and along the long white road to the village. The village seemed very old. 3
3

3
3
eaten away at the edge like the moon which had commenced to wane, and 3
Kuranes wondered whether the peaked roofs of the small houses hid sleep or 3
death. In the streets were spears of long grass, and the window-panes on either 3
side broken or filmily staring. Kuranes had not lingered, but had plodded on as 3
though summoned toward some goal. He dared not disobey the summons for 3
fear it might prove an illusion like the urges and aspirations of waking life, 3
which do not lead to any goal. Then he had been drawn down a lane that led off 3
from the village street toward the channel cliffs, and had come to the end of 3
things to the precipice and the abyss where all the village and all the world fell 3
abruptly into the unechoing emptiness of infinity, and where even the sky ahead 3
was empty and unlit by the crumbling moon and the peering stars. Faith had 3
urged him on, over the precipice and into the gulf, where he had floated down, 3
down, down; past dark, shapeless, undreamed dreams, faintly glowing spheres 3
that may have been partly dreamed dreams, and laughing winged things that 3
seemed to mock the dreamers of all the worlds. Then a rift seemed to open in the 3
darkness before him, and he saw the city of the valley, glistening radiantly far, 3
far below, with a background of sea and sky, and a snowcapped mountain near 3
the shore. 3
3
Kuranes had awakened the very moment he beheld the city, yet he knew from 3
his brief glance that it was none other than Celephais, in the Valley of Ooth- 3
Nargai beyond the Tanarian Hills where his spirit had dwelt all the eternity of an 3
hour one summer afternoon very long ago, when he had slipt away from his 3
nurse and let the warm sea-breeze lull him to sleep as he watched the clouds 3
from the cliff near the village. He had protested then, when they had found him, 3
waked him, and carried him home, for just as he was aroused he had been about 3
to sail in a golden galley for those alluring regions where the sea meets the sky. 3
And now he was equally resentful of awaking, for he had found his fabulous city 3
after forty weary years. 3
3
But three nights afterward Kuranes came again to Celephais. As before, he 3
dreamed first of the village that was asleep or dead, and of the abyss down 3
which one must float silently; then the rift appeared again, and he beheld the 3
glittering minarets of the city, and saw the graceful galleys riding at anchor in 3
the blue harbour, and watched the gingko trees of Mount Aran swaying in the 3
sea-breeze. But this time he was not snatched away, and like a winged being 3
settled gradually over a grassy hillside till finally his feet rested gently on the 3
turf. He had indeed come back to the Valley of Ooth-Nargai and the splendid 3
city of Celephais. 3
3
Down the hill amid scented grasses and brilliant flowers walked Kuranes, over 3
the bubbling Naraxa on the small wooden bridge where he had carved his name 3
so many years ago, and through the whispering grove to the great stone bridge 3
3
3
3
103 3
3
3
3
by the city gate. All was as of old, nor were the marble walls discoloured, nor the 3
polished bronze statues upon them tarnished. And Kuranes saw that he need not 3
tremble lest the things he knew be vanished; for even the sentries on the 3
ramparts were the same, and still as young as he remembered them. When he 3
entered the city, past the bronze gates and over the onyx pavements, the 3
merchants and camel-drivers greeted him as if he had never been away; and it 3
was the same at the turquoise temple of Nath-Horthath, where the orchid- 3
wreathed priests told him that there is no time in Ooth-Nargai, but only 3
perpetual youth. Then Kuranes walked through the Street of Pillars to the 3
seaward wall, where gathered the traders and sailors, and strange men from the 3
regions where the sea meets the sky. There he stayed long, gazing out over the 3
bright harbour where the ripples sparkled beneath an unknown sun, and where 3
rode lightly the galleys from far places over the water. And he gazed also upon 3
Mount Aran rising regally from the shore, its lower slopes green with swaying 3
trees and its white summit touching the sky. 3
3
More than ever Kuranes wished to sail in a galley to the far places of which he 3
had heard so many strange tales, and he sought again the captain who had 3
agreed to carry him so long ago. He found the man, Athib, sitting on the same 3
chest of spice he had sat upon before, and Athib seemed not to realize that any 3
time had passed. Then the two rowed to a galley in the harbour, and giving 3
orders to the oarmen, commenced to sail out into the billowy Cerenarian Sea that 3
leads to the sky. For several days they glided undulatingly over the water, till 3
finally they came to the horizon, where the sea meets the sky. Here the galley 3
paused not at all, but floated easily in the blue of the sky among fleecy clouds 3
tinted with rose. And far beneath the keel Kuranes could see strange lands and 3
rivers and cities of surpassing beauty, spread indolently in the sunshine which 3
seemed never to lessen or disappear. At length Athib told him that their journey 3
was near its end, and that they would soon enter the harbour of Serannian, the 3
pink marble city of the clouds, which is built on that ethereal coast where the 3
west wind flows into the sky; but as the highest of the city's carven towers came 3
into sight there was a sound somewhere in space, and Kuranes awaked in his 3
London garret. 3
3
For many months after that Kuranes sought the marvellous city of Celephais and 3
its sky-bound galleys in vain; and though his dreams carried him to many 3
gorgeous and unheard-of places, no one whom he met could tell him how to find 3
Ooth-Nargai beyond the Tanarian Hills. One night he went flying over dark 3
mountains where there were faint, lone campfires at great distances apart, and 3
strange, shaggy herds with tinkling bells on the leaders, and in the wildest part 3
of this hilly country, so remote that few men could ever have seen it, he found a 3
hideously ancient wall or causeway of stone zigzagging along the ridges and 3
valleys; too gigantic ever to have risen by human hands, and of such a length 3
3
3
3
104 3
3
3
3
that neither end of it could be seen. Beyond that wall in the grey dawn he came 3
to a land of quaint gardens and cherry trees, and when the sun rose he beheld 3
such beauty of red and white flowers, green foliage and lawns, white paths, 3
diamond brooks, blue lakelets, carven bridges, and red-roofed pagodas, that he 3
for a moment forgot Celephais in sheer delight. But he remembered it again 3
when he walked down a white path toward a red-roofed pagoda, and would 3
have questioned the people of this land about it, had he not found that there 3
were no people there, but only birds and bees and butterflies. On another night 3
Kuranes walked up a damp stone spiral stairway endlessly, and came to a tower 3
window overlooking a mighty plain and river lit by the full moon; and in the 3
silent city that spread away from the river bank he thought he beheld some 3
feature or arrangement which he had known before. He would have descended 3
and asked the way to Ooth-Nargai had not a fearsome aurora sputtered up from 3
some remote place beyond the horizon, showing the ruin and antiquity of the 3
city, and the stagnation of the reedy river, and the death lying upon that land, as 3
it had lain since King Kynaratholis came home from his conquests to find the 3
vengeance of the gods. 3
3
So Kuranes sought fruitlessly for the marvellous city of Celephais and its galleys 3
that sail to Serannian in the sky, meanwhile seeing many wonders and once 3
barely escaping from the high-priest not to be described, which wears a yellow 3
silken mask over its face and dwells all alone in a prehistoric stone monastery in 3
the cold desert plateau of Leng. In time he grew so impatient of the bleak 3
intervals of day that he began buying drugs in order to increase his periods of 3
sleep. Hasheesh helped a great deal, and once sent him to a part of space where 3
form does not exist, but where glowing gases study the secrets of existence. And 3
a violet-coloured gas told him that this part of space was outside what he had 3
called infinity. The gas had not heard of planets and organisms before, but 3
identified Kuranes merely as one from the infinity where matter, energy, and 3
gravitation exist. Kuranes was now very anxious to return to minaret-studded 3
Celephais, and increased his doses of drugs; but eventually he had no more 3
money left, and could buy no drugs. Then one summer day he was turned out of 3
his garret, and wandered aimlessly through the streets, drifting over a bridge to a 3
place where the houses grew thinner and thinner. And it was there that 3
fulfillment came, and he met the cortege of knights come from Celephais to bear 3
him thither forever. 3
3
Handsome knights they were, astride roan horses and clad in shining armour 3
with tabards of cloth-of- gold curiously emblazoned. So numerous were they, 3
that Kuranes almost mistook them for an army, but they were sent in his honour; 3
since it was he who had created Ooth-Nargai in his dreams, on which account he 3
was now to be appointed its chief god for evermore. Then they gave Kuranes a 3
horse and placed him at the head of the cavalcade, and all rode majestically 3
3
3
3
105 3
3
3
3
through the downs of Surrey and onward toward the region where Kuranes and 3
his ancestors were born. It was very strange, but as the riders went on they 3
seemed to gallop back through Time; for whenever they passed through a village 3
in the twilight they saw only such houses and villagers as Chaucer or men before 3
him might have seen, and sometimes they saw knights on horseback with small 3
companies of retainers. When it grew dark they travelled more swiftly, till soon 3
they were flying uncannily as if in the air. In the dim dawn they came upon the 3
village which Kuranes had seen alive in his childhood, and asleep or dead in his 3
dreams. It was alive now, and early villagers curtsied as the horsemen clattered 3
down the street and turned off into the lane that ends in the abyss of dreams. 3
Kuranes had previously entered that abyss only at night, and wondered what it 3
would look like by day; so he watched anxiously as the column approached its 3
brink. Just as they galloped up the rising ground to the precipice a golden glare 3
came somewhere out of the west and hid all the landscape in effulgent draperies. 3
The abyss was a seething chaos of roseate and cerulean splendour, and invisible 3
voices sang exultantly as the knightly entourage plunged over the edge and 3
floated gracefully down past glittering clouds and silvery coruscations. Endlessly 3
down the horsemen floated, their chargers pawing the aether as if galloping over 3
golden sands; and then the luminous vapours spread apart to reveal a greater 3
brightness, the brightness of the city Celephais, and the sea coast beyond, and the 3
snowy peak overlooking the sea, and the gaily painted galleys that sail out of the 3
harbour toward distant regions where the sea meets the sky. 3
3
And Kuranes reigned thereafter over Ooth-Nargai and all the neighboring 3
regions of dream, and held his court alternately in Celephais and in the cloud- 3
fashioned Serannian. He reigns there still, and will reign happily for ever, though 3
below the cliffs at Innsmouth the channel tides played mockingly with the body 3
of a tramp who had stumbled through the half-deserted village at dawn; played 3
mockingly, and cast it upon the rocks by ivy-covered Trevor Towers, where a 3
notably fat and especially offensive millionaire brewer enjoys the purchased 3
atmosphere of extinct nobility. 3

3
You ask me to explain why I am afraid of a draught of cool air; why I shiver 3
more than others upon entering a cold room, and seem nauseated and repelled 3
when the chill of evening creeps through the heat of a mild autumn day. There 3
are those who say I respond to cold as others do to a bad odour, and I am the last 3
to deny the impression. What I will do is to relate the most horrible circumstance 3
I ever encountered, and leave it to you to judge whether or not this forms a 3
suitable explanation of my peculiarity. 3
3
It is a mistake to fancy that horror is associated inextricably with darkness, 3
silence, and solitude. I found it in the glare of mid-afternoon, in the clangour of a 3
metropolis, and in the teeming midst of a shabby and commonplace rooming- 3
house with a prosaic landlady and two stalwart men by my side. In the spring of 3
1923 I had secured some dreary and unprofitable magazine work in the city of 3
New York; and being unable to pay any substantial rent, began drifting from one 3
cheap boarding establishment to another in search of a room which might 3
combine the qualities of decent cleanliness, endurable furnishings, and very 3
reasonable price. It soon developed that I had only a choice between different 3
evils, but after a time I came upon a house in West Fourteenth Street which 3
disgusted me much less than the others I had sampled. 3
3
The place was a four-story mansion of brownstone, dating apparently from the 3
late forties, and fitted with woodwork and marble whose stained and sullied 3
splendour argued a descent from high levels of tasteful opulence. In the rooms, 3
large and lofty, and decorated with impossible paper and ridiculously ornate 3
stucco cornices, there lingered a depressing mustiness and hint of obscure 3
cookery; but the floors were clean, the linen tolerably regular, and the hot water 3
not too often cold or turned off, so that I came to regard it as at least a bearable 3
place to hibernate till one might really live again. The landlady, a slatternly, 3
almost bearded Spanish woman named Herrero, did not annoy me with gossip 3
or with criticisms of the late-burning electric light in my third-floor front hall 3
room; and my fellow-lodgers were as quiet and uncommunicative as one might 3
desire, being mostly Spaniards a little above the coarsest and crudest grade. Only 3
the din of street cars in the thoroughfare below proved a serious annoyance. 3
3
I had been there about three weeks when the first odd incident occurred. One 3
evening at about eight I heard a spattering on the floor and became suddenly 3
3
3
3
107 3
3
3
3
aware that I had been smeUing the pungent odour of ammonia for some time. 3
Looking about, I saw that the ceihng was wet and dripping; the soaking 3
apparently proceeding from a corner on the side toward the street. Anxious to 3
stop the matter at its source, I hastened to the basement to tell the landlady; and 3
was assured by her that the trouble would quickly be set right. 3
3
"Doctair Munoz," she cried as she rushed upstairs ahead of me, "he have speel 3
hees chemicals. He ees too seeck for doctair heemself-seecker and seecker all the 3
time-but he weel not have no othair for help. He ees vairy queer in hees 3
seeckness-all day he take funnee-smelling baths, and he cannot get excite or 3
warm. All hees own housework he do-hees leetle room are full of bottles and 3
machines, and he do not work as doctair. But he was great once-my fathair in 3
Barcelona have hear of heem-and only joost now he feex a arm of the plumber 3
that get hurt of sudden. He nevair go out, only on roof, and my boy Esteban he 3
breeng heem hees food and laundry and mediceens and chemicals. My Gawd, 3
the sal-ammoniac that man use for keep heem cool!" 3
3
Mrs. Herrero disappeared up the staircase to the fourth floor, and I returned to 3
my room. The ammonia ceased to drip, and as I cleaned up what had spilled and 3
opened the window for air, I heard the landlady's heavy footsteps above me. Dr. 3
Munoz I had never heard, save for certain sounds as of some gasoline- driven 3
mechanism; since his step was soft and gentle. I wondered for a moment what 3
the strange affliction of this man might be, and whether his obstinate refusal of 3
outside aid were not the result of a rather baseless eccentricity. There is, I 3
reflected tritely, an infinite deal of pathos in the state of an eminent person who 3
has come down in the world. 3
3
I might never have known Dr. Munoz had it not been for the heart attack that 3
suddenly seized me one forenoon as I sat writing in my room. Physicians had 3
told me of the danger of those spells, and I knew there was no time to be lost; so 3
remembering what the landlady had said about the invalid's help of the injured 3
workman, I dragged myself upstairs and knocked feebly at the door above mine. 3
My knock was answered in good English by a curious voice some distance to the 3
right, asking my name and business; and these things being stated, there came an 3
opening of the door next to the one I had sought. 3
3
A rush of cool air greeted me; and though the day was one of the hottest of late 3
June, I shivered as I crossed the threshold into a large apartment whose rich and 3
tasteful decoration surprised me in this nest of squalor and seediness. A folding 3
couch now filled its diurnal role of sofa, and the mahogany furniture, sumptuous 3
hangings, old paintings, and mellow bookshelves all bespoke a gentleman's 3
study rather than a boarding-house bedroom. I now saw that the hall room 3
above mine-the "leetle room" of bottles and machines which Mrs. Herrero had 3
3
3
3
108 3
3
3
3
mentioned-was merely the laboratory of the doctor; and that his main living 3
quarters lay in the spacious adjoining room whose convenient alcoves and large 3
contiguous bathroom permitted him to hide all dressers and obtrusively 3
utilitarian devices. Dr. Munoz, most certainly, was a man of birth, cultivation, 3
and discrimination. 3
3
The figure before me was short but exquisitely proportioned, and clad in 3
somewhat formal dress of perfect cut and fit. A high-bred face of masterful 3
though not arrogant expression was adorned by a short iron-grey full beard, and 3
an old-fashioned pince-nez shielded the full, dark eyes and surmounted an 3
aquiline nose which gave a Moorish touch to a physiognomy otherwise 3
dominantly Celtiberian. Thick, well-trimmed hair that argued the punctual calls 3
of a barber was parted gracefully above a high forehead; and the whole picture 3
was one of striking intelligence and superior blood and breeding. 3
3
Nevertheless, as I saw Dr. Munoz in that blast of cool air, I felt a repugnance 3
which nothing in his aspect could justify. Only his lividly inclined complexion 3
and coldness of touch could have afforded a physical basis for this feeling, and 3
even these things should have been excusable considering the man's known 3
invalidism. It might, too, have been the singular cold that alienated me; for such 3
chilliness was abnormal on so hot a day, and the abnormal always excites 3
aversion, distrust, and fear. 3
3
But repugnance was soon forgotten in admiration, for the strange physician's 3
extreme skill at once became manifest despite the ice-coldness and shakiness of 3
his bloodless-looking hands. He clearly understood my needs at a glance, and 3
ministered to them with a master's deftness; the while reassuring me in a finely 3
modulated though oddly hollow and timbreless voice that he was the bitterest of 3
sworn enemies to death, and had sunk his fortune and lost all his friends in a 3
lifetime of bizarre experiment devoted to its bafflement and extirpation. 3
Something of the benevolent fanatic seemed to reside in him, and he rambled on 3
almost garrulously as he sounded my chest and mixed a suitable draught of 3
drugs fetched from the smaller laboratory room. Evidently he found the society 3
of a well-born man a rare novelty in this dingy environment, and was moved to 3
unaccustomed speech as memories of better days surged over him. 3
3
His voice, if queer, was at least soothing; and I could not even perceive that he 3
breathed as the fluent sentences rolled urbanely out. He sought to distract my 3
mind from my own seizure by speaking of his theories and experiments; and I 3
remember his tactfully consoling me about my weak heart by insisting that will 3
and consciousness are stronger than organic life itself, so that if a bodily frame be 3
but originally healthy and carefully preserved, it may through a scientific 3
enhancement of these qualities retain a kind of nervous animation despite the 3
3
3
3
109 3
3
3
3
most serious impairments, defects, or even absences in the battery of specific 3
organs. He might, he half jestingly said, some day teach me to live-or at least to 3
possess some kind of conscious existence-without any heart at all! For his part, 3
he was afflicted with a complication of maladies requiring a very exact regimen 3
which included constant cold. Any marked rise in temperature might, if 3
prolonged, affect him fatally; and the frigidity of his habitation-some 55 or 56 3
degrees Fahrenheit- was maintained by an absorption system of ammonia 3
cooling, the gasoline engine of whose pumps I had often heard in my own room 3
below. 3
3
Relieved of my seizure in a marvellously short while, I left the shivery place a 3
disciple and devotee of the gifted recluse. After that I paid him frequent 3
overcoated calls; listening while he told of secret researches and almost ghastly 3
results, and trembling a bit when I examined the unconventional and 3
astonishingly ancient volumes on his shelves. I was eventually, I may add, 3
almost cured of my disease for all time by his skillful ministrations. It seems that 3
he did not scorn the incantations of the mediaevalists, since he believed these 3
cryptic formulae to contain rare psychological stimuli which might conceivably 3
have singular effects on the substance of a nervous system from which organic 3
pulsations had fled. I was touched by his account of the aged Dr. Torres of 3
Valencia, who had shared his earlier experiments and nursed him through the 3
great illness of eighteen years before, whence his present disorders proceeded. 3
No sooner had the venerable practitioner saved his colleague than he himself 3
succumbed to the grim enemy he had fought. Perhaps the strain had been too 3
great; for Dr. Munoz made it whisperingly clear- though not in detail-that the 3
methods of healing had been most extraordinary, involving scenes and processes 3
not welcomed by elderly and conservative Galens. 3
3
As the weeks passed, I observed with regret that my new friend was indeed 3
slowly but unmistakably losing ground physically, as Mrs. Herrero had 3
suggested. The livid aspect of his countenance was intensified, his voice became 3
more hollow and indistinct, his muscular motions were less perfectly 3
coordinated, and his mind and will displayed less resilience and initiative. Of 3
this sad change he seemed by no means unaware, and little by little his 3
expression and conversation both took on a gruesome irony which restored in 3
me something of the subtle repulsion I had originally felt. 3
3
He developed strange caprices, acquiring a fondness for exotic spices and 3
Egyptian incense till his room smelled like a vault of a sepulchred Pharaoh in the 3
Valley of Kings. At the same time his demands for cold air increased, and with 3
my aid he amplified the ammonia piping of his room and modified the pumps 3
and feed of his refrigerating machine till he could keep the temperature as low as 3
34 degrees or 40 degrees, and finally even 28 degrees; the bathroom and 3
3
3
3
110 3
3
3
3
laboratory, of course, being less chilled, in order that water might not freeze, and 3
that chemical processes might not be impeded. The tenant adjoining him 3
complained of the icy air from around the connecting door, so I helped him fit 3
heavy hangings to obviate the difficulty. A kind of growing horror, of outre and 3
morbid cast, seemed to possess him. He talked of death incessantly, but laughed 3
hollowly when such things as burial or funeral arrangements were gently 3
suggested. 3
3
All in all, he became a disconcerting and even gruesome companion; yet in my 3
gratitude for his healing I could not well abandon him to the strangers around 3
him, and was careful to dust his room and attend to his needs each day, muffled 3
in a heavy ulster which I bought especially for the purpose. I likewise did much 3
of his shopping, and gasped in bafflement at some of the chemicals he ordered 3
from druggists and laboratory supply houses. 3
3
An increasing and unexplained atmosphere of panic seemed to rise around his 3
apartment. The whole house, as I have said, had a musty odour; but the smell in 3
his room was worse-and in spite of all the spices and incense, and the pungent 3
chemicals of the now incessant baths which he insisted on taking unaided. I 3
perceived that it must be connected with his ailment, and shuddered when I 3
reflected on what that ailment might be. Mrs. Herrero crossed herself when she 3
looked at him, and gave him up unreservedly to me; not even letting her son 3
Esteban continue to run errands for him. When I suggested other physicians, the 3
sufferer would fly into as much of a rage as he seemed to dare to entertain. He 3
evidently feared the physical effect of violent emotion, yet his will and driving 3
force waxed rather than waned, and he refused to be confined to his bed. The 3
lassitude of his earlier ill days gave place to a return of his fiery purpose, so that 3
he seemed about to hurl defiance at the death-daemon even as that ancient 3
enemy seized him. The pretence of eating, always curiously like a formality with 3
him, he virtually abandoned; and mental power alone appeared to keep him 3
from total collapse. 3
3
He acquired a habit of writing long documents of some sort, which he carefully 3
sealed and filled with injunctions that I transmit them after his death to certain 3
persons whom he named-for the most part lettered East Indians, but including a 3
once celebrated French physician now generally thought dead, and about whom 3
the most inconceivable things had been whispered. As it happened, I burned all 3
these papers undelivered and unopened. His aspect and voice became utterly 3
frightful, and his presence almost unbearable. One September day an unexpected 3
glimpse of him induced an epileptic fit in a man who had come to repair his 3
electric desk lamp; a fit for which he prescribed effectively whilst keeping 3
himself well out of sight. That man, oddly enough, had been through the terrors 3
of the Great War without having incurred any fright so thorough. 3

Then, in the middle of October, the horror of horrors came with stupefying 3
suddenness. One night about eleven the pump of the refrigerating machine 3
broke down, so that within three hours the process of ammonia cooling became 3
impossible. Dr. Munoz summoned me by thumping on the floor, and I worked 3
desperately to repair the injury while my host cursed in a tone whose lifeless, 3
rattling hollowness surpassed description. My amateur efforts, however, proved 3
of no use; and when I had brought in a mechanic from a neighbouring all-night 3
garage, we learned that nothing could be done till morning, when a new piston 3
would have to be obtained. The moribund hermit's rage and fear, swelling to 3
grotesque proportions, seemed likely to shatter what remained of his failing 3
physique, and once a spasm caused him to clap his hands to his eyes and rush 3
into the bathroom. He groped his way out with face tightly bandaged, and I 3
never saw his eyes again. 3

The frigidity of the apartment was now sensibly diminishing, and at about 5 a.m. 3
the doctor retired to the bathroom, commanding me to keep him supplied with 3
all the ice I could obtain at all-night drug stores and cafeterias. As I would return 3
from my sometimes discouraging trips and lay my spoils before the closed 3
bathroom door, I could hear a restless splashing within, and a thick voice 3
croaking out the order for "More-more!" At length a warm day broke, and the 3
shops opened one by one. I asked Esteban either to help with the ice-fetching 3
whilst I obtained the pump piston, or to order the piston while I continued with 3
the ice; but instructed by his mother, he absolutely refused. 3
3
Finally I hired a seedy-looking loafer whom I encountered on the corner of 3
Eighth Avenue to keep the patient supplied with ice from a little shop where I 3
introduced him, and applied myself diligently to the task of finding a pump 3
piston and engaging workmen competent to install it. The task seemed 3
interminable, and I raged almost as violently as the hermit when I saw the hours 3
slipping by in a breathless, foodless round of vain telephoning, and a hectic quest 3
from place to place, hither and thither by subway and surface car. About noon I 3
encountered a suitable supply house far downtown, and at approximately 1:30 3
p.m. arrived at my boarding-place with the necessary paraphernalia and two 3
sturdy and intelligent mechanics. I had done all I could, and hoped I was in time. 3
3
Black terror, however, had preceded me. The house was in utter turmoil, and 3
above the chatter of awed voices I heard a man praying in a deep basso. Fiendish 3
things were in the air, and lodgers told over the beads of their rosaries as they 3
caught the odour from beneath the doctor's closed door. The lounger I had hired, 3
it seems, had fled screaming and mad-eyed not long after his second delivery of 3
ice; perhaps as a result of excessive curiosity. He could not, of course, have 3
locked the door behind him; yet it was now fastened, presumably from the 3
inside. There was no sound within save a nameless sort of slow, thick dripping. 3

3
Briefly consulting with Mrs. Herrero and the workmen despite a fear that 3
gnawed my inmost soul, I advised the breaking down of the door; but the 3
landlady found a way to turn the key from the outside with some wire device. 3
We had previously opened the doors of all the other rooms on that hall, and 3
flung all the windows to the very top. Now, noses protected by handkerchiefs, 3
we tremblingly invaded the accursed south room which blazed with the warm 3
sun of early afternoon. 3
3
A kind of dark, slimy trail led from the open bathroom door to the hall door, and 3
thence to the desk, where a terrible little pool had accumulated. Something was 3
scrawled there in pencil in an awful, blind hand on a piece of paper hideously 3
smeared as though by the very claws that traced the hurried last words. Then the 3
trail led to the couch and ended unutterably. 3
3
What was, or had been, on the couch I cannot and dare not say here. But this is 3
what I shiveringly puzzled out on the stickily smeared paper before I drew a 3
match and burned it to a crisp; what I puzzled out in terror as the landlady and 3
two mechanics rushed frantically from that hellish place to babble their 3
incoherent stories at the nearest police station. The nauseous words seemed well- 3
nigh incredible in that yellow sunlight, with the clatter of cars and motor trucks 3
ascending clamorously from crowded Fourteenth Street, yet I confess that I 3
believed them then. Whether I believe them now I honestly do not know. There 3
are things about which it is better not to speculate, and all that I can say is that I 3
hate the smell of ammonia, and grow faint at a draught of unusually cool air. 3
3
"The end," ran that noisome scrawl, "is here. No more ice-the man looked and 3
ran away. Warmer every minute, and the tissues can't last. I fancy you know- 3
what I said about the will and the nerves and the preserved body after the organs 3
ceased to work. It was good theory, but couldn't keep up indefinitely. There was 3
a gradual deterioration I had not foreseen. Dr. Torres knew, but the shock killed 3
him. He couldn't stand what he had to do-he had to get me in a strange, dark 3
place when he minded my letter and nursed me back. And the organs never 3
would work again. It had to be done my way-preservation-for you see I died 3
that time eighteen years ago." 3

3
I am writing this under an appreciable mental strain, since by tonight I shall be 3
no more. Penniless, and at the end of my supply of the drug which alone, makes 3
life endurable, I can bear the torture no longer; and shall cast myself from this 3
garret window into the squalid street below. Do not think from my slavery to 3
morphine that I am a weakling or a degenerate. When you have read these 3
hastily scrawled pages you may guess, though never fully realise, why it is that I 3
must have forgetfulness or death. 3
3
It was in one of the most open and least frequented parts of the broad Pacific that 3
the packet of which I was supercargo fell a victim to the German sea-raider. The 3
great war was then at its very beginning, and the ocean forces of the Hun had not 3
completely sunk to their later degradation; so that our vessel was made a 3
legitimate prize, whilst we of her crew were treated with all the fairness and 3
consideration due us as naval prisoners. So liberal, indeed, was the discipline of 3
our captors, that five days after we were taken I managed to escape alone in a 3
small boat with water and provisions for a good length of time. 3
3
When I finally found myself adrift and free, I had but little idea of my 3
surroundings. Never a competent navigator, I could only guess vaguely by the 3
sun and stars that I was somewhat south of the equator. Of the longitude I knew 3
nothing, and no island or coastline was in sight. The weather kept fair, and for 3
uncounted days I drifted aimlessly beneath the scorching sun; waiting either for 3
some passing ship, or to be cast on the shores of some habitable land. But neither 3
ship nor land appeared, and I began to despair in my solitude upon the heaving 3
vastness of unbroken blue. 3
3
The change happened whilst I slept. Its details I shall never know; for my 3
slumber, though troubled and dream-infested, was continuous. When at last I 3
awakened, it was to discover myself half sucked into a slimy expanse of hellish 3
black mire which extended about me in monotonous undulations as far as I 3
could see, and in which my boat lay grounded some distance away. 3
3
Though one might well imagine that my first sensation would be of wonder at so 3
prodigious and unexpected a transformation of scenery, I was in reality more 3
horrified than astonished; for there was in the air and in the rotting soil a sinister 3
quality which chilled me to the very core. The region was putrid with the 3
3
3
3
114 3
3
3
3
carcasses of decaying fish, and of other less describable things which I saw 3
protruding from the nasty mud of the unending plain. Perhaps I should not hope 3
to convey in mere words the unutterable hideousness that can dwell in absolute 3
silence and barren immensity. There was nothing within hearing, and nothing in 3
sight save a vast reach of black slime; yet the very completeness of the stillness 3
and the homogeneity of the landscape oppressed me with a nauseating fear. 3
3
The sun was blazing down from a sky which seemed to me almost black in its 3
cloudless cruelty; as though reflecting the inky marsh beneath my feet. As I 3
crawled into the stranded boat I realised that only one theory could explain my 3
position. Through some unprecedented volcanic upheaval, a portion of the ocean 3
floor must have been thrown to the surface, exposing regions which for 3
innumerable millions of years had lain hidden under unfathomable watery 3
depths. So great was the extent of the new land which had risen beneath me, that 3
I could not detect the faintest noise of the surging ocean, strain my ears as I 3
might. Nor were there any sea-fowl to prey upon the dead things. 3
3
For several hours I sat thinking or brooding in the boat, which lay upon its side 3
and afforded a slight shade as the sun moved across the heavens. As the day 3
progressed, the ground lost some of its stickiness, and seemed likely to dry 3
sufficiently for travelling purposes in a short time. That night I slept but little, 3
and the next day I made for myself a pack containing food and water, 3
preparatory to an overland journey in search of the vanished sea and possible 3
rescue. 3
3
On the third morning I found the soil dry enough to walk upon with ease. The 3
odour of the fish was maddening; but I was too much concerned with graver 3
things to mind so slight an evil, and set out boldly for an unknown goal. All day 3
I forged steadily westward, guided by a far-away hummock which rose higher 3
than any other elevation on the rolling desert. That night I encamped, and on the 3
following day still travelled toward the hummock, though that object seemed 3
scarcely nearer than when I had first espied it. By the fourth evening I attained 3
the base of the mound, which turned out to be much higher than it had appeared 3
from a distance, an intervening valley setting it out in sharper relief from the 3
general surface. Too weary to ascend, I slept in the shadow of the hill. 3
3
I know not why my dreams were so wild that night; but ere the waning and 3
fantastically gibbous moon had risen far above the eastern plain, I was awake in 3
a cold perspiration, determined to sleep no more. Such visions as I had 3
experienced were too much for me to endure again. And in the glow of the moon 3
I saw how unwise I had been to travel by day. Without the glare of the parching 3
sun, my journey would have cost me less energy; indeed, I now felt quite able to 3
3
3
3
115 3
3
3
3
perform the ascent which had deterred me at sunset. Picking up my pack, I 3
started for the crest of the eminence. 3
3
I have said that the unbroken monotony of the rolHng plain was a source of 3
vague horror to me; but I think my horror was greater when I gained the summit 3
of the mound and looked down the other side into an immeasurable pit or 3
canyon, whose black recesses the moon had not yet soared high enough to 3
illumine. I felt myself on the edge of the world, peering over the rim into a 3
fathomless chaos of eternal night. Through my terror ran curious reminiscences 3
of Paradise Lost, and Satan's hideous climb through the unfashioned realms of 3
darkness. 3
3
As the moon climbed higher in the sky, I began to see that the slopes of the valley 3
were not quite so perpendicular as I had imagined. Ledges and outcroppings of 3
rock afforded fairly easy footholds for a descent, whilst after a drop of a few 3
hundred feet, the declivity became very gradual. Urged on by an impulse which 3
I cannot definitely analyse, I scrambled with difficulty down the rocks and stood 3
on the gentler slope beneath, gazing into the Stygian deeps where no light had 3
yet penetrated. 3
3
All at once my attention was captured by a vast and singular object on the 3
opposite slope, which rose steeply about a hundred yards ahead of me; an object 3
that gleamed whitely in the newly bestowed rays of the ascending moon. That it 3
was merely a gigantic piece of stone, I soon assured myself; but I was conscious 3
of a distinct impression that its contour and position were not altogether the 3
work of Nature. A closer scrutiny filled me with sensations I cannot express; for 3
despite its enormous magnitude, and its position in an abyss which had yawned 3
at the bottom of the sea since the world was young, I perceived beyond a doubt 3
that the strange object was a well-shaped monolith whose massive bulk had 3
known the workmanship and perhaps the worship of living and thinking 3
creatures. 3
3
Dazed and frightened, yet not without a certain thrill of the scientist's or 3
archaeologist's delight, I examined my surroundings more closely. The moon, 3
now near the zenith, shone weirdly and vividly above the towering steeps that 3
hemmed in the chasm, and revealed the fact that a far-flung body of water 3
flowed at the bottom, winding out of sight in both directions, and almost lapping 3
my feet as I stood on the slope. Across the chasm, the wavelets washed the base 3
of the Cyclopean monolith, on whose surface I could now trace both inscriptions 3
and crude sculptures. The writing was in a system of hieroglyphics unknown to 3
me, and unlike anything I had ever seen in books, consisting for the most part of 3
conventionalised aquatic symbols such as fishes, eels, octopi, crustaceans, 3
molluscs, whales and the like. Several characters obviously represented marine 3
3
3
3
116 3
3
3
3
things which are unknown to the modern world, but whose decomposing forms 3
I had observed on the ocean-risen plain. 3
3
It was the pictorial carving, however, that did most to hold me spellbound. 3
Plainly visible across the intervening water on account of their enormous size 3
was an array of bas-reliefs whose subjects would have excited the envy of a Dore. 3
I think that these things were supposed to depict men — at least, a certain sort of 3
men; though the creatures were shown disporting like fishes in the waters of 3
some marine grotto, or paying homage at some monolithic shrine which 3
appeared to be under the waves as well. Of their faces and forms I dare not speak 3
in detail, for the mere remembrance makes me grow faint. Grotesque beyond the 3
imagination of a Poe or a Bulwer, they were damnably human in general outline 3
despite webbed hands and feet, shockingly wide and flabby lips, glassy, bulging 3
eyes, and other features less pleasant to recall. Curiously enough, they seemed to 3
have been chiselled badly out of proportion with their scenic background; for 3
one of the creatures was shown in the act of killing a whale represented as but 3
little larger than himself. I remarked, as I say, their grotesqueness and strange 3
size; but in a moment decided that they were merely the imaginary gods of some 3
primitive fishing or seafaring tribe; some tribe whose last descendant had 3
perished eras before the first ancestor of the Piltdown or Neanderthal Man was 3
born. Awestruck at this unexpected glimpse into a past beyond the conception of 3
the most daring anthropologist, I stood musing whilst the moon cast queer 3
reflections on the silent channel before me. 3
3
Then suddenly I saw it. With only a slight churning to mark its rise to the 3
surface, the thing slid into view above the dark waters. Vast, Polyphemus-like, 3
and loathsome, it darted like a stupendous monster of nightmares to the 3
monolith, about which it flung its gigantic scaly arms, the while it bowed its 3
hideous head and gave vent to certain measured sounds. I think I went mad 3
then. 3
3
Of my frantic ascent of the slope and cliff, and of my delirious journey back to 3
the stranded boat, I remember little. I believe I sang a great deal, and laughed 3
oddly when I was unable to sing. I have indistinct recollections of a great storm 3
some time after I reached the boat; at any rate, I knew that I heard peals of 3
thunder and other tones which Nature utters only in her wildest moods. 3
3
When I came out of the shadows I was in a San Francisco hospital; brought 3
thither by the captain of the American ship which had picked up my boat in mid- 3
ocean. In my delirium I had said much, but found that my words had been given 3
scant attention. Of any land upheaval in the Pacific, my rescuers knew nothing; 3
nor did I deem it necessary to insist upon a thing which I knew they could not 3
believe. Once I sought out a celebrated ethnologist, and amused him with 3
3
3
3
117 3
3
3
3
peculiar questions regarding the ancient Philistine legend of Dagon, the Fish- 3
God; but soon perceiving that he was hopelessly conventional, I did not press my 3
inquiries. 3
3
It is at night, especially when the moon is gibbous and waning, that I see the 3
thing. I tried morphine; but the drug has given only transient surcease, and has 3
drawn me into its clutches as a hopeless slave. So now I am to end it all, having 3
written a full account for the information or the contemptuous amusement of my 3
fellow-men. Often I ask myself if it could not all have been a pure phantasm — a 3
mere freak of fever as I lay sun-stricken and raving in the open boat after my 3
escape from the German man-of-war. This I ask myself, but ever does there come 3
before me a hideously vivid vision in reply. I cannot think of the deep sea 3
without shuddering at the nameless things that may at this very moment be 3
crawling and floundering on its slimy bed, worshipping their ancient stone idols 3
and carving their own detestable likenesses on submarine obelisks of water- 3
soaked granite. I dream of a day when they may rise above the billows to drag 3
down in their reeking talons the remnants of puny, war-exhausted mankind — 3
of a day when the land shall sink, and the dark ocean floor shall ascend amidst 3
universal pandemonium. 3
3
The end is near. I hear a noise at the door, as of some immense slippery body 3
lumbering against it. It shall not find me. God, that hand! The window! The 3
window! 3

3
Whether the dreams brought on the fever or the fever brought on the dreams 3
Walter Gilman did not know. Behind everything crouched the brooding, 3
festering horror of the ancient town, and of the mouldy, unhallowed garret gable 3
where he wrote and studied and wrestled with figures and formulae when he 3
was not tossing on the meagre iron bed. His ears were growing sensitive to a 3
preternatural and intolerable degree, and he had long ago stopped the cheap 3
mantel clock whose ticking had come to seem like a thunder of artillery. At night 3
the subtle stirring of the black city outside, the sinister scurrying of rats in the 3
wormy partitions, and the creaking of hidden timbers in the centuried house, 3
were enough to give him a sense of strident pandemonium. The darkness always 3
teemed with unexplained sound - and yet he sometimes shook with fear lest the 3
noises he heard should subside and allow him to hear certain other fainter noises 3
which he suspected were lurking behind them. 3
3
He was in the changeless, legend-haunted city of Arkham, with its clustering 3
gambrel roofs that sway and sag over attics where witches hid from the King's 3
men in the dark, olden years of the Province. Nor was any spot in that city more 3
steeped in macabre memory than the gable room which harboured him - for it 3
was this house and this room which had likewise harboured old Keziah Mason, 3
whose flight from Salem Gaol at the last no one was ever able to explain. That 3
was in 1692 - the gaoler had gone mad and babbled of a small white-fanged furry 3
thing which scuttled out of Keziah's cell, and not even Cotton Mather could 3
explain the curves and angles smeared on the grey stone walls with some red, 3
sticky fluid. 3
3
Possibly Gilman ought not to have studied so hard. Non-Euclidean calculus and 3
quantum physics are enough to stretch any brain, and when one mixes them 3
with folklore, and tries to trace a strange background of multi-dimensional 3
reality behind the ghoulish hints of the Gothic tales and the wild whispers of the 3
chimney-corner, one can hardly expect to be wholly free from mental tension. 3
Gilman came from Haverhill, but it was only after he had entered college in 3
Arkham that he began to connect his mathematics with the fantastic legends of 3
elder magic. Something in the air of the hoary town worked obscurely on his 3
imagination. The professors at Miskatonic had urged him to slacken up, and had 3
voluntarily cut down his course at several points. Moreover, they had stopped 3
him from consulting the dubious old books on forbidden secrets that were kept 3
3
3
3
119 3
3
3
3
under lock and key in a vault at the university library. But all these precautions 3
came late in the day, so that Gilman had some terrible hints from the dreaded 3
Necronomicon of Abdul Alhazred, the fragmentary Book of Eibon, and the 3
suppressed Unaussprechlicken Kulten of von Junzt to correlate with his abstract 3
formulae on the properties of space and the linkage of dimensions known and 3
unknown. 3
3
He knew his room was in the old Witch-House - that, indeed, was why he had 3
taken it. There was much in the Essex County records about Keziah Mason's 3
trial, and what she had admitted under pressure to the Court of Oyer and 3
Terminer had fascinated Gilman beyond all reason. She had told Judge Hathorne 3
of lines and curves that could be made to point out directions leading through 3
the walls of space to other spaces beyond, and had implied that such lines and 3
curves were frequently used at certain midnight meetings in the dark valley of 3
the white stone beyond Meadow Hill and on the unpeopled island in the river. 3
She had spoken also of the Black Man, of her oath, and of her new secret name of 3
Nahab. Then she had drawn those devices on the walls of her cell and vanished. 3
3
Gilman believed strange things about Keziah, and had felt a queer thrill on 3
learning that her dwelling was still standing after more than two hundred and 3
thirty-five years. When he heard the hushed Arkham whispers about Keziah's 3
persistent presence in the old house and the narrow streets, about the irregular 3
human tooth-marks left on certain sleepers in that and other houses, about the 3
childish cries heard near May-Eve, and Hallowmass, about the stench often 3
noted in the old house's attic just after those dreaded seasons, and about the 3
small, furry, sharp-toothed thing which haunted the mouldering structure and 3
the town and nuzzled people curiously in the black hours before dawn, he 3
resolved to live in the place at any cost. A room was easy to secure, for the house 3
was unpopular, hard to rent, and long given over to cheap lodgings. Gilman 3
could not have told what he expected to find there, but he knew he wanted to be 3
in the building where some circumstance had more or less suddenly given a 3
mediocre old woman of the Seventeenth Century an insight into mathematical 3
depths perhaps beyond the utmost modern delvings of Planck, Heisenberg, 3
Einstein, and de Sitter. 3
3
He studied the timber and plaster walls for traces of cryptic designs at every 3
accessible spot where the paper had peeled, and within a week managed to get 3
the eastern attic room where Keziah was held to have practised her spells. It had 3
been vacant from the first - for no one had ever been willing to stay there long - 3
but the Polish landlord had grown wary about renting it. Yet nothing whatever 3
happened to Gilman till about the time of the fever. No ghostly Keziah flitted 3
through the sombre halls and chambers, no small furry thing crept into his 3
dismal eyrie to nuzzle him, and no record of the witch's incantations rewarded 3
3
3
3
120 3
3
3
3
his constant search. Sometimes he would take walks through shadowy tangles of 3
unpaved musty-smelling lanes where eldritch brown houses of unknown age 3
leaned and tottered and leered mockingly through narrow, small-paned 3
windows. Here he knew strange things had happened once, and there was a 3
faint suggestion behind the surface that everything of that monstrous past might 3
not - at least in the darkest, narrowest, and most intricately crooked alleys - have 3
utterly perished. He also rowed out twice to the ill-regarded island in the river, 3
and made a sketch of the singular angles described by the moss-grown rows of 3
grey standing stones whose origin was so obscure and immemorial. 3
3
Gilman's room was of good size but queerly irregular shape; the north wall 3
slating perceptibly inward from the outer to the inner end, while the low ceiling 3
slanted gently downward in the same direction. Aside from an obvious rat-hole 3
and the signs of other stopped-up ones, there was no access - nor any appearance 3
of a former avenue of access - to the space which must have existed between the 3
slanting wall and the straight outer wall on the house's north side, though a view 3
from the exterior showed where a window had heen boarded up at a very 3
remote date. The loft above the ceiling - which must have had a slanting floor - 3
was likewise inaccessible. When Gilman climbed up a ladder to the cob-webbed 3
level loft above the rest of the attic he found vestiges of a bygone aperture tightly 3
and heavily covered with ancient planking and secured by the stout wooden 3
pegs common in Colonial carpentry. No amount of persuasion, however, could 3
induce the stolid landlord to let him investigate either of these two closed spaces. 3
3
As time wore along, his absorption in the irregular wall and ceiling of his room 3
increased; for he began to read into the odd angles a mathematical significance 3
which seemed to offer vague clues regarding their purpose. Old Keziah, he 3
reflected, might have had excellent reasons for living in a room with peculiar 3
angles; for was it not through certain angles that she claimed to have gone 3
outside the boundaries of the world of space we know? His interest gradually 3
veered away from the unplumbed voids beyond the slanting surfaces, since it 3
now appeared that the purpose of those surfaces concerned the side he was on. 3
3
The touch of brain-fever and the dreams began early in February. For some time, 3
apparently, the curious angles of Gilman's room had been having a strange, 3
almost hypnotic effect on him; and as the bleak winter advanced he had found 3
himself staring more and more intently at the corner where the down- slanting 3
ceiling met the inward-slanting wall. About this period his inability to 3
concentrate on his formal studies worried him considerably, his apprehensions 3
about the mid-year examinations being very acute. But the exaggerated sense of 3
bearing was scarcely less annoying. Life had become an insistent and almost 3
unendurable cacophony, and there was that constant, terrifying impression of 3
other sounds - perhaps from regions beyond life - trembling on the very brink of 3
3
3
3
121 3
3
3
3
audibility. So far as concrete noises went, the rats in the ancient partitions were 3
the worst. Sometimes their scratching seemed not only furtive but deliberate. 3
When it came from beyond the slanting north wall it was mixed with a sort of 3
dry rattling; and when it came from the century-closed loft above the slanting 3
ceiling Gilman always braced himself as if expecting some horror which only 3
bided its time before descending to engulf him utterly. 3
3
The dreams were wholly beyond the pale of sanity, and Gilman fell that they 3
must be a result, jointly, of his studies in mathematics and in folklore. He had 3
been thinking too much about the vague regions which his formulae told him 3
must lie beyond the three dimensions we know, and about the possibility that 3
old Keziah Mason - guided by some influence past all conjecture - had actually 3
found the gate to those regions. The yellowed country records containing her 3
testimony and that of her accusers were so damnably suggestive of things 3
beyond human experience - and the descriptions of the darting little furry object 3
which served as her familiar were so painfully realistic despite their incredible 3
details. 3
3
That object - no larger than a good-sized rat and quaintly called by the 3
townspeople "Brown Jenkins - seemed to have been the fruit of a remarkable 3
case of sympathetic herd-delusion, for in 1692 no less than eleven persons had 3
testified to glimpsing it. There were recent rumours, too, with a baffling and 3
disconcerting amount of agreement. Witnesses said it had long hair and the 3
shape of a rat, but that its sharp-toothed, bearded face was evilly human while its 3
paws were like tiny human hands. It took messages betwixt old Keziah and the 3
devil, and was nursed on the witch's blood, which it sucked like a vampire. Its 3
voice was a kind of loathsome titter, and it could speak all languages. Of all the 3
bizarre monstrosities in Oilman's dreams, nothing filled him with greater panic 3
and nausea than this blasphemous and diminutive hybrid, whose image flitted 3
across his vision in a form a thousandfold more hateful than anything his waking 3
mind had deduced from the ancient records and the modern whispers. 3
3
Oilman's dreams consisted largely in plunges through limitless abysses of 3
inexplicably coloured twilight and baffingly disordered sound; abysses whose 3
material and gravitational properties, and whose relation to his own entity, he 3
could not even begin to explain. He did not walk or climb, fly or swim, crawl or 3
wriggle; yet always experienced a mode of motion partly voluntary and partly 3
involuntary. Of his own condition he could not well judge, for sight of his arms, 3
legs, and torso seemed always cut off by some odd disarrangement of 3
perspective; but he felt that his physical organization and faculties were 3
somehow marvellously transmuted and obliquely projected - though not without 3
a certain grotesque relationship to his normal proportions and properties. 3
3
3
3
122 3
3
3
3
The abysses were by no means vacant, being crowded with indescribably angled 3
masses of alien-hued substance, some of which appeared to be organic while 3
others seemed inorganic. A few of the organic objects tended to awake vague 3
memories in the back of his mind, though he could form no conscious idea of 3
what they mockingly resembled or suggested. In the later dreams he began to 3
distinguish separate categories into which the organic objects appeared to be 3
divided, and which seemed to involve in each case a radically different species of 3
conduct-pattern and basic motivation. Of these categories one seemed to him to 3
include objects slightly less illogical and irrelevant in their motions than the 3
members of the other categories. 3
3
All the objects - organic and inorganic alike - were totally beyond description or 3
even comprehension. Gilman sometimes compared the inorganic matter to 3
prisms, labyrinths, clusters of cubes and planes, and Cyclopean buildings; and 3
the organic things struck him variously as groups of bubbles, octopi, centipedes, 3
living Hindoo idols, and intricate arabesques roused into a kind of ophidian 3
animation. Everything he saw was unspeakably menacing and horrible; and 3
whenever one of the organic entities appeared by its motions to be noticing him, 3
he felt a stark, hideous fright which generally jolted him awake. Of how the 3
organic entities moved, he could tell no more than of how he moved himself. In 3
time he observed a further mystery - the tendency of certain entities to appear 3
suddenly out of empty space, or to disappear totally with equal suddenness. The 3
shrieking, roaring confusion of sound which permeated the abysses was past all 3
analysis as to pitch, timbre or rhythm; but seemed to be synchronous with vague 3
visual changes in all the indefinite objects, organic and inorganic alike. Gilman 3
had a constant sense of dread that it might rise to some unbearable degree of 3
intensity during one or another of its obscure, relentlessly inevitable fluctuations. 3
3
But it was not in these vortices of complete alienage that he saw Brown Jenkin. 3
That shocking little horror was reserved for certain lighter, sharper dreams 3
which assailed him just before he dropped into the fullest depths of sleep. He 3
would be lying in the dark fighting to keep awake when a faint lambent glow 3
would seem to shimmer around the centuried room, showing in a violet mist the 3
convergence of angled planes which had seized his brain so insidiously. The 3
horror would appear to pop out of the rat-hole in the corner and patter toward 3
him over the sagging, wide-planked floor with evil expectancy in its tiny, 3
bearded human face; but mercifully, this dream always melted away before the 3
object got close enough to nuzzle him. It had hellishly long, sharp, canine teeth; 3
Gilman tried to stop up the rat-hole every day, but each night the real tenants of 3
the partitions would gnaw away the obstruction, whatever it might be. Once he 3
had the landlord nail a tin over it, but the next night the rats gnawed a fresh hole, 3
in making which they pushed or dragged out into the room a curious little 3
fragment of bone. 3
3
3
3

3
3
3
Gilman did not report his fever to the doctor, for he knew he could not pass the 3
examinations if ordered to the college infirmary when every moment was 3
needed for cramming. As it was, he failed in Calculus D and Advanced General 3
Psychology, though not without hope of making up lost ground before the end 3
of the term. 3
3
It was in March when the fresh element entered his lighter preliminary 3
dreaming, and the nightmare shape of Brown Jenkin began to be companioned 3
by the nebulous blur which grew more and more to resemble a bent old woman. 3
This addition disturbed him more than he could account for, but finally he 3
decided that it was like an ancient crone whom he had twice actually 3
encountered in the dark tangle of lanes near the abandoned wharves. On those 3
occasions the evil, sardonic, and seemingly unmotivated stare of the beldame 3
had set him almost shivering - especially the first time when an overgrown rat 3
darting across the shadowed mouth of a neighbouring alley had made him think 3
irrationally of Brown Jenkin. Now, he reflected, those nervous fears were being 3
mirrored in his disordered dreams. That the influence of the old house was 3
unwholesome he could not deny, but traces of his early morbid interest still held 3
him there. He argued that the fever alone was responsible for his nightly 3
fantasies, and that when the touch abated he would be free from the monstrous 3
visions. Those visions, however, were of absorbing vividness and 3
convincingness, and whenever he awaked he retained a vague sense of having 3
undergone much more than he remembered. He was hideously sure that in 3
unrecalled dreams he had talked with both Brown Jenkin and the old woman, 3
and that they had been urging him to go somewhere with them and to meet a 3
third being of greater potency. 3
3
Toward the end of March he began to pick up in his mathematics, though the 3
other studies bothered him increasingly. He was getting an intuitive knack for 3
solving Riemannian equations, and astonished Professor Upham by his 3
comprehension of fourth-dimensional and other problems which had floored all 3
the rest of the class. One afternoon there was a discussion of possible freakish 3
curvatures in space, and of theoretical points of approach or even contact 3
between our part of the cosmos and various other regions as distant as the 3
farthest stars or the transgalactic gulfs themselves - or even as fabulously remote 3
as the tentatively conceivable cosmic units beyond the whole Einsteinian space- 3
time continuum. Oilman's handling of this theme filled everyone with 3
admiration, even though some of his hypothetical illustrations caused an 3
increase in the always plentiful gossip about his nervous and solitary 3
eccentricity. What made the students shake their heads was his sober theory that 3
a man might - given mathematical knowledge admittedly beyond all likelihood 3
of human acquirement - step deliberately from the earth to any other celestial 3
body which might lie at one of an infinity of specifc points in the cosmic pattern. 3
3
3
3
124 3
3
3
3
Such a step, he said, would require only two stages; first, a passage out of the 3
three-dimensional sphere we know, and second, a passage back to the three- 3
dimensional sphere at another point, perhaps one of infinite remoteness. That 3
this could be accomplished without loss of life was in many cases conceivable. 3
Any being from any part of three-dimensional space could probably survive in 3
the fourth dimension; and its survival of the second stage would depend upon 3
what alien part of three-dimensional space it might select for its re-entry. 3
Denizens of some planets might be able to live on certain others - even planets 3
belonging to other galaxies, or to similar dimensional phases of other space-time 3
continua - though of course there must be vast numbers of mutually 3
uninhabitable even though mathematically juxtaposed bodies or zones of space. 3
3
It was also possible that the inhabitants of a given dimensional realm could 3
survive entry to many unknown and incomprehensible realms of additional or 3
indefinitely multiplied dimensions - be they within or outside the given space- 3
time continuum - and that the converse would be likewise true. This was a 3
matter for speculation, though one could be fairly certain that the type of 3
mutation involved in a passage from any given dimensional plane to the next 3
higher one would not be destructive of biological integrity as we understand it. 3
Gilman could not be very clear about his reasons for this last assumption, but his 3
haziness here was more than overbalanced by his clearness on other complex 3
points. Professor Upham especially liked his demonstration of the kinship of 3
higher mathematics to certain phases of magical lore transmitted down the ages 3
from an ineffable antiquity - human or pre-human - whose knowledge of the 3
cosmos and its laws was greater than ours. 3
3
Around 1 April Gilman worried cosiderably because his slow fever did not 3
abate. He was also troubled by what some of his fellow lodgers said about his 3
sleep-walking. It seened that he was often absent from his bed and that the 3
creaking of his floor at certain hours of the night was remarked by the man in the 3
room below. This fellow also spoke of hearing the tread of shod feet in the night; 3
but Gilman was sure he must have been mistaken in this, since shoes as well as 3
other apparel were always precisely in place in the morning. One could develop 3
all sorts of aural delusions in this morbid old house - for did not Gilman himself, 3
even in daylight, now feel certain that noises other than rat-scratching came from 3
the black voids beyond the slanting wall and above the slanting ceiling? His 3
pathologically sensitive ears began to listen for faint footfalls in the 3
immemorially sealed loft overhead, and sometimes the illusion of such things 3
was agonizingly realistic. 3
3
However, he knew that he had actually become a somnambulist; for twice at 3
night his room had been found vacant, though with all his clothing in place. Of 3
this he had been assured by Frank Elwood, the one fellow-student whose 3
3
3
3
125 3
3
3
3
poverty forced him to room in this squahd and unpopular house. Elwood had 3
been studying in the small hours and had come up for help on a differential 3
equation, only to find Gilman absent. It had been rather presumptuous of him to 3
open the unlocked door after knocking had failed to rouse a response, but he had 3
needed the help very badly and thought that his host would not mind a gentle 3
prodding awake. On neither occasion, though, had Gilman been there; and when 3
told of the matter he wondered where he could have been wandering, barefoot 3
and with only his night clothes on. He resolved to investigate the matter if 3
reports of his sleep-walking continued, and thought of sprinkling flour on the 3
floor of the corridor to see where his footsteps might lead. The door was the only 3
conceivable egress, for there was no possible foothold outside the narrow 3
window. 3
3
As April advanced. Oilman's fever-sharpened ears were disturbed by the 3
whining prayers of a superstitious loom-fixer named Joe Mazurewicz who had a 3
room on the ground floor. Mazurewicz had told long, rambling stories about the 3
ghost of old Keziah and the furry sharp-fanged, nuzzling thing, and had said he 3
was so badly haunted at times that only his silver crucifix - given him for the 3
purpose by Father Iwanicki of St. Stanislaus' Church - could bring him relief. 3
Now he was praying because the Witches' Sabbath was drawing near. May Eve 3
was Walpurgis Night, when hell's blackest evil roamed the earth and all the 3
slaves of Satan gathered for nameless rites and deeds. It was always a very bad 3
lime in Arkham, even though the fine folks up in Miskatonic Avenue and High 3
and Saltonstall Streets pretended to know nothing about it. There would be bad 3
doings, and a child or two would probably be missing. Joe knew about such 3
things, for his grandmother in the old country had heard tales from her 3
grandmother. It was wise to pray and count one's beads at this season. For three 3
months Keziah and Brown Jenkin had not been near Joe's room, nor near Paul 3
Choynski's room, nor anywhere else - and it meant no good when they held off 3
like that. They must be up to something. 3
3
Oilman dropped in at the doctor's office on the sixteenth of the month, and was 3
surprised to find his temperature was not as high as he had feared. The physician 3
questioned him sharply, and advised him to see a nerve specialist. On reflection, 3
he was glad he had not consulted the still more inquisitive college doctor. Old 3
Waldron, who had curtailed his activities before, would have made him take a 3
rest - an impossible thing now that he was so close to great results in his 3
equations. He was certainly near the boundary between the known universe and 3
the fourth dimension, and who could say how much farther he might go? 3
3
But even as these thoughts came to him he wondered at the source of his strange 3
confidence. Did all of this perilous sense of immininence come from the formulae 3
on the sheets he covered day by day? The soft, stealthy, imaginary footsteps in 3
3
3
3
126 3
3
3
3
the sealed loft above were unnerving. And now, too, there was a growing feeling 3
that somebody was constantly persuading him to do something terrible which he 3
could not do. How about the somnambulism? Where did he go sometimes in the 3
night? And what was that faint suggestion of sound which once in a while 3
seemed to trickle through the confusion of identifiable sounds even in broad 3
daylight and full wakefulness? Its rhythm did not correspond to anything on 3
earth, unless perhaps to the cadence of one or two unmentionable Sabbat-chants, 3
and sometimes he feared it corresponded to certain attributes of the vague 3
shrieking or roaring in those wholly alien abysses of dream. 3
3
The dreams were meanwhile getting to be atrocious. In the lighter preliminary 3
phase the evil old woman was now of fiendish distinctness, and Gilman knew 3
she was the one who had frightened him in the slums. Her bent back, long nose, 3
and shrivelled chin were unmistakable, and her shapeless brown garments were 3
like those he remembered. The expression on her face was one of hideous 3
malevolence and exultation, and when he awaked he could recall a croaking 3
voice that persuaded and threatened. He must meet the Black Man and go with 3
them all to the throne of Azathoth at the centre of ultimate chaos. That was what 3
she said. He must sign the book of Azathoth in his own blood and take a new 3
secret name now that his independent delvings had gone so far. What kept him 3
from going with her and Brown Jenkin and the other to the throne of Chaos 3
where the thin flutes pipe mindlessly was the fact that he had seen the name 3
"Azathoth" in the Necronomicon, and knew it stood for a primal evil too horrible 3
for description. 3
3
The old woman always appeared out of thin air near the corner where the 3
downward slant met the inward slant. She seemed to crystallize at a point closer 3
to the ceiling than to the floor, and every night she was a little nearer and more 3
distinct before the dream shifted. Brown Jenkin, too was always a little nearer at 3
the last, and its yellowish-white fangs glistened shockingly in that unearthly 3
violet phosphorescence. Its shrill loathsome tittering struck more and more into 3
Gilman's head, and he could remember in the morning how it had pronounced 3
the words "Azathoth" and "Nyarlathotep". 3
3
In the deeper dreams everything was likewise more distinct, and Gilman felt that 3
the twilight abysses around him were those of the fourth dimension. Those 3
organic entities whose motions seemed least flagrantly irrelevant and 3
unmotivated were probably projections of life-forms from our own planet, 3
including human beings. What the others were in their own dimensional sphere 3
or spheres he dared not try to think. Two of the less irrelevantly moving things - 3
a rather large congeries of iridescent, prolately spheroidal bubbles and a very 3
much smaller polyhedron of unknown colours and rapidly shifting surface 3
angles - seemed to take notice of him and follow him about or float ahead as he 3
3
3
3
127 3
3
3
3
changed position among the titan prisms, labyrinths, cube-and-plane clusters 3
and quasi-buildings; and all the while the vague shrieking and roaring waxed 3
louder and louder, as if approaching some monstrous climax of utterly 3
unendurable intensity. 3
3
During the night of 19-20 April the new development occurred. Gilman was half 3
involuntarily moving about in the twilight abysses with the bubble-mass and the 3
small polyhedron floating ahead when he noticed the peculiarly regular angles 3
formed by the edges of some gigantic neighbouring prism-clusters. In another 3
second he was out of the abyss and standing tremulously on a rocky hillside 3
bathed in intense, diffused green light. He was barefooted and in his 3
nightclothes. and when he tried to walk discovered that he could scarcely lift his 3
feet. A swirling vapour hid everything but the immediate sloping terrain from 3
sight, and he shrank from the thought of the sounds, that might surge out of that 3
vapour. 3
3
Then he saw the two shapes laboriously crawling toward him - the old woman 3
and the little furry thing. The crone strained up to her knees and managed to 3
cross her arms in a singular fashion, while Brown Jenkin pointed in a certain 3
direction with a horribly anthropoid forepaw which it raised with evident 3
difficulty. Spurred by an impulse he did not originate, Gilman dragged himself 3
forward along a course determined by the angle of the old woman's arms and 3
the direction of the small monstrosity's paw, and before he had shuffled three 3
steps he was back in the twilight abysses. Geometrical shapes seethed around 3
him, and he fell dizzily and interminably. At last he woke in his bed in the 3
crazily angled garret of the eldritch old house. 3
3
He was good for nothing that morning, and stayed away from all his classes. 3
Some unknown attraction was pulling his eyes in a seemingly irrelevant 3
direction, for he could not help staring at a certain vacant spot on the floor. As 3
the day advanced, the focus of his unseeing eyes changed position, and by noon 3
he had conquered the impulse to stare at vacancy. About two o'clock he went out 3
for lunch and as he threaded the narrow lanes of the city he found himself 3
turning always to the southeast. Only an effort halted him at a cafeteria in 3
Church Street, and after the meal he felt the unknown pull still more strongly. 3
3
He would have to consult a nerve specialist after all - perhaps there was a 3
connection with his somnambulism - but meanwhile he might at least try to 3
break the morbid spell himself. Undoubtedly he could still manage to walk away 3
from the pull, so with great resolution he headed against it and dragged himself 3
deliberately north along Garrison Street. By the time he had reached the bridge 3
over the Miskatonic he was in a cold perspiration, and he clutched at the iron 3
3
3
3
128 3
3
3
3
railing as he gazed upstream at the ill- regarded island whose regular lines of 3
ancient standing stones brooded sullenly in the afternoon sunlight. 3
3
Then he gave a start. For there was a clearly visible living figure on that desolate 3
island, and a second glance told him it was certainly the strange old woman 3
whose sinister aspect had worked itself so disastrously into his dreams. The tall 3
grass near her was moving, too, as if some other living thing were crawling close 3
to the ground. When the old woman began to turn toward him he fled 3
precipitately off the bridge and into the shelter of the town's labyrinthine 3
waterfront alleys. Distant though the island was, he felt that a monstrous and 3
invincible evil could flow from the sardonic stare of that bent, ancient figure in 3
brown. 3
3
The southeastwards pull still held, and only with tremendous resolution could 3
Gilman drag himself into the old house and up the rickety stairs. For hours he sat 3
silent and aimless, with his eyes shifting gradually westward. About six o'clock 3
his sharpened ears caught the whining prayers of Joe Mazurewicz two floors 3
below, and in desperation he seized his hat and walked out into the sunset- 3
golden streets, letting the now directly southward pull carry him where it might. 3
An hour later darkness found him in the open fields beyond Hangman's Brook, 3
with the glimmering spring stars shining ahead. The urge to walk was gradually 3
changing to an urge to leap mystically into space, and suddenly he realized just 3
where the source of the pull lay. 3
3
It was in the sky. A definite point among the stars had a claim on him and was 3
calling him. Apparently it was a point somewhere between Hydra and Argo 3
Navis, and he knew that he had been urged toward it ever since he had awaked 3
soon after dawn. In the morning it had been underfoot, and now it was roughly 3
south but stealing toward the west. What was the meaning of this new thing? 3
Was he going mad? How long would it last? Again mustering his resolution, 3
Gilman turned and dragged himself back to the sinister old house. 3
3
Mazurewicz was waiting for him at the door, and seemed both anxious and 3
reluctant to whisper some fresh bit of superstition. It was about the witch-light. 3
Joe had been out celebrating the night before - and it was Patriots' Day in 3
Massachusetts - and had come home after midnight. Looking up at the house 3
from outside, he had thought at first that Oilman's window was dark, but then 3
he had seen the faint violet glow within. He wanted to warn the gentleman about 3
that glow, for everybody in Arkham knew it was Keziah's witch-light which 3
played near Brown Jenkin and the ghost of the old crone herself. He had not 3
mentioned this before, but now he must tell about it because it meant that Keziah 3
and her long-toothed familiar were haunting the young gentleman. Sometimes 3
he and Paul Choynski and Landlord Dombrowski thought they saw that light 3
3
3
3
129 3
3
3
3
seeping out of cracks in the sealed loft above the young gentleman's room, but 3
they had all agreed not to talk about that. However, it would be better for the 3
gentleman to take another room and get a crucifix from some good priest like 3
Father Iwanicki. 3
3
As the man rambled on, Gilman felt a nameless panic clutch at his throat. He 3
knew that Joe must have been half drunk when he came home the night before; 3
yet the mention of a violet light in the garret window was of frightful import. It 3
was a lambent glow of this sort which always played about the old woman and 3
the small furry thing in those lighter, sharper dreams which prefaced his plunge 3
into unknown abysses, and the thought that a wakeful second person could see 3
the dream-luminance was utterly beyond sane harborage. Yet where had the 3
fellow got such an odd notion? Had he himself talked as well as walked around 3
the house in his sleep? No, Joe said, he had not - but he must check up on this. 3
Perhaps Frank Elwood could tell him something, though he hated to ask. 3
3
Fever - wild dreams - somnambulism - illusions of sounds - a pull toward a point 3
in the sky - and now a suspicion of insane sleep-talking! He must stop studying, 3
see a nerve specialist, and take himself in hand. When he climbed to the second 3
storey he paused at Elwood's door but saw that the other youth was out. 3
Reluctantly he continued up to his garret room and sat down in the dark. His 3
gaze was still pulled to the southward, but he also found himself listening 3
intently for some sound in the closed loft above, and half imagining that an evil 3
violet light seeped down through an infinitesimal crack in the low, slanting 3
ceiling. 3
3
That night as Gilman slept, the violet light broke upon him with heightened 3
intensity, and the old witch and small furry thing, getting closer than ever before, 3
mocked him with inhuman squeals and devilish gestures. He was glad to sink 3
into the vaguely roaring twilight abysses, though the pursuit of that iridescent 3
bubble-congeries and that kaleidoscopic little polyhedron was menacing and 3
irritating. Then came the shift as vast converging planes of a slippery-looking 3
substance loomed above and below him - a shift which ended in a flash of 3
delirium and a blaze of unknown, alien light in which yellow, carmine, and 3
indigo were madly and inextricably blended. 3
3
He was half lying on a high, fantastically balustraded terrace above a boundless 3
jungle of outlandish, incredible peaks, balanced planes, domes, minarets, 3
horizontal disks poised on pinnacles, and numberless forms of still greater 3
wildness - some of stone and some of metal - which glittered gorgeously in the 3
mixed, almost blistering glare from a poly-chromatic sky. Looking upward he 3
saw three stupendous disks of flame, each of a different hue, and at a different 3
height above an infinitely distant curving horizon of low mountains. Behind him 3
3
3
3
130 3
3
3
3
tiers of higher terraces towered aloft as far as he could see. The city below 3
stretched away to the limits of vision, and he hoped that no sound would well up 3
from it. 3
3
The pavement from which he easily raised himself was a veined polished stone 3
beyond his power to identify, and the tiles were cut in bizarre-angled shapes 3
which struck himm as less asymmetrical than based on some unearthly 3
symmetry whose laws he could not comprehend. The balustrade was chest-high, 3
delicate, and fantastically wrought, while along the rail were ranged at short 3
intervals little figures of grotesque design and exquisite workmanship. They, like 3
the whole balustrade, seemed to be made of some sort of shining metal whose 3
colour could not be guessed in the chaos of mixed effulgences, and their nature 3
utterly defied conjecture. They represented some ridged barrel-shaped objects 3
with thin horizontal arms radiating spoke-like from a central ring and with 3
vertical knobs or bulbs projecting from the head and base of the barrel. Each of 3
these knobs was the hub of a system of five long, flat, triangularly tapering arms 3
arranged around it like the arms of a starfish - nearly horizontal, but curving 3
slightly away from the central barrel. The base of the bottom knob was fused to 3
the long railing with so delicate a point of contact that several figures had been 3
broken off and were missing. The figures were about four and a half inches in 3
height, while the spiky arms gave them a maximum diameter of about two and a 3
half inches. 3
3
When Gilman stood up, the tiles felt hot to his bare feet. He was wholly alone, 3
and his first act was to walk to the balustrade and look dizzily down at the 3
endless, Cyclopean city almost two thousand feet below. As he listened he 3
thought a rhythmic confusion of faint musical pipings covering a wide tonal 3
range welled up from the narrow streets beneath, and he wished he might 3
discern the denizens of the place. The sight turned him giddy after a while, so 3
that he would have fallen to the pavement had he not clutched instinctively at 3
the lustrous balustrade. His right hand fell on one of the projecting figures, the 3
touch seeming to steady him slightly. It was too much, however, for the exotic 3
delicacy of the metal- work, and the spiky figure snapped off under his grasp. 3
Still half dazed, he continued to clutch it as his other hand seized a vacant space 3
on the smooth railing. 3
3
But now his over-sensitive ears caught something behind him, and he looked 3
back across the level terrace. Approaching him softly though without apparent 3
furtiveness were five figures, two of which were the sinister old woman and the 3
fanged, furry little animal. The other three were what sent him unconscious; for 3
they were living entities about eight feet high, shaped precisely like the spiky 3
images on the balustrade, and propelling themselves by a spider-like wriggling 3
of their lower set of starfish-arms. 3
3
3
3
131 3
3
3
3
Gilman awoke in his bed, drenched by a cold perspiration and with a smarting 3
sensation in his face, hands and feet. Springing to the floor, he washed and 3
dressed in frantic haste, as if it were necessary for him to get out of the house as 3
quickly as possible. He did not know where he wished to go, but felt that once 3
more he would have to sacrifice his classes. The odd pull toward that spot in the 3
sky between Hydra and Argo had abated, but another of even greater strength 3
had taken its place. Now he felt that he must go north - infinitely north. He 3
dreaded to cross the bridge that gave a view of the desolate island in the 3
Miskatonic, so went over the Peabody Avenue bridge. Very often he stumbled, 3
for his eyes and ears were chained to an extremely lofty point in the blank blue 3
sky. 3
3
After about an hour he got himself under better control, and saw that he was far 3
from the city. All around him stretched the bleak emptiness of salt marshes, 3
while the narrow road ahead led to Innsmouth - that ancient, half-deserted town 3
which Arkham people were so curiously unwilling to visit. Though the 3
northward pull had not diminished, he resisted it as he had resisted the other 3
pull, and finally found that he could almost balance the one against the other. 3
Plodding back to town and getting some coffee at a soda fountain, he dragged 3
himself into the public library and browsed aimlessly among the lighter 3
magazines. Once he met some friends who remarked how oddly sunburned he 3
looked, but he did not tell them of his walk. At three o'clock he took some lunch 3
at a restaurant, noting meanwhile that the pull had either lessened or divided 3
itself. After that he killed the time at a cheap cinema show, seeing the inane 3
performance over and over again without paying any attention to it. 3
3
About nine at night he drifted homeward and shuffled into the ancient house. 3
Joe Mazurewicz was whining unintelligible prayers, and Gilman hastened up to 3
his own garret chamber without pausing to see if Elwood was in. It was when he 3
turned on the feeble electric light that the shock came. At once he saw there was 3
something on the table which did not belong there, and a second look left no 3
room for doubt. Lying on its side - for it could not stand up alone - was the exotic 3
spiky figure which in his monstrous dream he had broken off the fantastic 3
balustrade. No detail was missing. The ridged, barrel-shaped center, the thin 3
radiating arms, the knobs at each end, and the flat, slightly outward-curving 3
starfish-arms spreading from those knobs - all were there. In the electric light the 3
colour seemed to be a kind of iridescent grey veined with green; and Gilman 3
could see amidst his horror and bewilderment that one of the knobs ended in a 3
jagged break, corresponding to its former point of attachment to the dream- 3
railing. 3
3
Only his tendency toward a dazed stupor prevented him from screaming aloud. 3
This fusion of dream and reality was too much to bear. Still dazed, he clutched at 3
3
3
3
132 3
3
3
3
the spiky thing and staggered downstairs to Landlord Dombrowski's quarters. 3
The whining prayers of the superstitious loom-fixer were still sounding through 3
the mouldy halls, but Gilman did not mind them now. The landlord was in, and 3
greeted him pleasantly. No, he had not seen that thing before and did not know 3
anything about it. But his wife had said she found a funny tin thing in one of the 3
beds when she fixed the rooms at noon, and maybe that was it. Dombrowski 3
called her, and she waddled in. Yes, that was the thing. She had found it in the 3
young gentleman's bed - on the side next the wall. It had looked very queer to 3
her, but of course the young gentleman had lots of queer things in his room - 3
books and curios and pictures and markings on paper. She certainly knew 3
nothing about it. 3
3
So Gilman climbed upstairs again in mental turmoil, convinced that he was 3
either still dreaming or that his somnambulism had run to incredible extremes 3
and led him to depredations in unknown places. Where had he got this outre 3
thing? He did not recall seeing it in any museum in Arkham. It must have been 3
somewhere, though; and the sight of it as he snatched it in his sleep must have 3
caused the odd dream- picture of the balustraded terrace. Next day he would 3
make some very guarded inquiries - and perhaps see the nerve specialist. 3
3
Meanwhile he would try to keep track of his somnambulism. As he went 3
upstairs and across the garret hall he sprinkled about some flour which he had 3
borrowed - with a frank admission as to its purpose - from the landlord. He had 3
stopped at Elwood's door on the way, but had found all dark within. Entering 3
his room, he placed the spiky thing on the table, and lay down in complete 3
mental and physical exhaustion without pausing to undress. From the closed loft 3
above the slating ceiling he thought he heard a faint scratching and padding, but 3
he was too disorganized even to mind it. That cryptical pull from the north was 3
getting very strong again, though it seemed now to come from a lower place in 3
the sky. 3
3
In the dazzling violet light of dream the old woman and the fanged, furry thing 3
came again and with a greater distinctness than on any former occasion. This 3
time they actually reached him, and he felt the crone's withered claws clutching 3
at him. He was pulled out of bed and into empty space, and for a moment he 3
heard a rhythmic roaring and saw the twilight amorphousness of the vague 3
abysses seething around him. But that moment was very brief, for presently he 3
was in a crude, windowless little space with rough beams and planks rising to a 3
peak just above his head, and with a curious slanting floor underfoot. Propped 3
level on that floor were low cases full of books of every degree of antiquity and 3
disintegration, and in the centre were a table and bench, both apparently 3
fastened in place. Small objects of unknown shape and nature were ranged on 3
the tops of the cases, and in the flaming violet light Gilman thought he saw a 3
3
3
3
133 3
3
3
3
counterpart of the spiky image which had puzzled him so horribly. On the left 3
the floor fell abruptly away, leaving a black triangular gulf out of which, after a 3
second's dry rattling, there presently climbed the hateful little furry thing with 3
the yellow fangs and bearded human face. 3
3
The evilly-grinning beldame still clutched him, and beyond the table stood a 3
figure he had never seen before - a tall, lean man of dead black colouration but 3
without the slightest sign of negroid features: wholly devoid of either hair or 3
beard, and wearing as his only garment a shapeless robe of some heavy black 3
fabric. His feet were indistinguishable because of the table and bench, but he 3
must have been shod, since there was a clicking whenever he changed position. 3
The man did not speak, and bore no trace of expression on his small, regular 3
features. He merely pointed to a book of prodigious size which lay open on the 3
table, while the beldame thrust a huge grey quill into Gilman's right hand. Over 3
everything was a pall of intensely maddening fear, and the climax was reached 3
when the furry thing ran up the dreamer's clothing to his shoulders and then 3
down his left arm, finally biting him sharply in the wrist just below his cuff. As 3
the blood spurted from this wound Gilman lapsed into a faint. 3
3
He awaked on the morning of the twenty-second with a pain in his left wrist, and 3
saw that his cuff was brown with dried blood. His recollections were very 3
confused, but the scene with the black man in the unknown space stood out 3
vividly. The rats must have bitten him as he slept, giving rise to the climax of that 3
frightful dream. Opening the door, he saw that the flour on the corridor floor 3
was undisturbed except for the huge prints of the loutish fellow who roomed at 3
the other end of the garret. So he had not been sleep-walking this time. But 3
something would have to be done about those rats. He would speak to the 3
landlord about them. Again he tried to stop up the hole at the base of the slanting 3
wall, wedging in a candlestick which seemed of about the right size. His ears 3
were ringing horribly, as if with the residual echoes of some horrible noise heard 3
in dreams. 3
3
As he bathed and changed clothes he tried to recall what he had dreamed after 3
the scene in the violet-litten space, but nothing definite would crystallize in his 3
mind. That scene itself must have corresponded to the sealed loft overhead, 3
which had begun to attack his imagination so violently, but later impressions 3
were faint and hazy. There were suggestions of the vague, twilight abysses, and 3
of still vaster, blacker abysses beyond them - abysses in which all fixed 3
suggestions were absent. He had been taken there by the bubble- congeries and 3
the little polyhedron which always dogged him; but they, like himself, had 3
changed to wisps of mist in this farther void of ultimate blackness. Something 3
else had gone on ahead - a larger wisp which now and then condensed into 3
nameless approximations of form - and he thought that their progress had not 3
3
3
3
134 3
3
3
3
been in a straight line, but rather along the alien curves and spirals of some 3
ethereal vortex which obeyed laws unknown to the physics and mathematics of 3
any conceivable cosmos. Eventually there had been a hint of vast, leaping 3
shadows, of a monstrous, half-acoustic pulsing, and of the thin, monotonous 3
piping of an unseen flute - but that was all. Gilman decided he had picked up 3
that last conception from what he had read in the Necronomicon about the 3
mindless entity Azathoth, which rules all time and space from a black throne at 3
the centre of Chaos. 3
3
When the blood was washed away the wrist wound proved very slight, and 3
Gilman puzzled over the location of the two tiny punctures. It occurred to him 3
that there was no blood on the bedspread where he had lain - which was very 3
curious in view of the amount on his skin and cuff. Had he been sleep-walking 3
within his room, and had the rat bitten him as he sat in some chair or paused in 3
some less rational position? He looked in every corner for brownish drops or 3
stains, but did not find any. He had better, he thought, spinkle flour within the 3
room as well as outside the door - though after all no further proof of his sleep- 3
walking was needed. He knew he did walk and the thing to do now was to stop 3
it. He must ask Frank Elwood for help. This morning the strange pulls from 3
space seemed lessened, though they were replaced by another sensation even 3
more inexplicable. It was a vague, insistent impulse to fly away from his present 3
situation, but held not a hint of the specific direction in which he wished to fly. 3
As he picked up the strange spiky image on the table he thought the older 3
northward pull grew a trifle stronger; but even so, it was wholly overruled by 3
the newer and more bewildering urge. 3
3
He took the spiky image down to Elwood's room, steeling himself against the 3
whines of the loom-fixer which welled up from the ground floor. Elwood was in, 3
thank heaven, and appeared to be stirring about. There was time for a little 3
conversation before leaving for breakfast and college, so Gilman hurriedly 3
poured forth an account of his recent dreams and fears. His host was very 3
sympathetic, and agreed that something ought to be done. He was shocked by 3
his guest's drawn, haggard aspect, and noticed the queer, abnormal-looking 3
sunburn which others had remarked during the past week. 3
3
There was not much, though, that he could say. He had not seen Gilman on any 3
sleep-walking expedition, and had no idea what the curious image could be. He 3
had, though, heard the French-Canadian who lodged just under Gilman talking 3
to Mazurewicz one evening. They were telling each other how badly they 3
dreaded the coming of Walpurgis Night, now only a few days off; and were 3
exchanging pitying comments about the poor, doomed young gentleman. 3
Desrochers, the fellow under Gilman's room, had spoken of nocturnal footsteps 3
shod and unshod, and of the violet light he saw one night when he had stolen 3
3
3
3
135 3
3
3
3
fearfully up to peer through Gilman's keyhole. He had not dared to peer, he told 3
Mazurewicz, after he had glimpsed that light through the cracks around the 3
door. There had been soft talking, too - and as he began to describe it his voice 3
had sunk to an inaudible whisper. 3
3
Elwood could not imagine what had set these superstitious creatures gossiping, 3
but supposed their imaginations had been roused by Gilman's late hours and 3
somnolent walking and talking on the one hand, and by the nearness of 3
traditionally-feared May Eve on the other hand. That Oilman talked in his sleep 3
was plain, and it was obviously from Desrochers' keyhole listenings that the 3
delusive notion of the violet dream-light had got abroad. These simple people 3
were quick to imagine they had seen any odd thing they had heard about. As for 3
a plan of action - Gilman had better move down to Elwood's room and avoid 3
sleeping alone. Elwood would, if awake, rouse him whenever he began to talk or 3
rise in his sleep. Very soon, too, he must see the specialist. Meanwhile they 3
would take the spiky image around to the various museums and to certain 3
professors; seeking identification and slating that it had been found in a public 3
rubbish-can. Also, Dombrowski must attend to the poisoning of those rats in the 3
walls. 3
3
Braced up by Elwood's companionship, Gilman attended classes that day. 3
Strange urges still tugged at him, but he could sidetrack them with considerable 3
success. During a free period he showed the queer image to several professors, 3
all of whom were intensely interested, though none of them could shed any light 3
upon its nature or origin. That night he slept on a couch which Elwood had had 3
the landlord bring to the second-storey room, and for the first time in weeks was 3
wholly free from disquieting dreams. But the feverishness still hung on, and the 3
whines of the loom-fixer were an unnerving influence. 3
3
During the next few days Gilman enjoyed an almost perfect immunity from 3
morbid manifestations. He had, Elwood said, showed no tendency to talk or rise 3
in his sleep; and meanwhile the landlord was putting rat-poison everywhere. 3
The only disturbing element was the talk among the superstitious foreigners, 3
whose imaginations had become highly excited. Mazurewicz was always trying 3
to make him get a crucifix, and finally forced one upon him which he said had 3
been blessed by the good Father Iwanicki. Desrochers, too, had something to say; 3
in fact, he insisted that cautious steps had sounded in the now vacant room 3
above him on the first and second nights of Gilinan's absence from it. Paul 3
Choynski thought he heard sounds in the halls and on the stairs at night, and 3
claimed that his door had been softly tried, while Mrs. Dombrowski vowed she 3
had seen Brown Jenkin for the first time since All-Hallows. But such naive 3
reports could mean very little, and Gilman let the cheap metal crucifix hang idly 3
from a knob on his host's dresser. 3
3
3
3
136 3
3
3
3
For three days Gilman and Elwood canvassed the local museums in an effort to 3
identify the strange spiky image, but always without success. In every quarter, 3
however, interest was intense; for the utter alienage of the thing was a 3
tremendous challenge to scientific curiosity. One of the small radiating arms was 3
broken off and subjected to chemical analysis. Professor Ellery found platinum, 3
iron and tellurium in the strange alloy; but mixed with these were at least three 3
other apparent elements of high atomic weight which chemistry was absolutely 3
powerless to classify. Not only did they fail to correspond with any known 3
element, but they did not even fit the vacant places reserved for probable 3
elements in the periodic system. The mystery remains unsolved to this day, 3
though the image is on exhibition at the museum of Miskatonic University. 3
3
On the morning of April twenty-seventh a fresh rat-bole appeared in the room 3
where Gilman was a guest, but Dombrowski tinned it up during the day. The 3
poison was not having much effect, for scratchings and scurryings in the walls 3
were virtually undiminished. 3
3
Elwood was out late that night, and Gilman waited up for him. He did not wish 3
to go to sleep in a room alone - especially since he thought he had glimpsed in 3
the evening twilight the repellent old woman whose image had become so 3
horribly transferred to his dreams. He wondered who she was, and what had 3
been near her rattling the tin can in a rubbish-heap at the mouth of a squalid 3
courtyard. The crone had seemed to notice him and leer evilly at him - though 3
perhaps this was merely his imagination. 3
3
The next day both youths felt very tired, and knew they would sleep like logs 3
when night came. In the evening they drowsily discussed the mathematical 3
studies which had so completely and perhaps harmfully engrossed Gilman, and 3
speculated about the linkage with ancient magic and folklore which seemed so 3
darkly probable. They spoke of old Keziah Mason, and Elwood agreed that 3
Gilman had good scientific grounds for thinking she might have stumbled on 3
strange and significant information. The hidden cults to which these witches 3
belonged often guarded and handed down surprising secrets from elder, 3
forgotten eons; and it was by no means impossible that Keziah had actually 3
mastered the art of passing through dimensional gates. Tradition emphasizes the 3
uselessness of material barriers in halting a witch's notions, and who can say 3
what underlies the old tales of broomstick rides through the night? 3
3
Whether a modern student could ever gain similar powers from mathematical 3
research alone, was still to be seen. Suceess, Gilman added, might lead to 3
dangerous and unthinkable situations, for who could foretell the conditions 3
pervading an adjacent but normally inaccessible dimension? On the other hand, 3
the picturesque possibilities were enormous. Time could not exist in certain belts 3
3
3
3
137 3
3
3
3
of space, and by entering and remaining in such a belt one might preserve one's 3
hfe and age indefinitely; never suffering organic metabolism or deterioration 3
except for slight amounts incurred during visits to one's own or similar planes. 3
One might, for example, pass into a timeless dimension and emerge at some 3
remote period of the earth's history as young as before. 3
3
Whether anybody had ever managed to do this, one could hardly conjecture with 3
any degree of authority. Old legends are hazy and ambiguous, and in historic 3
times all attempts at crossing forbidden gaps seem complicated by strange and 3
terrible alliances with beings and messengers from outside. There was the 3
immemorial figure of the deputy or messenger of hidden and terrible powers - 3
the "Black Man" of the witch-cult, and the "Nyarlathotep" of the Necronomicon. 3
There was, too, the baffling problem of the lesser messengers or intermediaries - 3
the quasi-animals and queer hybrids which legend depicts as witches' familiars. 3
As Oilman and Elwood retired, too sleepy to argue further, they heard Joe 3
Mazurewicz reel into the house half drunk, and shuddered at the desperate 3
wildness of his whining prayers. 3
3
That night Oilman saw the violet light again. In his dream he had heard a 3
scratching and gnawing in the partitions, and thought that someone fumbled 3
clumsily at the latch. Then he saw the old woman and the small furry thing 3
advancing toward him over the carpeted floor. The beldame's face was alight 3
with inhuman exultation, and the little yellow-toothed morbidity tittered 3
mockingly as it pointed at the heavily- sleeping form of Elwood on the other 3
couch across the room. A paralysis of fear stifled all attempts to cry out. As once 3
before, the hideous crone seized Oilman by the shoulders, yanking him out of 3
bed and into empty space. Again the infinitude of the shrieking abysses flashed 3
past him, but in another second he thought he was in a dark, muddy, unknown 3
alley of foetid odors with the rotting walls of ancient houses towering up on 3
every hand. 3
3
Ahead was the robed black man he had seen in the peaked space in the other 3
dream, while from a lesser distance the old woman was beckoning and 3
grimacing imperiously. Brown Jenkin was rubbing itself with a kind of 3
affectionate playfulness around the ankles of the black man, which the deep mud 3
largely concealed. There was a dark open doorway on the right, to which the 3
black man silently pointed. Into this the grinning crone started, dragging Oilman 3
after her by his pajama sleeves. There were evil-smelling staircases which 3
creaked ominously, and on which the old woman seemed to radiate a faint violet 3
light; and finally a door leading off a landing. The crone fumbled with the latch 3
and pushed the door open, motioning to Oilman to wait, and disappearing inside 3
the black aperture. 3
3
3
3
138 3
3
3
3
The youth's over-sensitive ears caught a hideous strangled cry, and presently the 3
beldame came out of the room bearing a small, senseless form which she thrust 3
at the dreamer as if ordering him to carry it. The sight of this form, and the 3
expression on its face, broke the spell. Still too dazed to cry out, he plunged 3
recklessly down the noisome staircase and into the mud outside, halting only 3
when seized and choked by the waiting black man. As consciousness departed 3
he heard the faint, shrill tittering of the fanged, rat-like abnormality. 3
3
On the morning of the twenty-ninth Gilman awaked into a maelstrom of horror. 3
The instant he opened his eyes he knew something was terribly wrong, for he 3
was back in his old garret room with the slanting wall and ceiling, sprawled on 3
the now unmade bed. His throat was aching inexplicably, and as he struggled to 3
a sitting posture he saw with growing fright that his feet and pajama bottoms 3
were brown with caked mud. For the moment his recollections were hopelessly 3
hazy, but he knew at least that he must have been sleep-walking. Elwood had 3
been lost too deeply in slumber to hear and stop him. On the floor were confused 3
muddy prints, but oddly enough they did not extend all the way to the door. The 3
more Gilman looked at them, the more peculiar they seemed; for in addition to 3
those he could recognize as his there were some smaller, almost round markings 3
- such as the legs of a large chair or a table might make, except that most of them 3
tended to be divided into halves. There were also some curious muddy rat-tracks 3
leading out of a fresh hole and back into it again. Utter bewilderment and the 3
fear of madness racked Gilman as he staggered to the door and saw that there 3
were no muddy prints outside. The more he remembered of his hideous dream 3
the more terrified he felt, and it added to his desperation to hear Joe Mazurewicz 3
chanting mournfully two floors below. 3
3
Descending to Elwood's room he roused his still-sleeping host and began telling 3
of how he had found himself, but Elwood could form no idea of what might 3
really have happened. Where Gilman could have been, how he got back to his 3
room without making tracks in the hall, and how the muddy, furniture-like 3
prints came to be mixed with his in the garret chamber, were wholly beyond 3
conjecture. Then there were those dark, livid marks on his throat, as if he had 3
tried to strangle himself. He put his hands up to them, but found that they did 3
not even approximately fit. While they were talking, Desrochers dropped in to 3
say that he had heard a terrific clattering overhead in the dark small hours. No, 3
there had been no one on the stairs after midnight, though just before midnight 3
he had heard faint footfalls in the garret, and cautiously descending steps he did 3
not like. It was, he added, a very bad time of year for Arkham. The young 3
gentleman had better be sure to wear the circifix Joe Mazurewicz had given him. 3
Even the daytime was not safe, for after dawn there had been strange sounds in 3
the house - especially a thin, childish wail hastily choked off. 3
3
3
3
139 3
3
3
3
Gilman mechanically attended classes that morning, but was wholly unable to fix 3
his mind on his studies. A mood of hideous apprehension and expectancy had 3
seized him, and he seemed to be awaiting the fall of some annihilating blow. At 3
noon he lunched at the University spa, picking up a paper from the next seat as 3
he waited for dessert. But he never ate that dessert; for an item on the paper's 3
first page left him limp, wild-eyed, and able only to pay his check and stagger 3
back to Elwood's room. 3
3
There had been a strange kidnapping the night before in Orne's Gangway, and 3
the two-year-old child of a clod-like laundry worker named Anastasia Wolejko 3
had completely vanished from sight. The mother, it appeared, had feared the 3
event for some time; but the reasons she assigned for her fear were so grotesque 3
that no one took them seriously. She had, she said, seen Brown Jenkin about the 3
place now and then ever since early in March, and knew from its grimaces and 3
titterings that little Ladislas must be marked for sacrifice at the awful Sabbat on 3
Walpurgis Night. She had asked her neighbour Mary Czanek to sleep in the 3
room and try to protect the child, but Mary had not dared. She could not tell the 3
police, for they never believed such things. Children had been taken that way 3
every year ever since she could remember. And her friend Pete Stowacki would 3
not help because he wanted the child out of the way. 3
3
But what threw Gilman into a cold perspiration was the report of a pair of 3
revellers who had been walking past the mouth of the gangway just after 3
midnight. They admitted they had been drunk, but both vowed they had seen a 3
crazily dressed trio furtively entering the dark passageway. There had, they said, 3
been a huge robed negro, a little old woman in rags, and a young white man in 3
his night-clothes. The old woman had been dragging the youth, while around the 3
feet of the negro a tame rat was rubbing and weaving in the brown mud. 3
3
Gilman sat in a daze all the afternoon, and Elwood - who had meanwhile seen 3
the papers and formed terrible conjectures from them - found him thus when he 3
came home. This time neither could doubt but that something hideously serious 3
was closing in around them. Between the phantasms of nightmare and the 3
realities of the objective world a monstrous and unthinkable relationship was 3
crystallizing, and only stupendous vigilance could avert still more direful 3
developments. Gilman must see a specialist sooner or later, but not just now, 3
when all the papers were full of this kidnapping business. 3
3
Just what had really happened was maddeningly obscure, and for a moment 3
both Gilman and Elwood exchanged whispered theories of the wildest kind. Had 3
Gilman unconsciously succeeded better than he knew in his studies of space and 3
its dimensions? Had he actually slipped outside our sphere to points unguessed 3
and unimaginable? Where - if anywhere - had he been on those nights of 3
3
3
3
140 3
3
3
3
demoniac alienage? The roaring twilight abysses - the green hillside - the 3
blistering terrace - the pulls from the stars - the ultimate black vortex - the black 3
man - the muddy alley and the stairs - the old witch and the fanged, furry horror 3
3
- the bubble-congeries and the little polyhedron - the strange sunburn - the wrist- 3
wound - the unexplained image - the muddy feet - the throat marks - the tales 3
and fears of the superstitious foreigners - what did all this mean? To what extent 3
could the laws of sanity apply to such a case? 3
3
There was no sleep for either of them that night, but next day they both cut 3
classes and drowsed. This was April thirtieth, and with the dusk would come the 3
hellish Sabbat-time which all the foreigners and the superstitious old folk feared. 3
Mazurewicz came home at six o'clock and said people at the mill were 3
whispering that the Walpurgis revels would be held in the dark ravine beyond 3
Meadow Hill where the old white stone stands in a place queerly devoid of all 3
plant-life. Some of them had even told the police and advised them to look there 3
for the missing Wolejko child, but they did not believe anything would be done. 3
Joe insisted that the poor young gentleman wear his nickel-chained crucifix, and 3
Gilman put it on and dropped it inside his shirt to humour the fellow. 3
3
Late at night the two youths sat drowsing in their chairs, lulled by the praying of 3
the loom-fixer on the floor below. Gilman listened as he nodded, his 3
preternaturally sharpened hearing seeming to strain for some subtle, dreaded 3
murmur beyond the noises in the ancient house. Unwholesome recollections of 3
things in the Necronomicon and the Black Book welled up, and he found himself 3
swaying to infandous rhythms said to pertain to the blackest ceremonies of the 3
Sabbat and to have an origin outside the time and space we comprehend. 3
3
Presently he realized what he was listening for - the hellish chant of the 3
celebrants in the distant black valley. How did he know so much about what 3
they expected? How did he know the time when Nahab and her acolyte were 3
due to bear the brimming bowl which would follow the black cock and the black 3
goat? He saw that Elwood had dropped asleep, and tried to call out and waken 3
him. Something, however, closed his throat. He was not his own master. Had he 3
signed the black man's book after all? 3
3
Then his fevered, abnormal hearing caught the distant, windborne notes. Over 3
miles of hill and field and alley they came, but he recognized them none the less. 3
The fires must be lit, and the dancers must be starting in. How could he keep 3
himself from going? What was it that had enmeshed him? Mathematics - folklore 3
3
- the house - old Keziah - Brown Jenkin . . . and now he saw that there was a fresh 3
rat-hole in the wall near his couch. Above the distant chanting and the nearer 3
praying of Joe Mazurewicz came another sound - a stealthy, determined 3
scratching in the partitions. He hoped the electric lights would not go out. Then 3
3
3
3
141 3
3
3
3
he saw the fanged, bearded Httle face in the rat-hole - the accursed httle face 3
which he at last realized bore such a shocking, mocking resemblance to old 3
Keziah's - and heard the faint fumbling at the door. 3
3
The screaming twilight abysses flashed before him, and he felt himself helpless 3
in the formless grasp of the iridescent bubble-congeries. Ahead raced the small, 3
kaleidoscopic polyhedron and all through the churning void there was a 3
heightening and acceleration of the vague tonal pattern which seemed to 3
foreshadow some unutterable and unendurable climax. He seemed to know 3
what was coming - the monstrous burst of Walpurgis-rhythm in whose cosmic 3
timbre would be concentrated all the primal, ultimate space-time seethings 3
which lie behind the massed spheres of matter and sometimes break forth in 3
measured reverberations that penetrate faintly to every layer of entity and give 3
hideous significance throughout the worlds to certain dreaded periods. 3
3
But all this vanished in a second. He was again in the cramped, violet-litten 3
peaked space with the slanting floor, the low cases of ancient books, the bench 3
and table, the queer objects, and the triangular gulf at one side. On the table lay a 3
small white figure - an infant boy, unclothed and unconscious - while on the 3
other side stood the monstrous, leering old woman with a gleaming, grotesque- 3
hafted knife in her right hand, and a queerly proportioned pale metal bowl 3
covered with curiously chased designs and having delicate lateral handles in her 3
left. She was intoning some croaking ritual in a language which Gilman could 3
not understand, but which seemed like something guardedly quoted in the 3
Necronomicon. 3
3
As the scene grew clearer he saw the ancient crone bend forward and extend the 3
empty bowl across the table - and unable to control his own emotions, he 3
reached far forward and took it in both hands, noticing as he did so its 3
comparative lightness. At the same moment the disgusting form of Brown Jenkin 3
scrambled up over the brink of the triangular black gulf on his left. The crone 3
now motioned him to hold the bowl in a certain position while she raised the 3
huge, grotesque knife above the small white victim as high as her right hand 3
could reach. The fanged, furry thing began tittering a continuation of the 3
unknown ritual, while the witch croaked loathsome responses. Gilman felt a 3
gnawing poignant abhorrence shoot through his mental and emotional paralysis, 3
and the light metal bowl shook in his grasp. A second later the downward 3
motion of the knife broke the spell conpletely, and he dropped the bowl with a 3
resounding bell-like clangour while his hands darted out frantically to stop the 3
monstrous deed. 3
3
In an instant he had edged up the slanting floor around the end of the table and 3
wrenched the knife from the old woman's claws; sending it clattering over the 3
3
3
3
142 3
3
3
3
brink of the narrow triangular gulf. In another instant, however, matters were 3
reversed; for those murderous claws had locked themselves tightly around his 3
own throat, while the wrinkled face was twisted with insane fury. He felt the 3
chain of the cheap crucifix grinding into his neck, and in his peril wondered how 3
the sight of the object itself would affect the evil creature. Her strength was 3
altogether superhuman, but as she continued her choking he reached feebly in 3
his shirt and drew out the metal symbol, snapping the chain and pulling it free. 3
3
At sight of the device the witch seemed struck with panic, and her grip relaxed 3
long enough to give Gilman a chance to break it entirely. He pulled the steel-like 3
claws from his neck, and would have dragged the beldame over the edge of the 3
gulf had not the claws received a fresh access of strength and closed in again. 3
This time he resolved to reply in kind, and his own hands reached out for the 3
creature's throat. Before she saw what he was doing he had the chain of the 3
crucifix twisted about her neck, and a moment later he had tightened it enough 3
to cut off her breath. During her last struggle he felt something bite at his ankle, 3
and saw that Brown Jenkin had come to her aid. With one savage kick he sent the 3
morbidity over the edge of the gulf and heard it whimper on some level far 3
below. 3
3
Whether he had killed the ancient crone he did not know, but he let her rest on 3
the floor where she had fallen. Then, as he turned away, he saw on the table a 3
sight which nearly snapped the last thread of his reason. Brown Jenkin, tough of 3
sinew and with four tiny hands of demoniac dexterity, had been busy while the 3
witch was throttling him, and his efforts had been in vain. What he had 3
prevented the knife from doing to the victim's chest, the yellow fangs of the furry 3
blasphemy had done to a wrist - and the bowl so lately on the floor stood full 3
beside the small lifeless body. 3
3
In his dream-delirium Gilman heard the hellish alien-rhythmed chant of the 3
Sabbat coming from an infinite distance, and knew the black man must be there. 3
Confused memories mixed themselves with his mathematics, and he believed his 3
subconscious mind held the angles which he needed to guide him back to the 3
normal world alone and unaided for the first time. He felt sure he was in the 3
immemorially sealed loft above his own room, but whether he could ever escape 3
through the slanting floor or the long-stooped egress he doubted greatly. 3
Besides, would not an escape from a dream-loft bring him merely into a dream- 3
house - an abnormal projection of the actual place he sought? He was wholly 3
bewildered as to the relation betwixt dream and reality in all his experiences. 3
3
The passage through the vague abysses would be frightful, for the Walpurgis- 3
rhythm would be vibrating, and at last he would have to hear that hitherto- 3
veiled cosmic pulsing which he so mortally dreaded. Even now he could detect a 3
3
3
3
143 3
3
3
3
low, monstrous shaking whose tempo he suspected all too well. At Sabbat-time it 3
always mounted and reached through to the worlds to summon the initiate to 3
nameless rites. Half the chants of the Sabbat were patterned on this faintly 3
overheard pulsing which no earthly ear could endure in its unveiled spatial 3
fulness. Gilman wondered, too, whether he could trust his instincts to take him 3
back to the right part of space. How could he be sure he would not land on that 3
green-litten hillside of a far planet, on the tessellated terrace above the city of 3
tentacled monsters somewhere beyond the galaxy or in the spiral black vortices 3
of that ultimate void of Chaos where reigns the mindless demon-sultan 3
Azathoth? 3
3
Just before he made the plunge the violet light went out and left him in utter 3
blackness. The witch - old Keziah - Nahab - that must have meant her death. And 3
mixed with the distant chant of the Sabbat and the whimpers of Brown Jenkin in 3
the gulf below he thought he heard another and wilder whine from unknown 3
depths. Joe Mazurewicz - the prayers against the Crawling Chaos now turning to 3
an inexplicably triumphant shriek - worlds of sardonic actuality impinging on 3
vortices of febrile dream - la! Shub-Niggurath! The Goat with a Thousand 3
Young... 3
3
They found Gilman on the floor of his queerly-angled old garret room long 3
before dawn, for the terrible cry had brought Desrochers and Choynski and 3
Dombrowski and Mazurewicz at once, and had even wakened the soundly 3
sleeping Elwood in his chair. He was alive, and with open, staring eyes, but 3
seemed largely unconscious. On his throat were the marks of murderous hands, 3
and on his left ankle was a distressing rat-bite. His clothing was badly rumpled 3
and Joe's crucifix was missing, Elwood trembled, afraid even to speculate what 3
new form his friend's sleep-walking had taken. Mazurewicz seemed half dazed 3
because of a "sign" he said he had had in response to his prayers, and he crossed 3
himself frantically when the squealing and whimpering of a rat sounded from 3
beyond the slanting partition. 3
3
When the dreamer was settled on his couch in Elwood's room they sent for 3
Doctor Malkowski - a local practitioner who would repeat no tales where they 3
might prove embarrassing - and he gave Gilman two hypodermic injections 3
which caused him to relax in something like natural drowsiness. During the day 3
the patient regained consciousness at times and whispered his newest dream 3
disjointedly to Elwood. It was a painful process, and at its very start brought out 3
a fresh and disconcerting fact. 3
3
Gilman - whose ears had so lately possessed an abnormal sensitiveness - was 3
now stone-deaf. Doctor Malkowski, summoned again in haste, told Elwood that 3
both ear-drums were ruptured, as if by the impact of some stupendous sound 3
3
3
3
144 3
3
3
3
intense beyond all human conception or endurance. How such a sound could 3
have been heard in the last few hours without arousing all the Miskatonic Valley 3
was more than the honest physician could say. 3
3
Elwood wrote his part of the colloquy on paper, so that a fairly easy 3
communication was maintained. Neither knew what to make of the whole 3
chaotic business, and decided it would be better if they thought as little as 3
possible about it. Both, though, agreed that they must leave this ancient and 3
accursed house as soon as it could be arranged. Evening papers spoke of a police 3
raid on some curious revellers in a ravine beyond Meadow Hill just before dawn, 3
and mentioned that the white stone there was an object of age- long superstitious 3
regard. Nobody had been caught, but among the scattering fugitives had been 3
glimpsed a huge negro. In another column it was stated that no trace of the 3
missing child Ladislas Wolejko had been found. 3
3
The crowning horror came that very night. Elwood will never forget it, and was 3
forced to stay out of college the rest of the term because of the resulting nervous 3
breakdown. He had thought he heard rats in the partition all the evening, but 3
paid little attention to them. Then, long after both he and Gilman had retired, the 3
atrocious shrieking began. Elwood jumped up, turned on the lights and rushed 3
over to his guest's couch. The occupant was emitting sounds of veritably 3
inhuman nature, as if racked by some torment beyond description. He was 3
writhing under the bedclothes, and a great stain was beginning to appear on the 3
blankets. 3
3
Elwood scarcely dared to touch him, but gradually the screaming and writhing 3
subsided. By this time Dombrowski, Choynski, Desrochers, Mazurewicz, and the 3
top-floor lodger were all crowding into the doorway, and the landlord had sent 3
his wife back to telephone for Doctor Malkowaki. Everybody shrieked when a 3
large rat-like form suddenly jumped out from beneath the ensanguined 3
bedclothes and scuttled across the floor to a fresh, open hole close by. When the 3
doctor arrived and began to pull down those frightful covers Walter Gilman was 3
dead. 3
3
It would be barbarous to do more than suggest what had killed Gilman. There 3
had been virtually a tunnel through his body - something had eaten his heart out. 3
Dombrowski, frantic at the failure of his rat- poisoning efforts, cast aside all 3
thought of his lease and within a week had moved with all his older lodgers to a 3
dingy but less ancient house in Walnut Street. The worst thing for a while was 3
keeping Joe Mazurewicz quiet; for the brooding loom-fixer would never stay 3
sober, and was constantly whining and muttering about spectral and terrible 3
things. 3
3
3
3
145 3
3
3
3
It seems that on that last hideous night Joe had stooped to look at the crimson 3
rat-tracks which led from Gilman's couch to the near-by hole. On the carpet they 3
were very indistinct, but a piece of open flooring intervened between the carpet's 3
edge and the baseboard. There Mazurewicz had found something monstrous - or 3
thought he had, for no one else could quite agree with him despite the 3
undeniable queerness of the prints. The tracks on the flooring were certainly 3
vastly unlike the average prints of a rat but even Choynski and Desrochers 3
would not admit that they were like the prints of four tiny human hands. 3
3
The house was never rented again. As soon as Dombrowski left it the pall of its 3
final desolation began to descend, for people shunned it both on account of its 3
old reputation and because of the new foetid odour. Perhaps the ex-landlord's 3
rat-poison had worked after all, for not long after his departure the place became 3
a neighbourhood nuisance. Health officials traced the smell to the closed spaces 3
above and beside the eastern garret room, and agreed that the number of dead 3
rats must be enormous. They decided, however, that it was not worth their while 3
to hew open and disinfect the long-sealed spaces; for the foetor would soon be 3
over, and the locality was not one which encouraged fastidious standards. 3
Indeed, there were always vague local tales of unexplained stenches upstairs in 3
the Witch-House just after May-Eve and Hallowmass. The neighbours 3
acquiesced in the inertia - but the foetor none the less formed an additional count 3
against the place. Toward the last the house was condemned as a habitation by 3
the building inspector. 3
3
Gilman's dreams and their attendant circumstances have never been explained. 3
Elwood, whose thoughts on the entire episode are sometimes almost maddening, 3
came back to college the next autumn and was graduated in the following June. 3
He found the spectral gossip of the town much disminished, and it is indeed a 3
fact that - notwithstanding certain reports of a ghostly tittering in the deserted 3
house which lasted almost as long as that edifice itself - no fresh appearances 3
either of Old Keziah or of Brown Jenkin have been muttered of since Gilman's 3
death. It is rather fortunate that Elwood was not in Arkham in that later year 3
when certain events abruptly renewed the local whispers about elder horrors. Of 3
course he heard about the matter afterward and suffered untold torments of 3
black and bewildered speculation; but even that was not as bad as actual 3
nearness and several possible sights would have been. 3
3
In March, 1931, a gale wrecked the roof and great chimney of the vacant Witch- 3
House, so that a chaos of crumbling bricks, blackened, moss-grown shingles, and 3
rotting planks and timbers crashed down into the loft and broke through the 3
floor beneath. The whole attic storey was choked with debris from above, but no 3
one took the trouble to touch the mess before the inevitable razing of the decrepit 3
structure. That ultimate step came in the following December, and it was when 3
3
3
3
146 3
3
3
3
Gilman's old room was cleared out by reluctant, apprehensive workmen that the 3
gossip began. 3
3
Among the rubbish which had crashed through the ancient slanting ceiling were 3
several things which made the workmen pause and call in the police. Later the 3
police in turn called in the coroner and several professors from the university. 3
There were bones - badly crushed and splintered, but clearly recognizable as 3
human - whose manifestly modern date conflicted puzzlingly with the remote 3
period at which their only possible lurking place, the low, slant-floored loft 3
overhead, had supposedly been sealed from all human access. The coroner's 3
physician decided that some belonged to a small child, while certain others - 3
found mixed with shreds of rotten brownish cloth - belonged to a rather 3
undersized, bent female of advanced years. Careful sifting of debris also 3
disclosed many tiny bones of rats caught in the collapse, as well as older rat- 3
bones gnawed by small fangs in a fashion now and then highly productive of 3
controversy and reflection. 3
3
Other objects found included the mangled fragments of many books and papers, 3
together with a yellowish dust left from the total disintegration of still older 3
books and papers. All, without exception, appeared to deal with black magic in 3
its most advanced and horrible forms; and the evidently recent date of certain 3
items is still a mystery as unsolved as that of the modern human bones. An even 3
greater mystery is the absolute homogeneity of the crabbed, archaic writing 3
found on a wide range of papers whose conditions and watermarks suggest age 3
differences of at least one hundred and fifty to two hundred years. To some, 3
though, the greatest mystery of all is the variety of utterly inexplicable objects - 3
objects whose shapes, materials, types of workmanship, and purposes baffle all 3
conjecture - found scattered amidst the wreckage in evidently diverse states of 3
injury. One of these things - which excited several Miskatonie professors 3
profoundly is a badly damaged monstrosity plainly resembling the strange 3
image which Oilman gave to the college museum, save that it is large, wrought 3
of some peculiar bluish stone instead of metal, and possessed of a singularly 3
angled pedestal with undecipherable hieroglyphics. 3
3
Archaeologists and anthropologists are still trying to explain the bizarre designs 3
chased on a crushed bowl of light metal whose inner side bore ominous 3
brownish stains when found. Foreigners and credulous grandmothers are 3
equally garrulous about the modern nickel crucifix with broken chain mixed in 3
the rubbish and shiveringly identified by Joe Maturewicz as that which he had 3
given poor Oilman many years before. Some believe this crucifix was dragged up 3
to the sealed loft by rats, while others think it must have been on the floor in 3
some corner of Oilman's old room at the time. Still others, including Joe himself, 3
have theories too wild and fantastic for sober credence. 3

When the slanting wall of Gilman's room was torn out, the once-sealed 3
triangular space between that partition and the house's north wall was found to 3
contain much less structural debris, even in proportion to its size, than the room 3
itself, though it had a ghastly layer of older materials which paralyzed the 3
wreckers with horror. In brief, the floor was a veritable ossuary of the bones of 3
small children - some fairly modern, but others extending back in infinite 3
gradations to a period so remote that crumbling was almost complete. On this 3
deep bony layer rested a knife of great size, obvious antiquity, and grotesque, 3
ornate, and exotic design - above which the debris was piled. 3
3
In the midst of this debris, wedged between a fallen plank and a cluster of 3
cemented bricks from the ruined chimney, was an object destined to cause more 3
bafflement, veiled fright, and openly superstitious talk in Arkham than anything 3
else discovered in the haunted and accursed building. 3
3
This object was the partly crushed skeleton of a huge diseased rat, whose 3
abnormalities of form are still a topic of debate and source of singular reticence 3
among the members of Miskatonic's department of comparative anatomy. Very 3
little concerning this skeleton has leaked out, but the workmen who found it 3
whisper in shocked tones about the long, brownish hairs with which it was 3
associated. 3
3
The bones of the tiny paws, it is rumoured, imply prehensile characteristics more 3
typical of a diminutive monkey than of a rat, while the small skull with its 3
savage yellow fangs is of the utmost anomalousness, appearing from certain 3
angles like a miniature, monstrously degraded parody of a human skull. The 3
workmen crossed themselves in fright when they came upon this blasphemy, but 3
later burned candles of gratitude in St. Stanislaus' Church because of the shrill, 3
ghostly tittering they felt they would never hear again. 3

3
When the last days were upon me, and the ugly trifles of existence began to drive 3
me to madness like the small drops of water that torturers let fall ceaselessly 3
upon one spot of their victims body, I loved the irradiate refuge of sleep. In my 3
dreams I found a little of the beauty I had vainly sought in life, and wandered 3
through old gardens and enchanted woods. 3
3
Once when the wind was soft and scented I heard the south calling, and sailed 3
endlessly and languorously under strange stars. 3
3
Once when the gentle rain fell I glided in a barge down a sunless stream under 3
the earth till I reached another world of purple twilight, iridescent arbours, and 3
undying roses. 3
3
And once I walked through a golden valley that led to shadowy groves and 3
ruins, and ended in a mighty wall green with antique vines, and pierced by a 3
little gate of bronze. 3
3
Many times I walked through that valley, and longer and longer would I pause 3
in the spectral half-light where the giant trees squirmed and twisted grotesquely, 3
and the grey ground stretched damply from trunk to trunk, some times 3
disclosing the mould-stained stones of buried temples. And alway the goal of my 3
fancies was the mighty vine-grown wall with the little gate of bronze therein. 3
3
After a while, as the days of waking became less and less bearable from their 3
greyness and sameness, I would often drift in opiate peace through the valley 3
and the shadowy groves, and wonder how I might seize them for my eternal 3
dwelling-place, so that I need no more crawl back to a dull world stript of 3
interest and new colours. And as I looked upon the little gate in the mighty wall, 3
I felt that beyond it lay a dream-country from which, once it was entered, there 3
would be no return. 3
3
So each night in sleep I strove to find the hidden latch of the gate in the ivied 3
antique wall, though it was exceedingly well hidden. And I would tell myself 3
that the realm beyond the wall was not more lasting merely, but more lovely and 3
radiant as well. 3

3
Then one night in the dream-city of Zakarion I found a yellowed papyrus filled 3
with the thoughts of dream-sages who dwelt of old in that city, and who were 3
too wise ever to be born in the waking world. Therein were written many things 3
concerning the world of dream, and among them was lore of a golden valley and 3
a sacred grove with temples, and a high wall pierced by a little bronze gate. 3
When I saw this lore, I knew that it touched on the scenes I had haunted, and I 3
therefore read long in the yellowed papyrus. 3
3
Some of the dream-sages wrote gorgeously of the wonders beyond the 3
irrepassable gate, but others told of horror and disappointment. I knew not 3
which to believe, yet longed more and more to cross for ever into the unknown 3
land; for doubt and secrecy are the lure of lures, and no new horror can be more 3
terrible than the daily torture of the commonplace. So when I learned of the drug 3
which would unlock the gate and drive me through, I resolved to take it when 3
next I awaked. 3
3
Last night I swallowed the drug and floated dreamily into the golden valley and 3
the shadowy groves; and when I came this time to the antique wall, I saw that 3
the small gate of bronze was ajar. From beyond came a glow that weirdly lit the 3
giant twisted trees and the tops of the buried temples, and I drifted on songfully, 3
expectant of the glories of the land from whence I should never return. 3
3
But as the gate swung wider and the sorcery of the drug and the dream pushed 3
me through, I knew that all sights and glories were at an end; for in that new 3
realm was neither land nor sea, but only the white void of unpeopled and 3
illimitable space. So, happier than I had ever dared hope to be, I dissolved again 3
into that native infinity of crystal oblivion from which the daemon Life had 3
called me for one brief and desolate hour. 3

Life is a hideous thing, and from the background behind what we know of it 3
peer daemoniacal hints of truth which make it sometimes a thousandfold more 3
hideous. Science, already oppressive with its shocking revelations, will perhaps 3
be the ultimate exterminator of our human species-if separate species we be-for 3
its reserve of unguessed horrors could never be borne by mortal brains if loosed 3
upon the world. If we knew what we are, we should do as Sir Arthur Jermyn did; 3
and Arthur Jermyn soaked himself in oil and set fire to his clothing one night. No 3
one placed the charred fragments in an urn or set a memorial to him who had 3
been; for certain papers and a certain boxed object were found which made men 3
wish to forget. Some who knew him do not admit that he ever existed. 3
3
Arthur Jermyn went out on the moor and burned himself after seeing the boxed 3
object which had come from Africa. It was this object, and not his peculiar 3
personal appearance, which made him end his life. Many would have disliked to 3
live if possessed of the peculiar features of Arthur Jermyn, but he had been a 3
poet and scholar and had not minded. Learning was in his blood, for his great- 3
grandfather. Sir Robert Jermyn, Bt., had been an anthropologist of note, whilst 3
his great-great-great-grandfather. Sir Wade Jermyn, was one of the earliest 3
explorers of the Congo region, and had written eruditely of its tribes, animals, 3
and supposed antiquities. Indeed, old Sir Wade had possessed an intellectual 3
zeal amounting almost to a mania; his bizarre conjectures on a prehistoric white 3
Congolese civilisation earning him much ridicule when his book. Observation on 3
the Several Parts of Africa, was published. In 1765 this fearless explorer had been 3
placed in a madhouse at Huntingdon. 3
3
Madness was in all the Jermyns, and people were glad there were not many of 3
them. The line put forth no branches, and Arthur was the last of it. If he had not 3
been, one can not say what he would have done when the object came. The 3
Jermyns never seemed to look quite right-something was amiss, though Arthur 3
was the worst, and the old family portraits in Jermyn House showed fine faces 3
enough before Sir Wade's time. Certainly, the madness began with Sir Wade, 3
whose wild stories of Africa were at once the delight and terror of his few 3
3
3
3

3
3
3
friends. It showed in his collection of trophies and specimens, which were not 3
such as a normal man would accumulate and preserve, and appeared strikingly 3
in the Oriental seclusion in which he kept his wife. The latter, he had said, was 3
the daughter of a Portuguese trader whom he had met in Africa; and did not like 3
English ways. She, with an infant son born in Africa, had accompanied him back 3
from the second and longest of his trips, and had gone with him on the third and 3
last, never returning. No one had ever seen her closely, not even the servants; for 3
her disposition had been violent and singular. During her brief stay at Jermyn 3
House she occupied a remote wing, and was waited on by her husband alone. Sir 3
Wade was, indeed, most peculiar in his solicitude for his family; for when he 3
returned to Africa he would permit no one to care for his young son save a 3
loathsome black woman from Guinea. Upon coming back, after the death of 3
Lady Jermyn, he himself assumed complete care of the boy. 3
3
But it was the talk of Sir Wade, especially when in his cups, which chiefly led his 3
friends to deem him mad. In a rational age like the eighteenth century it was 3
unwise for a man of learning to talk about wild sights and strange scenes under a 3
Congo moon; of the gigantic walls and pillars of a forgotten city, crumbling and 3
vine-grown, and of damp, silent, stone steps leading interminably down into the 3
darkness of abysmal treasure-vaults and inconceivable catacombs. Especially 3
was it unwise to rave of the living things that might haunt such a place; of 3
creatures half of the jungle and half of the impiously aged city-fabulous 3
creatures which even a Pliny might describe with scepticism; things that might 3
have sprung up after the great apes had overrun the dying city with the walls 3
and the pillars, the vaults and the weird carvings. Yet after he came home for the 3
last time Sir Wade would speak of such matters with a shudderingly uncanny 3
zest, mostly after his third glass at the Knight's Head; boasting of what he had 3
found in the jungle and of how he had dwelt among terrible ruins known only to 3
him. And finally he had spoken of the living things in such a manner that he was 3
taken to the madhouse. He had shown little regret when shut into the barred 3
room at Huntingdon, for his mind moved curiously. Ever since his son had 3
commenced to grow out of infancy, he had liked his home less and less, till at last 3
he had seemed to dread it. The Knight's Head had been his headquarters, and 3
when he was confined he expressed some vague gratitude as if for protection. 3
Three years later he died. 3
3
Wade Jermyn's son Philip was a highly peculiar person. Despite a strong 3
physical resemblance to his father, his appearance and conduct were in many 3
particulars so coarse that he was universally shunned. Though he did not inherit 3
the madness which was feared by some, he was densely stupid and given to brief 3
periods of uncontrollable violence. In frame he was small, but intensely 3
powerful, and was of incredible agility. Twelve years after succeeding to his title 3
he married the daughter of his gamekeeper, a person said to be of gypsy 3
3
3
3

3
3
3
extraction, but before his son was born joined the navy as a common sailor, 3
completing the general disgust which his habits and misalliance had begun. 3
After the close of the American war he was heard of as sailor on a merchantman 3
in the African trade, having a kind of reputation for feats of strength and 3
climbing, but finally disappearing one night as his ship lay off the Congo coast. 3
3
In the son of Sir Philip Jermyn the now accepted family peculiarity took a strange 3
and fatal turn. Tall and fairly handsome, with a sort of weird Eastern grace 3
despite certain slight oddities of proportion, Robert Jermyn began life as a 3
scholar and investigator. It was he who first studied scientifically the vast 3
collection of relics which his mad grandfather had brought from Africa, and who 3
made the family name as celebrated in ethnology as in exploration. In 1815 Sir 3
Robert married a daughter of the seventh Viscount Brightholme and was 3
subsequently blessed with three children, the eldest and youngest of whom were 3
never publicly seen on account of deformities in mind and body. Saddened by 3
these family misfortunes, the scientist sought relief in work, and made two long 3
expeditions in the interior of Africa. In 1849 his second son, Nevil, a singularly 3
repellent person who seemed to combine the surliness of Philip Jermyn with the 3
hauteur of the Brightholmes, ran away with a vulgar dancer, but was pardoned 3
upon his return in the following year. He came back to Jermyn House a widower 3
with an infant son, Alfred, who was one day to be the father of Arthur Jermyn. 3
3
Friends said that it was this series of griefs which unhinged the mind of Sir 3
Robert Jermyn, yet it was probably merely a bit of African folklore which caused 3
the disaster. The elderly scholar had been collecting legends of the Onga tribes 3
near the field of his grandfather's and his own explorations, hoping in some way 3
to account for Sir Wade's wild tales of a lost city peopled by strange hybrid 3
creatures. A certain consistency in the strange papers of his ancestor suggested 3
that the madman's imagination might have been stimulated by native myths. On 3
October 19, 1852, the explorer Samuel Seaton called at Jermyn House with a 3
manuscript of notes collected among the Ongas, believing that certain legends of 3
a gray city of white apes ruled by a white god might prove valuable to the 3
ethnologist. In his conversation he probably supplied many additional details; 3
the nature of which will never be known, since a hideous series of tragedies 3
suddenly burst into being. When Sir Robert Jermyn emerged from his library he 3
left behind the strangled corpse of the explorer, and before he could be 3
restrained, had put an end to all three of his children; the two who were never 3
seen, and the son who had run away. Nevil Jermyn died in the successful 3
defence of his own two-year-old son, who had apparently been included in the 3
old man's madly murderous scheme. Sir Robert himself, after repeated attempts 3
at suicide and a stubborn refusal to utter an articulate sound, died of apoplexy in 3
the second year of his confinement. 3

Sir Alfred Jermyn was a baronet before his fourth birthday, but his tastes never 3
matched his title. At twenty he had joined a band of music-hall performers, and 3
at thirty-six had deserted his wife and child to travel with an itinerant American 3
circus. His end was very revolting. Among the animals in the exhibition with 3
which he travelled was a huge bull gorilla of lighter colour than the average; a 3
surprisingly tractable beast of much popularity with the performers. With this 3
gorilla Alfred Jermyn was singularly fascinated, and on many occasions the two 3
would eye each other for long periods through the intervening bars. Eventually 3
Jermyn asked and obtained permission to train the animal, astonishing audiences 3
and fellow performers alike with his success. One morning in Chicago, as the 3
gorilla and Alfred Jermyn were rehearsing an exceedingly clever boxing match, 3
the former delivered a blow of more than the usual force, hurting both the body 3
and the dignity of the amateur trainer. Of what followed, members of "The 3
Greatest Show On Earth" do not like to speak. They did not expect to hear Sir 3
Alfred Jermyn emit a shrill, inhuman scream, or to see him seize his clumsy 3
antagonist with both hands, dash it to the floor of the cage, and bite fiendishly at 3
its hairy throat. The gorilla was off its guard, but not for long, and before 3
anything could be done by the regular trainer, the body which had belonged to a 3
baronet was past recognition. 3

II 3
3
Arthur Jermyn was the son of Sir Alfred Jermyn and a music-hall singer of 3
unknown origin. When the husband and father deserted his family, the mother 3
took the child to Jermyn House; where there was none left to object to her 3
presence. She was not without notions of what a nobleman's dignity should be, 3
and saw to it that her son received the best education which limited money could 3
provide. The family resources were now sadly slender, and Jermyn House had 3
fallen into woeful disrepair, but young Arthur loved the old edifice and all its 3
contents. He was not like any other Jermyn who had ever lived, for he was a poet 3
and a dreamer. Some of the neighbouring families who had heard tales of old Sir 3
Wade Jermyn's unseen Portuguese wife declared that her Latin blood must be 3
showing itself; but most persons merely sneered at his sensitiveness to beauty, 3
attributing it to his music-hall mother, who was socially unrecognised. The 3
poetic delicacy of Arthur Jermyn was the more remarkable because of his 3
uncouth personal appearance. Most of the Jermyns had possessed a subtly odd 3
and repellent cast, but Arthur's case was very striking. It is hard to say just what 3
he resembled, but his expression, his facial angle, and the length of his arms gave 3
a thrill of repulsion to those who met him for the first time. 3
3
It was the mind and character of Arthur Jermyn which atoned for his aspect. 3
Gifted and learned, he took highest honours at Oxford and seemed likely to 3
redeem the intellectual fame of his family. Though of poetic rather than scientific 3
3
3
3
154 3
3
3
3
temperament, he planned to continue the work of his forefathers in African 3
ethnology and antiquities, utilising the truly wonderful though strange collection 3
of Sir Wade. With his fanciful mind he thought often of the prehistoric 3
civilisation in which the mad explorer had so implicitly believed, and would 3
weave tale after tale about the silent jungle city mentioned in the latter's wilder 3
notes and paragraphs. For the nebulous utterances concerning a nameless, 3
unsuspected race of jungle hybrids he had a peculiar feeling of mingled terror 3
and attraction, speculating on the possible basis of such a fancy, and seeking to 3
obtain light among the more recent data gleaned by his great-grandfather and 3
Samuel Seaton amongst the Ongas. 3
3
In 1911, after the death of his mother. Sir Arthur Jermyn determined to pursue 3
his investigations to the utmost extent. Selling a portion of his estate to obtain the 3
requisite money, he outfitted an expedition and sailed for the Congo. Arranging 3
with the Belgian authorities for a party of guides, he spent a year in the Onga 3
and Kahn country, finding data beyond the highest of his expectations. Among 3
the Kaliris was an aged chief called Mwanu, who possessed not only a highly 3
retentive memory, but a singular degree of intelligence and interest in old 3
legends. This ancient confirmed every tale which Jermyn had heard, adding his 3
own account of the stone city and the white apes as it had been told to him. 3
3
According to Mwanu, the gray city and the hybrid creatures were no more, 3
having been annihilated by the warlike N'bangus many years ago. This tribe, 3
after destroying most of the edifices and killing the live beings, had carried off 3
the stuffed goddess which had been the object of their quest; the white ape- 3
goddess which the strange beings worshipped, and which was held by Congo 3
tradition to be the form of one who had reigned as a princess among these 3
beings. Just what the white apelike creatures could have been, Mwanu had no 3
idea, but he thought they were the builders of the ruined city. Jermyn could form 3
no conjecture, but by close questioning obtained a very picturesque legend of the 3
stuffed goddess. 3
3
The ape-princess, it was said, became the consort of a great white god who had 3
come out of the West. For a long time they had reigned over the city together, but 3
when they had a son, all three went away. Later the god and princess had 3
returned, and upon the death of the princess her divine husband had 3
mummified the body and enshrined it in a vast house of stone, where it was 3
worshipped. Then he departed alone. The legend here seemed to present three 3
variants. According to one story, nothing further happened save that the stuffed 3
goddess became a symbol of supremacy for whatever tribe might possess it. It 3
was for this reason that the N'bangus carried it off. A second story told of a god's 3
return and death at the feet of his enshrined wife. A third told of the return of the 3
son, grown to manhood-or apehood or godhood, as the case might be-yet 3
3
3
3
155 3
3
3
3
unconscious of his identity. Surely the imaginative blacks had made the most of 3
whatever events might lie behind the extravagant legendry. 3
3
Of the reality of the jungle city described by old Sir Wade, Arthur Jermyn had no 3
further doubt; and was hardly astonished when early in 1912 he came upon what 3
was left of it. Its size must have been exaggerated, yet the stones lying about 3
proved that it was no mere Negro village. Unfortunately no carvings could be 3
found, and the small size of the expedition prevented operations toward clearing 3
the one visible passageway that seemed to lead down into the system of vaults 3
which Sir Wade had mentioned. The white apes and the stuffed goddess were 3
discussed with all the native chiefs of the region, but it remained for a European 3
to improve on the data offered by old Mwanu. M. Verhaeren, Belgian agent at a 3
trading-post on the Congo, believed that he could not only locate but obtain the 3
stuffed goddess, of which he had vaguely heard; since the once mighty N'bangus 3
were now the submissive servants of King Albert's government, and with but 3
little persuasion could be induced to part with the gruesome deity they had 3
carried off. When Jermyn sailed for England, therefore, it was with the exultant 3
probability that he would within a few months receive a priceless ethnological 3
relic confirming the wildest of his great-great-great-grandfather's narratives-that 3
is, the wildest which he had ever heard. Countrymen near Jermyn House had 3
perhaps heard wilder tales handed down from ancestors who had listened to Sir 3
Wade around the tables of the Knight's Head. 3
3
Arthur Jermyn waited very patiently for the expected box from M. Verhaeren, 3
meanwhile studying with increased diligence the manuscripts left by his mad 3
ancestor. He began to feel closely akin to Sir Wade, and to seek relics of the 3
latter's personal life in England as well as of his African exploits. Oral accounts 3
of the mysterious and secluded wife had been numerous, but no tangible relic of 3
her stay at Jermyn House remained. Jermyn wondered what circumstance had 3
prompted or permitted such an effacement, and decided that the husband's 3
insanity was the prime cause. His great-great-great-grandmother, he recalled, 3
was said to have been the daughter of a Portuguese trader in Africa. No doubt 3
her practical heritage and superficial knowledge of the Dark Continent had 3
caused her to flout Sir Wade's tales of the interior, a thing which such a man 3
would not be likely to forgive. She had died in Africa, perhaps dragged thither 3
by a husband determined to prove what he had told. But as Jermyn indulged in 3
these reflections he could not but smile at their futility, a century and a half after 3
the death of both his strange progenitors. 3
3
In June, 1913, a letter arrived from M. Verhaeren, telling of the finding of the 3
stuffed goddess. It was, the Belgian averred, a most extraordinary object; an 3
object quite beyond the power of a layman to classify. Whether it was human or 3
simian only a scientist could determine, and the process of determination would 3
3
3
3
156 3
3
3
3
be greatly hampered by its imperfect condition. Time and the Congo chmate are 3
not kind to mummies; especially when their preparation is as amateurish as 3
seemed to be the case here. Around the creature's neck had been found a golden 3
chain bearing an empty locket on which were armorial designs; no doubt some 3
hapless traveller's keepsake, taken by the N'bangus and hung upon the goddess 3
as a charm. In commenting on the contour of the mummy's face, M. Verhaeren 3
suggested a whimsical comparison; or rather, expressed a humorous wonder just 3
how it would strike his corespondent, but was too much interested scientifically 3
to waste many words in levity. The stuffed goddess, he wrote, would arrive duly 3
packed about a month after receipt of the letter. 3
3
The boxed object was delivered at Jermyn House on the afternoon of August 3, 3
1913, being conveyed immediately to the large chamber which housed the 3
collection of African specimens as arranged by Sir Robert and Arthur. What 3
ensued can best be gathered from the tales of servants and from things and 3
papers later examined. Of the various tales, that of aged Soames, the family 3
butler, is most ample and coherent. According to this trustworthy man. Sir 3
Arthur Jermyn dismissed everyone from the room before opening the box, 3
though the instant sound of hammer and chisel showed that he did not delay the 3
operation. Nothing was heard for some time; just how long Soames cannot 3
exactly estimate, but it was certainly less than a quarter of an hour later that the 3
horrible scream, undoubtedly in Jermyn's voice, was heard. Immediately 3
afterward Jermyn emerged from the room, rushing frantically toward the front of 3
the house as if pursued by some hideous enemy. The expression on his face, a 3
face ghastly enough in repose, was beyond description. When near the front door 3
he seemed to think of something, and turned back in his flight, finally 3
disappearing down the stairs to the cellar. The servants were utterly 3
dumbfounded, and watched at the head of the stairs, but their master did not 3
return. A smell of oil was all that came up from the regions below. After dark a 3
rattling was heard at the door leading from the cellar into the courtyard; and a 3
stable-boy saw Arthur Jermyn, glistening from head to foot with oil and redolent 3
of that fluid, steal furtively out and vanish on the black moor surrounding the 3
house. Then, in an exaltation of supreme horror, everyone saw the end. A spark 3
appeared on the moor, a flame arose, and a pillar of human fire reached to the 3
heavens. The house of Jermyn no longer existed. 3
3
The reason why Arthur Jermyn's charred fragments were not collected and 3
buried lies in what was found afterward, principally the thing in the box. The 3
stuffed goddess was a nauseous sight, withered and eaten away, but it was 3
clearly a mummified white ape of some unknown species, less hairy than any 3
recorded variety, and infinitely nearer mankind-quite shockingly so. Detailed 3
description would be rather unpleasant, but two salient particulars must be told, 3
for they fit in revoltingly with certain notes of Sir Wade Jermyn's African 3
3
3
3
157 3
3
3
3
expeditions and with the Congolese legends of the white god and the ape- 3
princess. The two particulars in question are these: the arms on the golden locket 3
about the creature's neck were the Jermyn arms, and the jocose suggestion of M. 3
Verhaeren about certain resemblance as connected with the shrivelled face 3
applied with vivid, ghastly, and unnatural horror to none other than the 3
sensitive Arthur Jermyn, great-great-great-grandson of Sir Wade Jermyn and an 3
unknown wife. Members of the Royal Anthropological Institute burned the thing 3
and threw the locket into a well, and some of them do not admit that Arthur 3
Jermyn ever existed. 3

Horrible beyond conception was the change which had taken place in my best 3
friend, Crawford Tillinghast. I had not seen him since that day, two months and 3
a half before, when he told me toward what goal his physical and metaphysical 3
researches were leading; when he had answered my awed and almost frightened 3
remonstrances by driving me from his laboratory and his house in a burst of 3
fanatical rage. I had known that he now remained mostly shut in the attic 3
laboratory with that accursed electrical machine, eating little and excluding even 3
the servants, but I had not thought that a brief period of ten weeks could so alter 3
and disfigure any human creature. It is not pleasant to see a stout man suddenly 3
grown thin, and it is even worse when the baggy skin becomes yellowed or 3
grayed, the eyes sunken, circled, and uncannily glowing, the forehead veined 3
and corrugated, and the hands tremulous and twitching. And if added to this 3
there be a repellent unkemptness, a wild disorder of dress, a bushiness of dark 3
hair white at the roots, and an unchecked growth of white beard on a face once 3
clean-shaven, the cumulative effect is quite shocking. But such was the aspect of 3
Crawford TilUinghast on the night his half coherent message brought me to his 3
door after my weeks of exile; such was the specter that trembled as it admitted 3
me, candle in hand, and glanced furtively over its shoulder as if fearful of unseen 3
things in the ancient, lonely house set back from Benevolent Street. 3
3
That Crawford Tilinghast should ever have studied science and philosophy was 3
a mistake. These things should be left to the frigid and impersonal investigator 3
for they offer two equally tragic alternatives to the man of feeling and action; 3
despair, if he fail in his quest, and terrors unutterable and unimaginable if he 3
succeed. Tillinghast had once been the prey of failure, solitary and melancholy; 3
but now I knew, with nauseating fears of my own, that he was the prey of 3
success. I had indeed warned him ten weeks before, when he burst forth with his 3
tale of what he felt himself about to discover. He had been flushed and excited 3
then, talking in a high and unnatural, though always pedantic, voice. 3
3
"What do we know," he had said, "of the world and the universe about us? Our 3
means of receiving impressions are absurdly few, and our notions of 3
surrounding objects infinitely narrow. We see things only as we are constructed 3
to see them, and can gain no idea of their absolute nature. With five feeble senses 3
we pretend to comprehend the boundlessly complex cosmos, yet other beings 3
with wider, stronger, or different range of senses might not only see very 3
3
3
3
159 3
3
3
3
differently the things we see, but might see and study whole worlds of matter, 3
energy, and life which lie close at hand yet can never be detected with the senses 3
we have. I have always believed that such strange, inaccessible worlds exist at 3
our very elbows, and now I believe I have found a way to break dawn the 3
barriers. I am not joking. Within twenty-four hours that machine near the table 3
will generate waves acting on unrecognized sense organs that exist in us as 3
atrophied or rudimentary vestiges. Those waves will open up to us many vistas 3
unknown to man and several unknown to anything we consider organic life. We 3
shall see that at which dogs howl in the dark, and that at which cats prick up 3
their ears after midnight. We shall see these things, and other things which no 3
breathing creature has yet seen. We shall overleap time, space, and dimensions, 3
and without bodily motion peer to the bottom of creation." 3
3
When Tillinghast said these things I remonstrated, for I knew him well enough to 3
be frightened rather than amused; but he was a fanatic, and drove me from the 3
house. Now he was no less a fanatic, but his desire to speak had conquered his 3
resentment, and he had written me imperatively in a hand I could scarcely 3
recognize. As I entered the abode of the friend so suddenly metamorphosed to a 3
shivering gargoyle, I became infected with the terror which seemed stalking in 3
all the shadows. The words and beliefs expressed ten weeks before seemed 3
bodied forth in the darkness beyond the small circle of candle light, and I 3
sickened at the hollow, altered voice of my host. I wished the servants were 3
about, and did not like it when he said they had all left three days previously. It 3
seemed strange that old Gregory, at least, should desert his master without 3
telling as tried a friend as I. It was he who had given me all the information I had 3
of Tillinghast after I was repulsed in rage. 3
3
Yet I soon subordinated all my fears to my growing curiosity and fascination. 3
Just what Crawford Tillinghast now wished of me I could only guess, but that he 3
had some stupendous secret or discovery to impart, I could not doubt. Before I 3
had protested at his unnatural pryings into the unthinkable; now that he had 3
evidently succeeded to some degree I almost shared his spirit, terrible though the 3
cost of victory appeared. Up through the dark emptiness of the house I followed 3
the bobbing candle in the hand of this shaking parody on man. The electricity 3
seemed to be turned off, and when I asked my guide he said it was for a definite 3
reason. 3
3
"It would he too much... I would not dare," he continued to mutter. I especially 3
noted his new habit of muttering, for it was not like him to talk to himself. We 3
entered the laboratory in the attic, and I observed that detestable electrical 3
machine, glowing with a sickly, sinister violet luminosity. It was connected with 3
a powerful chemical battery, but seemed to be receiving no current; for I recalled 3
that in its experimental stage it had sputtered and purred when in action. In 3
3
3
3
160 3
3
3
3
reply to my question Tillinghast mumbled that this permanent glow was not 3
electrical in any sense that I could understand. 3
3
He now seated me near the machine, so that it was on my right, and turned a 3
switch somewhere below the crowning cluster of glass bulbs. The usual 3
sputtering began, turned to a whine, and terminated in a drone so soft as to 3
suggest a return to silence. Meanwhile the luminosity increased, waned again, 3
then assumed a pale, outre colour or blend of colours which I could neither place 3
nor describe. Tillinghast had been watching me, and noted my puzzled 3
expression. 3
3
"Do you know what that is?" he whispered, "That is ultra-violet." He chuckled 3
oddly at my surprise. "You thought ultra-violet was invisible, and so it is - but 3
you can see that and many other invisible things now. 3
3
"Listen to me! The waves from that thing are waking a thousand sleeping senses 3
in us; senses which we inherit from aeons of evolution from the state of detached 3
electrons to the state of organic humanity. I have seen the truth, and I intend to 3
show it to you. Do you wonder how it will seem? I will tell you." Here 3
Trninghast seated himself directly opposite me, blowing out his candle and 3
staring hideously into my eyes. "Your existing sense-organs - ears first, I think - 3
will pick up many of the impressions, for they are closely connected with the 3
dormant organs. Then there will be others. You have heard of the pineal gland? I 3
laugh at the shallow endocrinologist, fellow-dupe and fellow-parvenu of the 3
Freudian. That gland is the great sense organ of organs - I have found out. It is 3
like sight in the end, and transmits visual pictures to the brain. If you are normal, 3
that is the way you ought to get most of it. . . I mean get most of the evidence 3
from beyond." 3
3
I looked about the immense attic room with the sloping south wall, dimly lit by 3
rays which the every day eye cannot see. The far corners were all shadows and 3
the whole place took on a hazy unreality which obscured its nature and invited 3
the imagination to symbolism and phantasm. During the interval that Tillinghast 3
was long silent I fancied myself in some vast incredible temple of long-dead 3
gods; some vague edifice of innumerable black stone columns reaching up from 3
a floor of damp slabs to a cloudy height beyond the range of my vision. The 3
picture was very vivid for a while, but gradually gave way to a more horrible 3
conception; that of utter, absolute solitude in infinite, sightless, soundless space. 3
There seemed to a void, and nothing more, and I felt a childish fear which 3
prompted me to draw from my hip pocket the revolver I carried after dark since 3
the night I was held up in East Providence. Then from the farthermost regions of 3
remoteness, the sound softly glided into existence. It was infinitely faint, subtly 3
vibrant, and unmistakably musical, but held a quality of surpassing wildness 3
3
3
3
161 3
3
3
3
which made its impact feel Hke a dehcate torture of my whole body. I felt 3
sensations like those one feels when accidentally scratching ground glass. 3
Simultaneously there developed something like a cold draught, which 3
apparently swept past me from the direction of the distant sound. As I waited 3
breathlessly I perceived that both sound and wind were increasing; the effect 3
being to give me an odd notion of myself as tied to a pair of rails in the path of a 3
gigantic approaching locomotive. I began to speak to Tillinghast, and as I did so 3
all the unusual impressions abruptly vanished. I saw only the man, the glowing 3
machines, and the dim apartment. Tillinghast was grinning repulsively at the 3
revolver which I had almost unconsciously drawn, but from his expression I was 3
sure he had seen and heard as much as I, if not a great deal more. I whispered 3
what I had experienced and he bade me to remain as quiet and receptive as 3
possible. 3
3
"Don't move," he cautioned, "for in these rays we are able to be seen as well as to 3
see. I told you the servants left, but I didn't tell you how. It was that thick-witted 3
house-keeper - she turned on the lights downstairs after I had warned her not to, 3
and the wires picked up sympathetic vibrations. It must have been frightful - I 3
could hear the screams up here in spite of all I was seeing and hearing from 3
another direction, and later it was rather awful to find those empty heaps of 3
clothes around the house. Mrs. Updike's clothes were close to the front hall 3
switch - that's how I know she did it. It got them all. But so long as we don't 3
move we're fairly safe. Remember we're dealing with a hideous world in which 3
we are practically helpless... Keep still!" 3
3
The combined shock of the revelation and of the abrupt command gave me a 3
kind of paralysis, and in my terror my mind again opened to the impressions 3
coming from what Tillinghast called "beyond." I was now in a vortex of sound 3
and motion, with confused pictures before my eyes. I saw the blurred outlines of 3
the room, but from some point in space there seemed to be pouring a seething 3
column of unrecognizable shapes or clouds, penetrating the solid roof at a point 3
ahead and to the right of me. Then I glimpsed the temple - like effect again, but 3
this time the pillars reached up into an aerial ocean of light, which sent down one 3
blinding beam along the path of the cloudy column I had seen before. After that 3
the scene was almost wholly kaleidoscopic, and in the jumble of sights, sounds, 3
and unidentified sense-impressions I felt that I was about to dissolve or in some 3
way lose the solid form. One definite flash I shall always remember. I seemed for 3
an instant to behold a patch of strange night sky filled with shining, revolving 3
spheres, and as it receded I saw that the glowing suns formed a constellation or 3
galaxy of settled shape; this shape being the distorted face of Crawford 3
Tillinghast. At another time I felt the huge animate things brushing past me and 3
occasionally walking or drifting through my supposedly solid body, and thought 3
I saw Tillinghast look at them as though his better trained senses could catch 3
3
3
3
162 3
3
3
3
them visually. I recalled what he had said of the pineal gland, and wondered 3
what he saw with this preternatural eye. 3
3
Suddenly I myself became possessed of a kind of augmented sight. Over and 3
above the luminous and shadowy chaos arose a picture which, though vague, 3
held the elements of consistency and permanence. It was indeed somewhat 3
familiar, for the unusual part was superimposed upon the usual terrestrial scene 3
much as a cinema view may be thrown upon the painted curtain of a theater. I 3
saw the attic laboratory, the electrical machine, and the unsightly form of 3
Tillinghast opposite me; but of all the space unoccupied by familiar objects not 3
one particle was vacant. Indescribable shapes both alive and otherwise were 3
mixed in disgusting disarray, and close to every known thing were whole worlds 3
of alien, unknown entities. It likewise seemed that all the known things entered 3
into the composition of other unknown things and vice versa. Foremost among 3
the living objects were inky, jellyfish monstrosities which flabbily quivered in 3
harmony with the vibrations from the machine. They were present in loathsome 3
profusion, and I saw to my horror that they overlapped; that they were semi- 3
fluid and capable of passing through one another and through what we know as 3
solids. These things were never still, but seemed ever floating about with some 3
malignant purpose. Sometimes they appeared to devour one another, the 3
attacker launching itself at its victim and instantaneously obliterating the latter 3
from sight. Shudderingly I felt that I knew what had obliterated the unfortunate 3
servants, and could not exclude the thing from my mind as I strove to observe 3
other properties of the newly visible world that lies unseen around us. But 3
Tillinghast had been watching me and was speaking. 3
3
"You see them? You see them? You see the things that float and flop about you 3
and through you every moment of your life? You see the creatures that form 3
what men call the pure air and the blue sky? Have I not succeeded in breaking 3
down the barrier; have I not shown you worlds that no other living men have 3
seen?" I heard his scream through the horrible chaos, and looked at the wild face 3
thrust so offensively close to mine. His eyes were pits of flame, and they glared 3
at me with what I now saw was overwhelming hatred. The machine droned 3
detestably. 3
3
"You think those floundering things wiped out the servants? Fool, they are 3
harmless! But the servants are gone, aren't they? You tried to stop me; you 3
discouraged me when I needed every drop of encouragement I could get; you 3
were afraid of the cosmic truth, you damned coward, but now I've got you! What 3
swept up the servants? What made them scream so loud?... Don't know, eh! 3
You'll know soon enough. Look at me - listen to what I say - do you suppose 3
there are really any such things as time and magnitude? Do you fancy there are 3
such things as form or matter? I tell you, I have struck depths that your little 3
3
3
3
163 3
3
3
3
brain can't picture. I have seen beyond the bounds of infinity and drawn down 3
daemons from the stars... I have harnessed the shadows that stride from world 3
to world to sow death and madness... Space belongs to me, do you hear? Things 3
are hunting me now - the things that devour and dissolve - but I know how to 3
elude them. It is you they will get, as they got the servants... Stirring, dear sir? I 3
told you it was dangerous to move, I have saved you so far by telling you to keep 3
still - saved you to see more sights and to listen to me. If you had moved, they 3
would have been at you long ago. Don't worry, they won't hurt you. They didn't 3
hurt the servants - it was the seeing that made the poor devils scream so. My pets 3
are not pretty, for they come out of places where aesthetic standards are - very 3
different. Disintegration is quite painless, I assure you — but I want you to see 3
them. I almost saw them, but I knew how to stop. You are curious? I always 3
knew you were no scientist. Trembling, eh. Trembling with anxiety to see the 3
ultimate things I have discovered. Why don't you move, then? Tired? Well, don't 3
worry, my friend, for they are coming... Look, look, curse you, look... it's just 3
over your left shoulder. . ." 3
3
What remains to be told is very brief, and may be familiar to you from the 3
newspaper accounts. The police heard a shot in the old Tillinghast house and 3
found us there - Tillinghast dead and me unconscious. They arrested me because 3
the revolver was in my hand, but released me in three hours, after they found it 3
was apoplexy which had finished Tillinghast and saw that my shot had been 3
directed at the noxious machine which now lay hopelessly shattered on the 3
laboratory floor. I did not tell very much of what I had seen, for I feared the 3
coroner would be skeptical; but from the evasive outline I did give, the doctor 3
told me that I had undoubtedly been hypnotized by the vindictive and homicidal 3
madman. 3
3
I wish I could believe that doctor. It would help my shaky nerves if I could 3
dismiss what I now have to think of the air and the sky about and above me. I 3
never feel alone or comfortable, and a hideous sense of pursuit sometimes comes 3
chillingly on me when I am weary. What prevents me from believing the doctor 3
is one simple fact - that the police never found the bodies of those servants whom 3
they say Crawford Tillinghast murdered. 3

I saw him on a sleepless night when I was walking desperately to save my soul 3
and my vision. My coming to New York had been a mistake; for whereas I had 3
looked for poignant wonder and inspiration in the teeming labyrinths of ancient 3
streets that twist endlessly from forgotten courts and squares and waterfronts to 3
courts and squares and waterfronts equally forgotten, and in the Cyclopean 3
modern towers and pinnacles that rise blackly Babylonian under waning moons, 3
I had found instead only a sense of horror and oppression which threatened to 3
master, paralyze, and annihilate me. 3
3
The disillusion had been gradual. Coming for the first time upon the town, I had 3
seen it in the sunset from a bridge, majestic above its waters, its incredible peaks 3
and pyramids rising flowerlike and delicate from pools of violet mist to play 3
with the flaming clouds and the first stars of evening. Then it had lighted up 3
window by window above the shimmering tides where lanterns nodded and 3
glided and deep horns bayed weird harmonies, and had itself become a starry 3
firmament of dream, redolent of faery music, and one with the marvels of 3
Carcassonne and Samarcand and El Dorado and all glorious and half- fabulous 3
cities. Shortly afterward I was taken through those antique ways so dear to my 3
fancy-narrow, curving alleys and passages where rows of red Georgian brick 3
blinked with small-paned dormers above pillared doorways that had looked on 3
gilded sedans and paneled coaches - and in the first flush of realization of these 3
long-wished things I thought I had indeed achieved such treasures as would 3
make me in time a poet. 3
3
But success and happiness were not to be. Garish daylight showed only squalor 3
and alienage and the noxious elephantiasis of climbing, spreading stone where 3
the moon had hinted of loveliness and elder magic; and the throngs of people 3
that seethed through the flume-like streets were squat, swarthy strangers with 3
hardened faces and narrow eyes, shrewd strangers without dreams and without 3
kinship to the scenes about them, who could never mean aught to a blue-eyed 3
man of the old folk, with the love of fair green lanes and white New England 3
village steeples in his heart. 3
3
So instead of the poems I had hoped for, there came only a shuddering blackness 3
and ineffable loneliness; and I saw at last a fearful truth which no one had ever 3
dared to breathe before - the unwhisperable secret of secrets - the fact that this 3
3
3
3

3
3
3
city of stone and stridor is not a sentient perpetuation of Old New York as 3
London is of Old London and Paris of Old Paris, but that it is in fact quite dead, 3
its sprawling body imperfectly embalmed and infested with queer animate 3
things which have nothing to do with it as it was in life. Upon making this 3
discovery I ceased to sleep comfortably; though something of resigned 3
tranquillity came back as I gradually formed the habit of keeping off the streets 3
by day and venturing abroad only at night, when darkness calls forth what little 3
of the past still hovers wraith-like about, and old white doorways remember the 3
stalwart forms that once passed through them. With this mode of relief I even 3
wrote a few poems, and still refrained from going home to my people lest I seem 3
to crawl back ignobly in defeat. 3
3
Then, on a sleepless night's walk, I met the man. It was in a grotesque hidden 3
courtyard of the Greenwich section, for there in my ignorance I had settled, 3
having heard of the place as the natural home of poets and artists. The archaic 3
lanes and houses and unexpected bits of square and court had indeed delighted 3
me, and when I found the poets and artists to be loud-voiced pretenders whose 3
quaintness is tinsel and whose lives are a denial of all that pure beauty which is 3
poetry and art, I stayed on for love of these venerable things. I fancied them as 3
they were in their prime, when Greenwich was a placid village not yet engulfed 3
by the town; and in the hours before dawn, when all the revellers had slunk 3
away, I used to wander alone among their cryptical windings and brood upon 3
the curious arcana which generations must have deposited there. This kept my 3
soul alive, and gave me a few of those dreams and visions for which the poet far 3
within me cried out. 3
3
The man came upon me at about two one cloudy August morning, as I was 3
threading a series of detached courtyards; now accessible only through the 3
unlighted hallways of intervening buildings, but once forming parts of a 3
continuous network of picturesque alleys. I had heard of them by vague rumor, 3
and realized that they could not be upon any map of today; but the fact that they 3
were forgotten only endeared them to me, so that I had sought them with twice 3
my usual eagerness. Now that I had found them, my eagerness was again 3
redoubled; for something in their arrangement dimly hinted that they might be 3
only a few of many such, with dark, dumb counterparts wedged obscurely 3
betwixt high blank walls and deserted rear tenements, or lurking lamplessly 3
behind archways unbetrayed by hordes of the foreign-speaking or guarded by 3
furtive and uncommunicative artists whose practises do not invite publicity or 3
the light of day. 3
3
He spoke to me without invitation, noting my mood and glances as I studied 3
certain knockered doorways above iron-railed steps, the pallid glow of traceried 3
transoms feebly lighting my face. His own face was in shadow, and he wore a 3
3
3
3
166 3
3
3
3
wide-brimmed hat which somehow blended perfectly with the out-of-date cloak 3
he affected; but I was subtly disquieted even before he addressed me. His form 3
was very slight; thin almost to cadaverousness; and his voice proved 3
phenomenally soft and hollow, though not particularly deep. He had, he said, 3
noticed me several times at my wanderings; and inferred that I resembled him in 3
loving the vestiges of former years. Would I not like the guidance of one long 3
practised in these explorations, and possessed of local information profoundly 3
deeper than any which an obvious newcomer could possibly have gained? 3
3
As he spoke, I caught a glimpse of his face in the yellow beam from a solitary 3
attic window. It was a noble, even a handsome elderly countenance; and bore the 3
marks of a lineage and refinement unusual for the age and place. Yet some 3
quality about it disturbed me almost as much as its features pleased me - perhaps 3
it was too white, or too expressionless, or too much out of keeping with the 3
locality, to make me feel easy or comfortable. Nevertheless I followed him; for in 3
those dreary days my quest for antique beauty and mystery was all that I had to 3
keep my soul alive, and I reckoned it a rare favor of Fate to fall in with one 3
whose kindred seekings seemed to have penetrated so much farther than mine. 3
3
Something in the night constrained the cloaked man to silence and for a long 3
hour he led me forward without needless words; making only the briefest of 3
comments concerning ancient names and dates and changes, and directing my 3
progress very largely by gestures as we squeezed through interstices, tiptoed 3
through corridors clambered over brick walls, and once crawled on hands and 3
knees through a low, arched passage of stone whose immense length and 3
tortuous twistings effaced at last every hint of geographical location I had 3
managed to preserve. The things we saw were very old and marvelous, or at 3
least they seemed so in the few straggling rays of light by which I viewed them, 3
and I shall never forget the tottering Ionic columns and fluted pilasters and urn- 3
headed iron fenceposts and flaring-linteled windows and decorative fanlights 3
that appeared to grow quainter and stranger the deeper we advanced into this 3
inexhaustible maze of unknown antiquity. 3
3
We met no person, and as time passed the lighted windows became fewer and 3
fewer. The streetlights we first encountered had been of oil, and of the ancient 3
lozenge pattern. Later I noticed some with candles; and at last, after traversing a 3
horrible unlighted court where my guide had to lead with his gloved hand 3
through total blackness to a narrow wooded gate in a high wall, we came upon a 3
fragment of alley lit only by lanterns in front of every seventh house - 3
unbelievably Colonial tin lanterns with conical tops and holes punched in the 3
sides. This alley led steeply uphill - more steeply than I thought possible in this 3
part of New York - and the upper end was blocked squarely by the ivy-clad wall 3
of a private estate, beyond which I could see a pale cupola, and the tops of trees 3
3
3
3
167 3
3
3
3
waving against a vague lightness in the sky. In this wall was a small, low-arched 3
gate of nail-studded black oak, which the man proceeded to unlock with a 3
ponderous key. Leading me within, he steered a course in utter blackness over 3
what seemed to be a gravel path, and finally up a flight of stone steps to the door 3
of the house, which he unlocked and opened for me. 3
3
We entered, and as we did so I grew faint from a reek of infinite mustiness which 3
welled out to meet us, and which must have been the fruit of unwholesome 3
centuries of decay. My host appeared not to notice this, and in courtesy I kept 3
silent as he piloted me up a curving stairway, across a hall, and into a room 3
whose door I heard him lock behind us. Then I saw him pull the curtains of the 3
three small-paned windows that barely showed themselves against the 3
lightening sky; after which he crossed to the mantel, struck flint and steel, lighted 3
two candles of a candelabrum of twelve sconces, and made a gesture enjoining 3
soft-toned speech. 3
3
In this feeble radiance I saw that we were in a spacious, well-furnished and 3
paneled library dating from the first quarter of the Eighteenth Century, with 3
splendid doorway pediments, a delightful Doric cornice, and a magnificently 3
carved overmantel with scroU-and-urn top. Above the crowded bookshelves at 3
intervals along the walls were well-wrought family portraits; all tarnished to an 3
enigmatical dimness, and bearing an unmistakable likeness to the man who now 3
motioned me to a chair beside the graceful Chippendale table. Before seating 3
himself across the table from me, my host paused for a moment as if in 3
embarrassment; then, tardily removing his gloves, wide-brimmed hat, and cloak, 3
stood theatrically revealed in full mid-Georgian costume from queued hair and 3
neck ruffles to knee-breeches, silk hose, and the buckled shoes I had not 3
previously noticed. Now slowly sinking into a lyre-back chair, he commenced to 3
eye me intently. 3
3
Without his hat he took on an aspect of extreme age which was scarcely visible 3
before, and I wondered if this unperceived mark of singular longevity were not 3
one of the sources of my disquiet. When he spoke at length, his soft, hollow, and 3
carefully muffled voice not infrequently quavered; and now and then I had great 3
difficulty in following him as I listened with a thrill of amazement and half- 3
disavowed alarm which grew each instant. 3
3
"You behold. Sir," my host began, "a man of very eccentrical habits for whose 3
costume no apology need be offered to one with your wit and inclinations. 3
Reflecting upon better times, I have not scrupled to ascertain their ways, and 3
adopt their dress and manners; an indulgence which offends none if practised 3
without ostentation. It hath been my good fortune to retain the rural seat of my 3
ancestors, swallowed though it was by two towns, first Greenwich, which built 3
3
3
3
168 3
3
3
3
up hither after 1800, then New York, which joined on near 1830. There were 3
many reasons for the close keeping of this place in my family, and I have not 3
been remiss in discharging such obligations. The squire who succeeded to it in 3
1768 studied sartain arts and made sartain discoveries, all connected with 3
influences residing in this particular plot of ground, and eminently desarving of 3
the strongest guarding. Some curious effects of these arts and discoveries I now 3
purpose to show you, under the strictest secrecy; and I believe I may rely on my 3
judgement of men enough to have no distrust of either your interest or your 3
fidelity." 3
3
He paused, but I could only nod my head. I have said that I was alarmed, yet to 3
my soul nothing was more deadly than the material daylight world of New York, 3
and whether this man were a harmless eccentric or a wielder of dangerous arts, I 3
had no choice save to follow him and slake my sense of wonder on whatever he 3
might have to offer. So I listened. 3
3
"To - my ancestor," he softly continued, "there appeared to reside some very 3
remarkable qualities in the will of mankind; qualities having a little-suspected 3
dominance not only over the acts of one's self and of others, but over every 3
variety of force and substance in Nature, and over many elements and 3
dimensions deemed more universal than Nature herself. May I say that he 3
flouted the sanctity of things as great as space and time and that he put to 3
strange uses the rites of sartain half-breed red Indians once encamped upon this 3
hill? These Indians showed choler when the place was built, and were plaguey 3
pestilent in asking to visit the grounds at the full of the moon. For years they 3
stole over the wall each month when they could, and by stealth performed 3
sartain acts. Then, in '68, the new squire catched them at their doings, and stood 3
still at what he saw. Thereafter he bargained with them and exchanged the free 3
access of his grounds for the exact inwardness of what they did, larning that their 3
grandfathers got part of their custom from red ancestors and part from an old 3
Dutchman in the time of the States-General. Arid pox on him, I'm afeared the 3
squire must have sarved them monstrous bad rum - whether or not by intent - 3
for a week after he larnt the secret he was the only man living that knew it. You, 3
Sir, are the first outsider to be told there is a secret, and split me if I'd have risked 3
tampering that much with - the powers - had ye not been so hot after bygone 3
things." 3
3
I shuddered as the man grew colloquial - and with the familiar speech of another 3
day. He went on. 3
3
"But you must know. Sir, that what - the squire - got from those mongrel savages 3
was but a small part of the larning he came to have. He had not been at Oxford 3
for nothing, nor talked to no account with an ancient chymist and astrologer in 3
3
3
3
169 3
3
3
3
Paris. He was, in fine, made sensible that all the world is but the smoke of our 3
intellects; past the bidding of the vulgar, but by the wise to be puffed out and 3
drawn in like any cloud of prime Virginia tobacco. What we want, we may make 3
about us; and what we don't want, we may sweep away. I won't say that all this 3
is wholly true in body, but 'tis sufficient true to furnish a very pretty spectacle 3
now and then. You, I conceive, would be tickled hy a better sight of sartain other 3
years than your fancy affords you; so be pleased to hold back any fright at what I 3
design to show. Come to the window and be quiet." 3
3
My host now took my hand to draw me to one of the two windows on the long 3
side of the malodorous room, and at the first touch of his ungloved fingers I 3
turned cold. His flesh, though dry and firm, was of the quality of ice; and I 3
almost shrank away from his pulling. But again I thought of the emptiness and 3
horror of reality, and boldly prepared to follow whithersoever I might be led. 3
Once at the window, the man drew apart the yellow silk curtains and directed 3
my stare into the blackness outside. For a moment I saw nothing save a myriad 3
of tiny dancing lights, far, far before me. Then, as if in response to an insidious 3
motion of my host's hand, a flash of heat-lightning played over the scene, and I 3
looked out upon a sea of luxuriant foliage - foliage unpolluted, and not the sea of 3
roofs to be expected by any normal mind. On my right the Hudson glittered 3
wickedly, and in the distance ahead I saw the unhealthy shimmer of a vast salt 3
marsh constellated with nervous fireflies. The flash died, and an evil smile 3
illumined the waxy face of the aged necromancer. 3
3
"That was before my time - before the new squire's time. Pray let us try again." 3
3
I was faint, even fainter than the hateful modernity of that accursed city had 3
made me. 3
3
"Good God!" I whispered, "can you do that for any time?" And as he nodded, 3
and bared the black stumps of what had once been yellow fangs, I clutched at the 3
curtains to prevent myself from falling. But he steadied me with that terrible, ice- 3
cold claw, and once more made his insidious gesture. 3
3
Again the lightning flashed - but this time upon a scene not wholly strange. It 3
was Greenwich, the Greenwich that used to be, with here and there a roof or row 3
of houses as we see it now, yet with lovely green lanes and fields and bits of 3
grassy common. The marsh still glittered beyond, but in the farther distance I 3
saw the steeples of what was then all of New York; Trinity and St. Paul's and the 3
Brick Church dominating their sisters, and a faint haze of wood smoke hovering 3
over the whole. I breathed hard, hut not so much from the sight itself as from the 3
possibilities my imagination terrifiedly conjured up. 3
3
3
3
170 3
3
3
3
"Can you - dare you - go far?" I spoke with awe and I think he shared it for a 3
second, but the evil grin returned. 3
3
"Far? What I have seen would blast ye to a mad statue of stone! Back, back - 3
forward, forward - look ye puling lackwit!" 3
3
And as he snarled the phrase under his breath he gestured anew bringing to the 3
sky a flash more blinding than either which had come before. For full three 3
seconds I could glimpse that pandemoniac sight, and in those seconds I saw a 3
vista which will ever afterward torment me in dreams. I saw the heavens 3
verminous with strange flying things, and beneath them a hellish black city of 3
giant stone terraces with impious pyramids flung savagely to the moon, and 3
devil-lights burning from unnumbered windows. And swarming loathsomely on 3
aerial galleries I saw the yellow, squint-eyed people of that city, robed horribly in 3
orange and red, and dancing insanely to the pounding of fevered kettle-drums, 3
the clatter of obscene crotala, and the maniacal moaning of muted horns whose 3
ceaseless dirges rose and fell undulantly like the wave of an unhallowed ocean of 3
bitumen. 3
3
I saw this vista, I say, and heard as with the mind's ear the blasphemous 3
domdaniel of cacophony which companioned it. It was the shrieking fulfilment 3
of all the horror which that corpse-city had ever stirred in my soul, and 3
forgetting every injunction to silence I screamed and screamed and screamed as 3
my nerves gave way and the walls quivered about me. 3
3
Then, as the flash subsided, I saw that my host was trembling too; a look of 3
shocking fear half-blotting from his face the serpent distortion of rage which my 3
screams had excited. He tottered, clutched at the curtains as I had done before, 3
and wriggled his head wildly, like a hunted animal. God knows he had cause, for 3
as the echoes of my screaming died away there came another sound so hellishly 3
suggestive that only numbed emotion kept me sane and conscious. It was the 3
steady, stealthy creaking of the stairs beyond the locked door, as with the ascent 3
of a barefoot or skin-shod horde; and at last the cautious, purposeful rattling of 3
the brass latch that glowed in the feeble candlelight. The old man clawed and 3
spat at me through the moldy air, and barked things in his throat as he swayed 3
with the yellow curtain he clutched. 3
3
"The full moon - damn ye - ye... ye yelping dog - ye called 'em, and they've 3
come for me! Moccasined feet - dead men - Gad sink ye, ye red devils, but I 3
poisoned no rum o' yours - han't I kept your pox-rotted magic safe - ye swilled 3
yourselves sick, curse ye, and yet must needs blame the squire - let go, you! 3
Unhand that latch - I've naught for ye here - " 3
3
3
3
171 3
3
3
3
At this point three slow and very dehberate raps shook the panels of the door, 3
and a white foam gathered at the mouth of the frantic magician. His fright, 3
turning to steely despair, left room for a resurgence of his rage against me; and 3
he staggered a step toward the table on whose edge I was steadying myself. The 3
curtains, still clutched in his right hand as his left clawed out at me, grew taut 3
and finally crashed down from their lofty fastenings; admitting to the room a 3
flood of that full moonlight which the brightening of the sky had presaged. In 3
those greenish beams the candles paled, and a new semblance of decay spread 3
over the musk-reeking room with its wormy paneling, sagging floor, battered 3
mantel, rickety furniture, and ragged draperies. It spread over the old man, too, 3
whether from the same source or because of his fear and vehemence, and I saw 3
him shrivel and blacken as he lurched near and strove to rend me with vulturine 3
talons. Only his eyes stayed whole, and they glared with a propulsive, dilated 3
incandescence which grew as the face around them charred and dwindled. 3
3
The rapping was now repeated with greater insistence, and this time bore a hint 3
of metal. The black thing facing me had become only a head with eyes, 3
impotently trying to wriggle across the sinking floor in my direction, and 3
occasionally emitting feeble little spits of immortal malice. Now swift and 3
splintering blows assailed the sickly panels, and I saw the gleam of a tomahawk 3
as it cleft the rending wood. I did not move, for I could not; but watched dazedly 3
as the door fell in pieces to admit a colossal, shapeless influx of inky substance 3
starred with shining, malevolent eyes. It poured thickly, like a flood of oil 3
bursting a rotten bulkhead, overturned a chair as it spread, and finally flowed 3
under the table and across the room to where the blackened head with the eyes 3
still glared at me. Around that head it closed, totally swallowing it up, and in 3
another moment it had begun to recede; bearing away its invisible burden 3
without touching me, and flowing again out that black doorway and down the 3
unseen stairs, which creaked as before, though in reverse order. 3
3
Then the floor gave way at last, and I slid gaspingly down into the nighted 3
chamber below, choking with cobwebs and half-swooning with terror. The green 3
moon, shining through broken windows, showed me the hall door half open; 3
and as I rose from the plaster-strewn floor and twisted myself free from the 3
sagged ceiling, I saw sweep past it an awful torrent of blackness, with scores of 3
baleful eyes glowing in it. It was seeking the door to the cellar, and when it 3
found it, vanished therein. I now felt the floor of this lower room giving as that of 3
the upper chamber had done, and once a crashing above had been followed by 3
the fall past the west window of some thing which must have been the cupola. 3
Now liberated for the instant from the wreckage, I rushed through the hall to the 3
front door and finding myself unable to open it, seized a chair and broke a 3
window, climbing frenziedly out upon the unkempt lawn where moon light 3
danced over yard-high grass and weeds. The wall was high and all the gates 3
3
3
3
172 3
3
3
3
were locked but moving a pile of boxes in a corner I managed to gain the top and 3
cling to the great stone urn set there. 3
3
About me in my exhaustion I could see only strange walls and windows and old 3
gambrel roofs. The steep street of my approach was nowhere visible, and the 3
little I did see succumbed rapidly to a mist that rolled in from the river despite 3
the glaring moonlight. Suddenly the urn to which I clung began to tremble, as if 3
sharing my own lethal dizziness; and in another instant my body was plunging 3
downward to I knew not what fate. 3
3
The man who found me said that I must have crawled a long way despite my 3
broken bones, for a trail of blood stretched off as far as he dared look. The 3
gathering rain soon effaced this link with the scene of my ordeal, and reports 3
could state no more than that I had appeared from a place unknown, at the 3
entrance to a little black court off Perry Street. 3
3
I never sought to return to those tenebrous labyrinths, nor would I direct any 3
sane man thither if I could. Of who or what that ancient creature was, I have no 3
idea; but I repeat that the city is dead and full of unsuspected horrors. Whither 3
he has gone, I do not know; but I have gone home to the pure New England 3
lanes up which fragrant sea-winds sweep at evening. 3

3
Of Herbert West, who was my friend in college and in after life, I can speak only 3
with extreme terror. This terror is not due altogether to the sinister manner of his 3
recent disappearance, but was engendered by the whole nature of his life-work, 3
and first gained its acute form more than seventeen years ago, when we were in 3
the third year of our course at the Miskatonic University Medical School in 3
Arkham. While he was with me, the wonder and diabolism of his experiments 3
fascinated me utterly, and I was his closest companion. Now that he is gone and 3
the spell is broken, the actual fear is greater. Memories and possibilities are ever 3
more hideous than realities. 3
3
The first horrible incident of our acquaintance was the greatest shock I ever 3
experienced, and it is only with reluctance that I repeat it. As I have said, it 3
happened when we were in the medical school where West had already made 3
himself notorious through his wild theories on the nature of death and the 3
possibility of overcoming it artificially. His views, which were widely ridiculed 3
by the faculty and by his fellow-students, hinged on the essentially mechanistic 3
nature of life; and concerned means for operating the organic machinery of 3
mankind by calculated chemical action after the failure of natural processes. In 3
his experiments with various animating solutions, he had killed and treated 3
immense numbers of rabbits, guinea-pigs, cats, dogs, and monkeys, till he had 3
become the prime nuisance of the college. Several times he had actually obtained 3
signs of life in animals supposedly dead; in many cases violent signs but he soon 3
saw that the perfection of his process, if indeed possible, would necessarily 3
involve a lifetime of research. It likewise became clear that, since the same 3
solution never worked alike on different organic species, he would require 3
human subjects for further and more specialised progress. It was here that he 3
first came into conflict with the college authorities, and was debarred from future 3
experiments by no less a dignitary than the dean of the medical school himself — 3
the learned and benevolent Dr. Allan Halsey, whose work in behalf of the 3
stricken is recalled by every old resident of Arkham. 3

3
I had always been exceptionally tolerant of West's pursuits, and we frequently 3
discussed his theories, whose ramifications and corollaries were almost infinite. 3
Holding with Haeckel that all life is a chemical and physical process, and that the 3
so-called "soul" is a myth, my friend believed that artificial reanimation of the 3
dead can depend only on the condition of the tissues; and that unless actual 3
decomposition has set in, a corpse fully equipped with organs may with suitable 3
measures be set going again in the peculiar fashion known as life. That the 3
psychic or intellectual life might be impaired by the slight deterioration of 3
sensitive brain-cells which even a short period of death would be apt to cause. 3
West fully realised. It had at first been his hope to find a reagent which would 3
restore vitality before the actual advent of death, and only repeated failures on 3
animals had shewn him that the natural and artificial life-motions were 3
incompatible. He then sought extreme freshness in his specimens, injecting his 3
solutions into the blood immediately after the extinction of life. It was this 3
circumstance which made the professors so carelessly sceptical, for they felt that 3
true death had not occurred in any case. They did not stop to view the matter 3
closely and reasoningly. 3
3
It was not long after the faculty had interdicted his work that West confided to 3
me his resolution to get fresh human bodies in some manner, and continue in 3
secret the experiments he could no longer perform openly. To hear him 3
discussing ways and means was rather ghastly, for at the college we had never 3
procured anatomical specimens ourselves. Whenever the morgue proved 3
inadequate, two local negroes attended to this matter, and they were seldom 3
questioned. West was then a small, slender, spectacled youth with delicate 3
features, yellow hair, pale blue eyes, and a soft voice, and it was uncanny to hear 3
him dwelling on the relative merits of Christchurch Cemetery and the potter's 3
field. We finally decided on the potter's field, because practically every body in 3
Christchurch was embalmed; a thing of course ruinous to West's researches. 3
3
I was by this time his active and enthralled assistant, and helped him make all 3
his decisions, not only concerning the source of bodies but concerning a suitable 3
place for our loathsome work. It was I who thought of the deserted Chapman 3
farmhouse beyond Meadow Hill, where we fitted up on the ground floor an 3
operating room and a laboratory, each with dark curtains to conceal our 3
midnight doings. The place was far from any road, and in sight of no other 3
house, yet precautions were none the less necessary; since rumours of strange 3
lights, started by chance nocturnal roamers, would soon bring disaster on our 3
enterprise. It was agreed to call the whole thing a chemical laboratory if 3
discovery should occur. Gradually we equipped our sinister haunt of science 3
with materials either purchased in Boston or quietly borrowed from the college 3
— materials carefully made unrecognisable save to expert eyes — and provided 3
spades and picks for the many burials we should have to make in the cellar. At 3

3
the college we used an incinerator, but the apparatus was too costly for our 3
unauthorised laboratory. Bodies were always a nuisance — even the small 3
guinea-pig bodies from the slight clandestine experiments in West's room at the 3
boarding-house. 3
3
We followed the local death-notices like ghouls, for our specimens demanded 3
particular qualities. What we wanted were corpses interred soon after death and 3
without artificial preservation; preferably free from malforming disease, and 3
certainly with all organs present. Accident victims were our best hope. Not for 3
many weeks did we hear of anything suitable; though we talked with morgue 3
and hospital authorities, ostensibly in the college's interest, as often as we could 3
without exciting suspicion. We found that the college had first choice in every 3
case, so that it might be necessary to remain in Arkham during the summer, 3
when only the limited summer-school classes were held. In the end, though, luck 3
favoured us; for one day we heard of an almost ideal case in the potter's field; a 3
brawny young workman drowned only the morning before in Summer's Pond, 3
and buried at the town's expense without delay or embalming. That afternoon 3
we found the new grave, and determined to begin work soon after midnight. It 3
was a repulsive task that we undertook in the black small hours, even though we 3
lacked at that time the special horror of graveyards which later experiences 3
brought to us. We carried spades and oil dark lanterns, for although electric 3
torches were then manufactured, they were not as satisfactory as the tungsten 3
contrivances of today. The process of unearthing was slow and sordid — it might 3
have been gruesomely poetical if we had been artists instead of scientists — and 3
we were glad when our spades struck wood. When the pine box was fully 3
uncovered. West scrambled down and removed the lid, dragging out and 3
propping up the contents. I reached down and hauled the contents out of the 3
grave, and then both toiled hard to restore the spot to its former appearance. The 3
affair made us rather nervous, especially the stiff form and vacant face of our 3
first trophy, but we managed to remove all traces of our visit. When we had 3
patted down the last shovelful of earth, we put the specimen in a canvas sack 3
and set out for the old Chapman place beyond Meadow Hill. 3
3
On an improvised dissecting-table in the old farmhouse, by the light of a 3
powerful acetylene lamp, the specimen was not very spectral looking. It had 3
been a sturdy and apparently unimaginative youth of wholesome plebeian type 3
— large-framed, grey-eyed, and brown-haired — a sound animal without 3
psychological subtleties, and probably having vital processes of the simplest and 3
healthiest sort. Now, with the eyes closed, it looked more asleep than dead; 3
though the expert test of my friend soon left no doubt on that score. We had at 3
last what West had always longed for — a real dead man of the ideal kind, ready 3
for the solution as prepared according to the most careful calculations and 3
theories for human use. The tension on our part became very great. We knew 3
3
3
3
176 3
3
3
3
that there was scarcely a chance for anything hke complete success, and could 3
not avoid hideous fears at possible grotesque results of partial animation. 3
Especially were we apprehensive concerning the mind and impulses of the 3
creature, since in the space following death some of the more delicate cerebral 3
cells might well have suffered deterioration. I, myself, still held some curious 3
notions about the traditional "soul" of man, and felt an awe at the secrets that 3
might be told by one returning from the dead. I wondered what sights this placid 3
youth might have seen in inaccessible spheres, and what he could relate if fully 3
restored to life. But my wonder was not overwhelming, since for the most part I 3
shared the materialism of my friend. He was calmer than I as he forced a large 3
quantity of his fluid into a vein of the body's arm, immediately binding the 3
incision securely. 3
3
The waiting was gruesome, but West never faltered. Every now and then he 3
applied his stethoscope to the specimen, and bore the negative results 3
philosophically. After about three-quarters of an hour without the least sign of 3
life he disappointedly pronounced the solution inadequate, but determined to 3
make the most of his opportunity and try one change in the formula before 3
disposing of his ghastly prize. We had that afternoon dug a grave in the cellar, 3
and would have to fill it by dawn — for although we had fixed a lock on the 3
house, we wished to shun even the remotest risk of a ghoulish discovery. 3
Besides, the body would not be even approximately fresh the next night. So 3
taking the solitary acetylene lamp into the adjacent laboratory, we left our silent 3
guest on the slab in the dark, and bent every energy to the mixing of a new 3
solution; the weighing and measuring supervised by West with an almost 3
fanatical care. 3
3
The awful event was very sudden, and wholly unexpected. I was pouring 3
something from one test-tube to another, and West was busy over the alcohol 3
blast-lamp which had to answer for a Bunsen burner in this gasless edifice, when 3
from the pitch-black room we had left there burst the most appalling and 3
daemoniac succession of cries that either of us had ever heard. Not more 3
unutterable could have been the chaos of hellish sound if the pit itself had 3
opened to release the agony of the damned, for in one inconceivable cacophony 3
was centered all the supernal terror and unnatural despair of animate nature. 3
Human it could not have been — it is not in man to make such sounds — and 3
without a thought of our late employment or its possible discovery, both West 3
and I leaped to the nearest window like stricken animals; overturning tubes, 3
lamp, and retorts, and vaulting madly into the starred abyss of the rural night. I 3
think we screamed ourselves as we stumbled frantically toward the town, 3
though as we reached the outskirts we put on a semblance of restraint — just 3
enough to seem like belated revellers staggering home from a debauch. 3
3
3
3
177 3
3
3
3
We did not separate, but managed to get to West's room, where we whispered 3
with the gas up until dawn. By then we had calmed ourselves a little with 3
rational theories and plans for investigation, so that we could sleep through the 3
day — classes being disregarded. But that evening two items in the paper, 3
wholly unrelated, made it again impossible for us to sleep. The old deserted 3
Chapman house had inexplicably burned to an amorphous heap of ashes; that 3
we could understand because of the upset lamp. Also, an attempt had been made 3
to disturb a new grave in the potter's field, as if by futile and spadeless clawing 3
at the earth. That we could not understand, for we had patted down the mould 3
very carefully. 3
3
And for seventeen years after that West would look frequently over his shoulder, 3
and complain of fancied footsteps behind him. Now he has disappeared. 3

3
I shall never forget that hideous summer sixteen years ago, when like a noxious 3
afrite from the halls of Eblis typhoid stalked leeringly through Arkham. It is by 3
that Satanic scourge that most recall the year, for truly terror brooded with bat- 3
wings over the piles of coffins in the tombs of Christchurch Cemetery; yet for me 3
there is a greater horror in that time — a horror known to me alone now that 3
Herbert West has disappeared. 3
3
West and I were doing post-graduate work in summer classes at the medical 3
school of Miskatonic University, and my friend had attained a wide notoriety 3
because of his experiments leading toward the revivification of the dead. After 3
the scientific slaughter of uncounted small animals the freakish work had 3
ostensibly stopped by order of our sceptical dean. Dr. Allan Halsey; though West 3
had continued to perform certain secret tests in his dingy boarding-house room, 3
and had on one terrible and unforgettable occasion taken a human body from its 3
grave in the potter's field to a deserted farmhouse beyond Meadow Hill. 3
3
I was with him on that odious occasion, and saw him inject into the still veins the 3
elixir which he thought would to some extent restore life's chemical and physical 3
processes. It had ended horribly — in a delirium of fear which we gradually 3
came to attribute to our own overwrought nerves — and West had never 3
afterward been able to shake off a maddening sensation of being haunted and 3
hunted. The body had not been quite fresh enough; it is obvious that to restore 3
normal mental attributes a body must be very fresh indeed; and the burning of 3
the old house had prevented us from burying the thing. It would have been 3
better if we could have known it was underground. 3
3
3
3
178 3
3
3
3
After that experience West had dropped his researches for some time; but as the 3
zeal of the born scientist slowly returned, he again became importunate with the 3
college faculty, pleading for the use of the dissecting-room and of fresh human 3
specimens for the work he regarded as so overwhelmingly important. His pleas, 3
however, were wholly in vain; for the decision of Dr. Halsey was inflexible, and 3
the other professors all endorsed the verdict of their leader. In the radical theory 3
of reanimation they saw nothing but the immature vagaries of a youthful 3
enthusiast whose slight form, yellow hair, spectacled blue eyes, and soft voice 3
gave no hint of the supernormal — almost diabolical — power of the cold brain 3
within. I can see him now as he was then — and I shiver. He grew sterner of face, 3
but never elderly. And now Sefton Asylum has had the mishap and West has 3
vanished. 3
3
West clashed disagreeably with Dr. Halsey near the end of our last 3
undergraduate term in a wordy dispute that did less credit to him than to the 3
kindiy dean in point of courtesy. He felt that he was needlessly and irrationally 3
retarded in a supremely great work; a work which he could of course conduct to 3
suit himself in later years, but which he wished to begin while still possessed of 3
the exceptional facilities of the university. That the tradition-bound elders should 3
ignore his singular results on animals, and persist in their denial of the 3
possibility of reanimation, was inexpressibly disgusting and almost 3
incomprehensible to a youth of West's logical temperament. Only greater 3
maturity could help him understand the chronic mental limitations of the 3
"professor-doctor" type — the product of generations of pathetic Puritanism; 3
kindly, conscientious, and sometimes gentle and amiable, yet always narrow, 3
intolerant, custom-ridden, and lacking in perspective. Age has more charity for 3
these incomplete yet high-souled characters, whose worst real vice is timidity, 3
and who are ultimately punished by general ridicule for their intellectual sins — 3
sins like Ptolemaism, Calvinism, anti-Darwinism, anti-Nietzscheism, and every 3
sort of Sabbatarianism and sumptuary legislation. West, young despite his 3
marvellous scientific acquirements, had scant patience with good Dr. Halsey and 3
his erudite colleagues; and nursed an increasing resentment, coupled with a 3
desire to prove his theories to these obtuse worthies in some striking and 3
dramatic fashion. Like most youths, he indulged in elaborate daydreams of 3
revenge, triumph, and final magnanimous forgiveness. 3
3
And then had come the scourge, grinning and lethal, from the nightmare caverns 3
of Tartarus. West and I had graduated about the time of its beginning, but had 3
remained for additional work at the summer school, so that we were in Arkham 3
when it broke with full daemoniac fury upon the town. Though not as yet 3
licenced physicians, we now had our degrees, and were pressed frantically into 3
public service as the numbers of the stricken grew. The situation was almost past 3
management, and deaths ensued too frequently for the local undertakers fully to 3
3
3
3
179 3
3
3
3
handle. Burials without embalming were made in rapid succession, and even the 3
Christchurch Cemetery receiving tomb was crammed with coffins of the 3
unembalmed dead. This circumstance was not without effect on West, who 3
thought often of the irony of the situation — so many fresh specimens, yet none 3
for his persecuted researches! We were frightfully overworked, and the terrific 3
mental and nervous strain made my friend brood morbidly. 3
3
But West's gentle enemies were no less harassed with prostrating duties. College 3
had all but closed, and every doctor of the medical faculty was helping to fight 3
the typhoid plague. Dr. Halsey in particular had distinguished himself in 3
sacrificing service, applying his extreme skill with whole-hearted energy to cases 3
which many others shunned because of danger or apparent hopelessness. Before 3
a month was over the fearless dean had become a popular hero, though he 3
seemed unconscious of his fame as he struggled to keep from collapsing with 3
physical fatigue and nervous exhaustion. West could not withhold admiration 3
for the fortitude of his foe, but because of this was even more determined to 3
prove to him the truth of his amazing doctrines. Taking advantage of the 3
disorganisation of both college work and municipal health regulations, he 3
managed to get a recently deceased body smuggled into the university 3
dissecting-room one night, and in my presence injected a new modification of his 3
solution. The thing actually opened its eyes, but only stared at the ceiling with a 3
look of soul-petrifying horror before collapsing into an inertness from which 3
nothing could rouse it. West said it was not fresh enough — the hot summer air 3
does not favour corpses. That time we were almost caught before we incinerated 3
the thing, and West doubted the advisability of repeating his daring misuse of 3
the college laboratory. 3
3
The peak of the epidemic was reached in August. West and I were almost dead, 3
and Dr. Halsey did die on the 14th. The students all attended the hasty funeral 3
on the 15th, and bought an impressive wreath, though the latter was quite 3
overshadowed by the tributes sent by wealthy Arkham citizens and by the 3
municipality itself. It was almost a public affair, for the dean had surely been a 3
public benefactor. After the entombment we were all somewhat depressed, and 3
spent the afternoon at the bar of the Commercial House; where West, though 3
shaken by the death of his chief opponent, chilled the rest of us with references to 3
his notorious theories. Most of the students went home, or to various duties, as 3
the evening advanced; but West persuaded me to aid him in "making a night of 3
it." West's landlady saw us arrive at his room about two in the morning, with a 3
third man between us; and told her husband that we had all evidently dined and 3
wined rather well. 3
3
Apparently this acidulous matron was right; for about 3 a.m. the whole house 3
was aroused by cries coming from West's room, where when they broke down 3
3
3
3
180 3
3
3
3
the door, they found the two of us unconscious on the blood-stained carpet, 3
beaten, scratched, and mauled, and with the broken remnants of West's bottles 3
and instruments around us. Only an open window told what had become of our 3
assailant, and many wondered how he himself had fared after the terrific leap 3
from the second story to the lawn which he must have made. There were some 3
strange garments in the room, but West upon regaining consciousness said they 3
did not belong to the stranger, but were specimens collected for bacteriological 3
analysis in the course of investigations on the transmission of germ diseases. He 3
ordered them burnt as soon as possible in the capacious fireplace. To the police 3
we both declared ignorance of our late companion's identity. He was. West 3
nervously said, a congenial stranger whom we had met at some downtown bar 3
of uncertain location. We had all been rather jovial, and West and I did not wish 3
to have our pugnacious companion hunted down. 3
3
That same night saw the beginning of the second Arkham horror — the horror 3
that to me eclipsed the plague itself. Christchurch Cemetery was the scene of a 3
terrible killing; a watchman having been clawed to death in a manner not only 3
too hideous for description, but raising a doubt as to the human agency of the 3
deed. The victim had been seen alive considerably after midnight — the dawn 3
revealed the unutterable thing. The manager of a circus at the neighbouring town 3
of Bolton was questioned, but he swore that no beast had at any time escaped 3
from its cage. Those who found the body noted a trail of blood leading to the 3
receiving tomb, where a small pool of red lay on the concrete just outside the 3
gate. A fainter trail led away toward the woods, but it soon gave out. 3
3
The next night devils danced on the roofs of Arkham, and unnatural madness 3
howled in the wind. Through the fevered town had crept a curse which some 3
said was greater than the plague, and which some whispered was the embodied 3
daemon-soul of the plague itself. Eight houses were entered by a nameless thing 3
which strewed red death in its wake — in all, seventeen maimed and shapeless 3
remnants of bodies were left behind by the voiceless, sadistic monster that crept 3
abroad. A few persons had half seen it in the dark, and said it was white and like 3
a malformed ape or anthropomorphic fiend. It had not left behind quite all that it 3
had attacked, for sometimes it had been hungry. The number it had killed was 3
fourteen; three of the bodies had been in stricken homes and had not been alive. 3
3
On the third night frantic bands of searchers, led by the police, captured it in a 3
house on Crane Street near the Miskatonic campus. They had organised the quest 3
with care, keeping in touch by means of volunteer telephone stations, and when 3
someone in the college district had reported hearing a scratching at a shuttered 3
window, the net was quickly spread. On account of the general alarm and 3
precautions, there were only two more victims, and the capture was effected 3
without major casualties. The thing was finally stopped by a bullet, though not a 3
3
3
3
181 3
3
3
3
fatal one, and was rushed to the local hospital amidst universal excitement and 3
loathing. 3
3
For it had been a man. This much was clear despite the nauseous eyes, the 3
voiceless simianism, and the daemoniac savagery. They dressed its wound and 3
carted it to the asylum at Sefton, where it beat its head against the walls of a 3
padded cell for sixteen years — until the recent mishap, when it escaped under 3
circumstances that few like to mention. What had most disgusted the searchers 3
of Arkham was the thing they noticed when the monster's face was cleaned — 3
the mocking, unbelievable resemblance to a learned and self-sacrificing martyr 3
who had been entombed but three days before — the late Dr. Allan Halsey, 3
public benefactor and dean of the medical school of Miskatonic University. 3
3
To the vanished Herbert West and to me the disgust and horror were supreme. I 3
shudder tonight as I think of it; shudder even more than I did that morning 3
when West muttered through his bandages, "Damn it, it wasn't quite fresh 3
enough!" 3

3
It is uncommon to fire all six shots of a revolver with great suddenness when one 3
would probably be sufficient, but many things in the life of Herbert West were 3
uncommon. It is, for instance, not often that a young physician leaving college is 3
obliged to conceal the principles which guide his selection of a home and office, 3
yet that was the case with Herbert West. When he and I obtained our degrees at 3
the medical school of Miskatonic University, and sought to relieve our poverty 3
by setting up as general practitioners, we took great care not to say that we chose 3
our house because it was fairly well isolated, and as near as possible to the 3
potter's field. 3
3
Reticence such as this is seldom without a cause, nor indeed was ours; for our 3
requirements were those resulting from a life-work distinctly unpopular. 3
Outwardly we were doctors only, but beneath the surface were aims of far 3
greater and more terrible moment — for the essence of Herbert West's existence 3
was a quest amid black and forbidden realms of the unknown, in which he 3
hoped to uncover the secret of life and restore to perpetual animation the 3
graveyard's cold clay. Such a quest demands strange materials, among them 3
fresh human bodies; and in order to keep supplied with these indispensable 3
things one must live quietly and not far from a place of informal interment. 3

3
West and I had met in college, and I had been the only one to sympathise with 3
his hideous experiments. Gradually I had come to be his inseparable assistant, 3
and now that we were out of college we had to keep together. It was not easy to 3
find a good opening for two doctors in company, but finally the influence of the 3
university secured us a practice in Bolton — a factory town near Arkham, the 3
seat of the college. The Bolton Worsted Mills are the largest in the Miskatonic 3
Valley, and their polyglot employees are never popular as patients with the local 3
physicians. We chose our house with the greatest care, seizing at last on a rather 3
run-down cottage near the end of Pond Street; five numbers from the closest 3
neighbour, and separated from the local potter's field by only a stretch of 3
meadow land, bisected by a narrow neck of the rather dense forest which lies to 3
the north. The distance was greater than we wished, but we could get no nearer 3
house without going on the other side of the field, wholly out of the factory 3
district. We were not much displeased, however, since there were no people 3
between us and our sinister source of supplies. The walk was a trifle long, but we 3
could haul our silent specimens undisturbed. 3
3
Our practice was surprisingly large from the very first — large enough to please 3
most young doctors, and large enough to prove a bore and a burden to students 3
whose real interest lay elsewhere. The mill-hands were of somewhat turbulent 3
inclinations; and besides their many natural needs, their frequent clashes and 3
stabbing affrays gave us plenty to do. But what actually absorbed our minds was 3
the secret laboratory we had fitted up in the cellar — the laboratory with the long 3
table under the electric lights, where in the small hours of the morning we often 3
injected West's various solutions into the veins of the things we dragged from 3
the potter's field. West was experimenting madly to find something which 3
would start man's vital motions anew after they had been stopped by the thing 3
we call death, but had encountered the most ghastly obstacles. The solution had 3
to be differently compounded for different types — what would serve for 3
guinea-pigs would not serve for human beings, and different human specimens 3
required large modifications. 3
3
The bodies had to be exceedingly fresh, or the slight decomposition of brain 3
tissue would render perfect reanimation impossible. Indeed, the greatest 3
problem was to get them fresh enough — West had had horrible experiences 3
during his secret college researches with corpses of doubtful vintage. The results 3
of partial or imperfect animation were much more hideous than were the total 3
failures, and we both held fearsome recollections of such things. Ever since our 3
first daemoniac session in the deserted farmhouse on Meadow Hill in Arkham, 3
we had felt a brooding menace; and West, though a calm, blond, blue-eyed 3
scientific automaton in most respects, often confessed to a shuddering sensation 3
of stealthy pursuit. He half felt that he was followed — a psychological delusion 3
of shaken nerves, enhanced by the undeniably disturbing fact that at least one of 3
3
3
3
183 3
3
3
3
our reanimated specimens was still alive — a frightful carnivorous thing in a 3
padded cell at Sefton. Then there was another — our first — whose exact fate we 3
had never learned. 3
3
We had fair luck with specimens in Bolton — much better than in Arkham. We 3
had not been settled a week before we got an accident victim on the very night of 3
burial, and made it open its eyes with an amazingly rational expression before 3
the solution failed. It had lost an arm — if it had been a perfect body we might 3
have succeeded better. Between then and the next January we secured three 3
more; one total failure, one case of marked muscular motion, and one rather 3
shivery thing — it rose of itself and uttered a sound. Then came a period when 3
luck was poor; interments fell off, and those that did occur were of specimens 3
either too diseased or too maimed for use. We kept track of all the deaths and 3
their circumstances with systematic care. 3
3
One March night, however, we unexpectedly obtained a specimen which did not 3
come from the potter's field. In Bolton the prevailing spirit of Puritanism had 3
outlawed the sport of boxing — with the usual result. Surreptitious and ill- 3
conducted bouts among the mill-workers were common, and occasionally 3
professional talent of low grade was imported. This late winter night there had 3
been such a match; evidently with disastrous results, since two timorous Poles 3
had come to us with incoherently whispered entreaties to attend to a very secret 3
and desperate case. We followed them to an abandoned barn, where the 3
remnants of a crowd of frightened foreigners were watching a silent black form 3
on the floor. 3
3
The match had been between Kid O'Brien — a lubberly and now quaking youth 3
with a most un-Hibernian hooked nose — and Buck Robinson, "The Harlem 3
Smoke." The negro had been knocked out, and a moment's examination shewed 3
us that he would permanently remain so. He was a loathsome, gorilla-like thing, 3
with abnormally long arms which I could not help calling fore legs, and a face 3
that conjured up thoughts of unspeakable Congo secrets and tom-tom poundings 3
under an eerie moon. The body must have looked even worse in life — but the 3
world holds many ugly things. Fear was upon the whole pitiful crowd, for they 3
did not know what the law would exact of them if the affair were not hushed up; 3
and they were grateful when West, in spite of my involuntary shudders, offered 3
to get rid of the thing quietly — for a purpose I knew too well. 3
3
There was bright moonlight over the snowless landscape, but we dressed the 3
thing and carried it home between us through the deserted streets and meadows, 3
as we had carried a similar thing one horrible night in Arkham. We approached 3
the house from the field in the rear, took the specimen in the back door and 3
down the cellar stairs, and prepared it for the usual experiment. Our fear of the 3
3
3
3
184 3
3
3
3
police was absurdly great, though we had timed our trip to avoid the solitary 3
patrolman of that section. 3
3
The result was wearily anticlimactic. Ghastly as our prize appeared, it was 3
wholly unresponsive to every solution we injected in its black arm; solutions 3
prepared from experience with white specimens only. So as the hour grew 3
dangerously near to dawn, we did as we had done with the others — dragged 3
the thing across the meadows to the neck of the woods near the potter's field, 3
and buried it there in the best sort of grave the frozen ground would furnish. The 3
grave was not very deep, but fully as good as that of the previous specimen — 3
the thing which had risen of itself and uttered a sound. In the light of our dark 3
lanterns we carefully covered it with leaves and dead vines, fairly certain that the 3
police would never find it in a forest so dim and dense. 3
3
The next day I was increasingly apprehensive about the police, for a patient 3
brought rumours of a suspected fight and death. West had still another source of 3
worry, for he had been called in the afternoon to a case which ended very 3
threateningly. An Italian woman had become hysterical over her missing child — 3
a lad of five who had strayed off early in the morning and failed to appear for 3
dinner — and had developed symptoms highly alarming in view of an always 3
weak heart. It was a very foolish hysteria, for the boy had often run away before; 3
but Italian peasants are exceedingly superstitious, and this woman seemed as 3
much harassed by omens as by facts. About seven o'clock in the evening she had 3
died, and her frantic husband had made a frightful scene in his efforts to kill 3
West, whom he wildly blamed for not saving her life. Friends had held him 3
when he drew a stiletto, but West departed amidst his inhuman shrieks, curses 3
and oaths of vengeance. In his latest affliction the fellow seemed to have 3
forgotten his child, who was still missing as the night advanced. There was some 3
talk of searching the woods, but most of the family's friends were busy with the 3
dead woman and the screaming man. Altogether, the nervous strain upon West 3
must have been tremendous. Thoughts of the police and of the mad Italian both 3
weighed heavily. 3
3
We retired about eleven, but I did not sleep well. Bolton had a surprisingly good 3
police force for so small a town, and I could not help fearing the mess which 3
would ensue if the affair of the night before were ever tracked down. It might 3
mean the end of all our local work — and perhaps prison for both West and me. I 3
did not like those rumours of a fight which were floating about. After the clock 3
had struck three the moon shone in my eyes, but I turned over without rising to 3
pull down the shade. Then came the steady rattling at the back door. 3
3
I lay still and somewhat dazed, but before long heard West's rap on my door. He 3
was clad in dressing- gown and slippers, and had in his hands a revolver and an 3
3
3
3

3
3
3
electric flashlight. From the revolver I knew that he was thinking more of the 3
crazed Italian than of the police. 3
3
"We'd better both go/' he whispered. "It wouldn't do not to answer it anyway, 3
and it may be a patient — it would be like one of those fools to try the back 3
door." 3
3
So we both went down the stairs on tiptoe, with a fear partly justified and partly 3
that which comes only from the soul of the weird small hours. The rattling 3
continued, growing somewhat louder. When we reached the door I cautiously 3
unbolted it and threw it open, and as the moon streamed revealingly down on 3
the form silhouetted there. West did a peculiar thing. Despite the obvious danger 3
of attracting notice and bringing down on our heads the dreaded police 3
investigation — a thing which after all was mercifully averted by the relative 3
isolation of our cottage — my friend suddenly, excitedly, and unnecessarily 3
emptied all six chambers of his revolver into the nocturnal visitor. 3
3
For that visitor was neither Italian nor policeman. Looming hideously against the 3
spectral moon was a gigantic misshapen thing not to be imagined save in 3
nightmares — a glassy-eyed, ink-black apparition nearly on all fours, covered 3
with bits of mould, leaves, and vines, foul with caked blood, and having between 3
its glistening teeth a snow-white, terrible, cylindrical object terminating in a tiny 3
hand. 3

IV. The Scream of the Dead 3
3
Pubhshed May 1922 in Home Brew Vol. 1, No. 4, p. 53-58. 3
3
The scream of a dead man gave to me that acute and added horror of Dr. Herbert 3
West which harassed the latter years of our companionship. It is natural that 3
such a thing as a dead man's scream should give horror, for it is obviously, not a 3
pleasing or ordinary occurrence; but I was used to similar experiences, hence 3
suffered on this occasion only because of a particular circumstance. And, as I 3
have implied, it was not of the dead man himself that I became afraid. 3
3
Herbert West, whose associate and assistant I was, possessed scientific interests 3
far beyond the usual routine of a village physician. That was why, when 3
establishing his practice in Bolton, he had chosen an isolated house near the 3
potter's field. Briefly and brutally stated. West's sole absorbing interest was a 3
secret study of the phenomena of life and its cessation, leading toward the 3
reanimation of the dead through injections of an excitant solution. For this 3
ghastly experimenting it was necessary to have a constant supply of very fresh 3
human bodies; very fresh because even the least decay hopelessly damaged the 3
3
3
3
186 3
3
3
3
brain structure, and human because we found that the solution had to be 3
compounded differently for different types of organisms. Scores of rabbits and 3
guinea-pigs had been killed and treated, but their trail was a blind one. West had 3
never fully succeeded because he had never been able to secure a corpse 3
sufficiently fresh. What he wanted were bodies from which vitality had only just 3
departed; bodies with every cell intact and capable of receiving again the 3
impulse toward that mode of motion called life. There was hope that this second 3
and artificial life might be made perpetual by repetitions of the injection, but we 3
had learned that an ordinary natural life would not respond to the action. To 3
establish the artificial motion, natural life must be extinct — the specimens must 3
be very fresh, but genuinely dead. 3
3
The awesome quest had begun when West and I were students at the Miskatonic 3
University Medical School in Arkham, vividly conscious for the first time of the 3
thoroughly mechanical nature of life. That was seven years before, but West 3
looked scarcely a day older now — he was small, blond, clean-shaven, soft- 3
voiced, and spectacled, with only an occasional flash of a cold blue eye to tell of 3
the hardening and growing fanaticism of his character under the pressure of his 3
terrible investigations. Our experiences had often been hideous in the extreme; 3
the results of defective reanimation, when lumps of graveyard clay had been 3
galvanised into morbid, unnatural, and brainless motion by various 3
modifications of the vital solution. 3
3
One thing had uttered a nerve-shattering scream; another had risen violently, 3
beaten us both to unconsciousness, and run amuck in a shocking way before it 3
could be placed behind asylum bars; still another, a loathsome African 3
monstrosity, had clawed out of its shallow grave and done a deed — West had 3
had to shoot that object. We could not get bodies fresh enough to shew any trace 3
of reason when reanimated, so had perforce created nameless horrors. It was 3
disturbing to think that one, perhaps two, of our monsters still lived — that 3
thought haunted us shadowingly, till finally West disappeared under frightful 3
circumstances. But at the time of the scream in the cellar laboratory of the 3
isolated Bolton cottage, our fears were subordinate to our anxiety for extremely 3
fresh specimens. West was more avid than I, so that it almost seemed to me that 3
he looked half-covetously at any very healthy living physique. 3
3
It was in July, 1910, that the bad luck regarding specimens began to turn. I had 3
been on a long visit to my parents in Illinois, and upon my return found West in 3
a state of singular elation. He had, he told me excitedly, in all likelihood solved 3
the problem of freshness through an approach from an entirely new angle — that 3
of artificial preservation. I had known that he was working on a new and highly 3
unusual embalming compound, and was not surprised that it had turned out 3
well; but until he explained the details I was rather puzzled as to how such a 3
3
3
3
187 3
3
3
3
compound could help in our work, since the objectionable staleness of the 3
specimens was largely due to delay occurring before we secured them. This, I 3
now saw. West had clearly recognised; creating his embalming compound for 3
future rather than immediate use, and trusting to fate to supply again some very 3
recent and unburied corpse, as it had years before when we obtained the negro 3
killed in the Bolton prize-fight. At last fate had been kind, so that on this occasion 3
there lay in the secret cellar laboratory a corpse whose decay could not by any 3
possibility have begun. What would happen on reanimation, and whether we 3
could hope for a revival of mind and reason. West did not venture to predict. The 3
experiment would be a landmark in our studies, and he had saved the new body 3
for my return, so that both might share the spectacle in accustomed fashion. 3
3
West told me how he had obtained the specimen. It had been a vigorous man; a 3
well-dressed stranger just off the train on his way to transact some business with 3
the Bolton Worsted Mills. The walk through the town had been long, and by the 3
time the traveller paused at our cottage to ask the way to the factories, his heart 3
had become greatly overtaxed. He had refused a stimulant, and had suddenly 3
dropped dead only a moment later. The body, as might be expected, seemed to 3
West a heaven-sent gift. In his brief conversation the stranger had made it clear 3
that he was unknown in Bolton, and a search of his pockets subsequently 3
revealed him to be one Robert Leavitt of St. Louis, apparently without a family to 3
make instant inquiries about his disappearance. If this man could not be restored 3
to life, no one would know of our experiment. We buried our materials in a 3
dense strip of woods between the house and the potter's field. If, on the other 3
hand, he could be restored, our fame would be brilliantly and perpetually 3
established. So without delay West had injected into the body's wrist the 3
compound which would hold it fresh for use after my arrival. The matter of the 3
presumably weak heart, which to my mind imperilled the success of our 3
experiment, did not appear to trouble West extensively. He hoped at last to 3
obtain what he had never obtained before — a rekindled spark of reason and 3
perhaps a normal, living creature. 3
3
So on the night of July 18, 1910, Herbert West and I stood in the cellar laboratory 3
and gazed at a white, silent figure beneath the dazzling arc-light. The embalming 3
compound had worked uncannily well, for as I stared fascinatedly at the sturdy 3
frame which had lain two weeks without stiffening, I was moved to seek West's 3
assurance that the thing was really dead. This assurance he gave readily enough; 3
reminding me that the reanimating solution was never used without careful tests 3
as to life, since it could have no effect if any of the original vitality were present. 3
As West proceeded to take preliminary steps, I was impressed by the vast 3
intricacy of the new experiment; an intricacy so vast that he could trust no hand 3
less delicate than his own. Forbidding me to touch the body, he first injected a 3
drug in the wrist just beside the place his needle had punctured when injecting 3
3
3
3
188 3
3
3
3
the embalming compound. This, he said, was to neutrahse the compound and 3
release the system to a normal relaxation so that the reanimating solution might 3
freely work when injected. Slightly later, when a change and a gentle tremor 3
seemed to affect the dead limbs; West stuffed a pillow-like object violently over 3
the twitching face, not withdrawing it until the corpse appeared quiet and ready 3
for our attempt at reanimation. The pale enthusiast now applied some last 3
perfunctory tests for absolute lifelessness, withdrew satisfied, and finally injected 3
into the left arm an accurately measured amount of the vital elixir, prepared 3
during the afternoon with a greater care than we had used since college days, 3
when our feats were new and groping. I cannot express the wild, breathless 3
suspense with which we waited for results on this first really fresh specimen — 3
the first we could reasonably expect to open its lips in rational speech, perhaps to 3
tell of what it had seen beyond the unfathomable abyss. 3
3
West was a materialist, believing in no soul and attributing all the working of 3
consciousness to bodily phenomena; consequently he looked for no revelation of 3
hideous secrets from gulfs and caverns beyond death's barrier. I did not wholly 3
disagree with him theoretically, yet held vague instinctive remnants of the 3
primitive faith of my forefathers; so that I could not help eyeing the corpse with a 3
certain amount of awe and terrible expectation. Besides — I could not extract 3
from my memory that hideous, inhuman shriek we heard on the night we tried 3
our first experiment in the deserted farmhouse at Arkham. 3
3
Very little time had elapsed before I saw the attempt was not to be a total failure. 3
A touch of colour came to cheeks hitherto chalk-white, and spread out under the 3
curiously ample stubble of sandy beard. West, who had his hand on the pulse of 3
the left wrist, suddenly nodded significantly; and almost simultaneously a mist 3
appeared on the mirror inclined above the body's mouth. There followed a few 3
spasmodic muscular motions, and then an audible breathing and visible motion 3
of the chest. I looked at the closed eyelids, and thought I detected a quivering. 3
Then the lids opened, shewing eyes which were grey, calm, and alive, but still 3
unintelligent and not even curious. 3
3
In a moment of fantastic whim I whispered questions to the reddening ears; 3
questions of other worlds of which the memory might still be present. 3
Subsequent terror drove them from my mind, but I think the last one, which I 3
repeated, was: "Where have you been?" I do not yet know whether I was 3
answered or not, for no sound came from the well-shaped mouth; but I do know 3
that at that moment I firmly thought the thin lips moved silently, forming 3
syllables which I would have vocalised as "only now" if that phrase had 3
possessed any sense or relevancy. At that moment, as I say, I was elated with the 3
conviction that the one great goal had been attained; and that for the first time a 3
reanimated corpse had uttered distinct words impelled by actual reason. In the 3
3
3
3
189 3
3
3
3
next moment there was no doubt about the triumph; no doubt that the solution 3
had truly accomplished, at least temporarily, its full mission of restoring rational 3
and articulate life to the dead. But in that triumph there came to me the greatest 3
of all horrors — not horror of the thing that spoke, but of the deed that I had 3
witnessed and of the man with whom my professional fortunes were joined. 3
3
For that very fresh body, at last writhing into full and terrifying consciousness 3
with eyes dilated at the memory of its last scene on earth, threw out its frantic 3
hands in a life and death struggle with the air, and suddenly collapsing into a 3
second and final dissolution from which there could be no return, screamed out 3
the cry that will ring eternally in my aching brain: 3
3
"Help! Keep off, you cursed little tow-head fiend — keep that damned needle 3
away from me!" 3

V. The Horror From the Shadows 3
3
Pubhshed June 1922 in Home Brew Vol. 1, No. 5, p. 45-50. 3
3
Many men have related hideous things, not mentioned in print, which happened 3
on the battlefields of the Great War. Some of these things have made me faint, 3
others have convulsed me with devastating nausea, while still others have made 3
me tremble and look behind me in the dark; yet despite the worst of them I 3
believe I can myself relate the most hideous thing of all — the shocking, the 3
unnatural, the unbelievable horror from the shadows. 3
3
In 1915 I was a physician with the rank of First Lieutenant in a Canadian 3
regiment in Flanders, one of many Americans to precede the government itself 3
into the gigantic struggle. I had not entered the army on my own initiative, but 3
rather as a natural result of the enlistment of the man whose indispensable 3
assistant I was — the celebrated Boston surgical specialist. Dr. Herbert West. Dr. 3
West had been avid for a chance to serve as surgeon in a great war, and when the 3
chance had come, he carried me with him almost against my will. There were 3
reasons why I could have been glad to let the war separate us; reasons why I 3
found the practice of medicine and the companionship of West more and more 3
irritating; but when he had gone to Ottawa and through a colleague's influence 3
secured a medical commission as Major, I could not resist the imperious 3
persuasion of one determined that I should accompany him in my usual 3
capacity. 3
3
When I say that Dr. West was avid to serve in battle, I do not mean to imply that 3
he was either naturally warlike or anxious for the safety of civilisation. Always 3
an ice-cold intellectual machine; slight, blond, blue-eyed, and spectacled; I think 3
3
3
3
190 3
3
3
3
he secretly sneered at my occasional martial enthusiasms and censures of supine 3
neutrality. There was, however, something he wanted in embattled Flanders; and 3
in order to secure it had had to assume a military exterior. What he wanted was 3
not a thing which many persons want, but something connected with the 3
peculiar branch of medical science which he had chosen quite clandestinely to 3
follow, and in which he had achieved amazing and occasionally hideous results. 3
It was, in fact, nothing more or less than an abundant supply of freshly killed 3
men in every stage of dismemberment. 3
3
Herbert West needed fresh bodies because his life-work was the reanimation of 3
the dead. This work was not known to the fashionable clientele who had so 3
swiftly built up his fame after his arrival in Boston; but was only too well known 3
to me, who had been his closest friend and sole assistant since the old days in 3
Miskatonic University Medical School at Arkham. It was in those college days 3
that he had begun his terrible experiments, first on small animals and then on 3
human bodies shockingly obtained. There was a solution which he injected into 3
the veins of dead things, and if they were fresh enough they responded in 3
strange ways. He had had much trouble in discovering the proper formula, for 3
each type of organism was found to need a stimulus especially adapted to it. 3
Terror stalked him when he reflected on his partial failures; nameless things 3
resulting from imperfect solutions or from bodies insufficiently fresh. A certain 3
number of these failures had remained alive — one was in an asylum while 3
others had vanished — and as he thought of conceivable yet virtually impossible 3
eventualities he often shivered beneath his usual stolidity. 3
3
West had soon learned that absolute freshness was the prime requisite for useful 3
specimens, and had accordingly resorted to frightful and unnatural expedients in 3
body-snatching. In college, and during our early practice together in the factory 3
town of Bolton, my attitude toward him had been largely one of fascinated 3
admiration; but as his boldness in methods grew, I began to develop a gnawing 3
fear. I did not like the way he looked at healthy living bodies; and then there 3
came a nightmarish session in the cellar laboratory when I learned that a certain 3
specimen had been a living body when he secured it. That was the first time he 3
had ever been able to revive the quality of rational thought in a corpse; and his 3
success, obtained at such a loathsome cost, had completely hardened him. 3
3
Of his methods in the intervening five years I dare not speak. I was held to him 3
by sheer force of fear, and witnessed sights that no human tongue could repeat. 3
Gradually I came to find Herbert West himself more horrible than anything he 3
did — that was when it dawned on me that his once normal scientific zeal for 3
prolonging life had subtly degenerated into a mere morbid and ghoulish 3
curiosity and secret sense of charnel picturesqueness. His interest became a 3
hellish and perverse addiction to the repellently and fiendishly abnormal; he 3
3
3
3
191 3
3
3
3
gloated calmly over artificial monstrosities which would make most healthy men 3
drop dead from fright and disgust; he became, behind his pallid intellectuality, a 3
fastidious Baudelaire of physical experiment — a languid Elagabalus of the 3
tombs. 3
3
Dangers he met unflinchingly; crimes he committed unmoved. I think the climax 3
came when he had proved his point that rational life can be restored, and had 3
sought new worlds to conquer by experimenting on the reanimation of detached 3
parts of bodies. He had wild and original ideas on the independent vital 3
properties of organic cells and nerve-tissue separated from natural physiological 3
systems; and achieved some hideous preliminary results in the form of never- 3
dying, artificially nourished tissue obtained from the nearly hatched eggs of an 3
indescribable tropical reptile. Two biological points he was exceedingly anxious 3
to settle — first, whether any amount of consciousness and rational action be 3
possible without the brain, proceeding from the spinal cord and various nerve- 3
centres; and second, whether any kind of ethereal, intangible relation distinct 3
from the material cells may exist to link the surgically separated parts of what 3
has previously been a single living organism. All this research work required a 3
prodigious supply of freshly slaughtered human flesh — and that was why 3
Herbert West had entered the Great War. 3
3
The phantasmal, unmentionable thing occurred one midnight late in March, 3
1915, in a field hospital behind the lines of St. Eloi. I wonder even now if it could 3
have been other than a daemoniac dream of delirium. West had a private 3
laboratory in an east room of the barn-like temporary edifice, assigned him on 3
his plea that he was devising new and radical methods for the treatment of 3
hitherto hopeless cases of maiming. There he worked like a butcher in the midst 3
of his gory wares — I could never get used to the levity with which he handled 3
and classified certain things. At times he actually did perform marvels of surgery 3
for the soldiers; but his chief delights were of a less public and philanthropic 3
kind, requiring many explanations of sounds which seemed peculiar even 3
amidst that babel of the damned. Among these sounds were frequent revolver- 3
shots — surely not uncommon on a battlefield, but distinctly uncommon in an 3
hospital. Dr. West's reanimated specimens were not meant for long existence or a 3
large audience. Besides human tissue. West employed much of the reptile 3
embryo tissue which he had cultivated with such singular results. It was better 3
than human material for maintaining life in organless fragments, and that was 3
now my friend's chief activity. In a dark corner of the laboratory, over a queer 3
incubating burner, he kept a large covered vat full of this reptilian cell-matter; 3
which multiplied and grew puffily and hideously. 3
3
On the night of which I speak we had a splendid new specimen — a man at once 3
physically powerful and of such high mentality that a sensitive nervous system 3
3
3
3
192 3
3
3
3
was assured. It was rather ironic, for he was the officer who had helped West to 3
his commission, and who was now to have been our associate. Moreover, he had 3
in the past secretly studied the theory of reanimation to some extent under West. 3
Major Sir Eric Moreland Clapham-Lee, D.S.O., was the greatest surgeon in our 3
division, and had been hastily assigned to the St. Eloi sector when news of the 3
heavy fighting reached headquarters. He had come in an aeroplane piloted by 3
the intrepid Lieut. Ronald Hill, only to be shot down when directly over his 3
destination. The fall had been spectacular and awful; Hill was unrecognisable 3
afterward, but the wreck yielded up the great surgeon in a nearly decapitated 3
but otherwise intact condition. West had greedily seized the lifeless thing which 3
had once been his friend and fellow-scholar; and I shuddered when he finished 3
severing the head, placed it in his hellish vat of pulpy reptile-tissue to preserve it 3
for future experiments, and proceeded to treat the decapitated body on the 3
operating table. He injected new blood, joined certain veins, arteries, and nerves 3
at the headless neck, and closed the ghastly aperture with engrafted skin from an 3
unidentified specimen which had borne an officer's uniform. I knew what he 3
wanted — to see if this highly organised body could exhibit, without its head, 3
any of the signs of mental life which had distinguished Sir Eric Moreland 3
Clapham-Lee. Once a student of reanimation, this silent trunk was now 3
gruesomely called upon to exemplify it. 3
3
I can still see Herbert West under the sinister electric light as he injected his 3
reanimating solution into the arm of the headless body. The scene I cannot 3
describe — I should faint if I tried it, for there is madness in a room full of 3
classified charnel things, with blood and lesser human debris almost ankle-deep 3
on the slimy floor, and with hideous reptilian abnormalities sprouting, bubbling, 3
and baking over a winking bluish-green spectre of dim flame in a far corner of 3
black shadows. 3
3
The specimen, as West repeatedly observed, had a splendid nervous system. 3
Much was expected of it; and as a few twitching motions began to appear, I 3
could see the feverish interest on West's face. He was ready, I think, to see proof 3
of his increasingly strong opinion that consciousness, reason, and personality can 3
exist independently of the brain — that man has no central connective spirit, but 3
is merely a machine of nervous matter, each section more or less complete in 3
itself. In one triumphant demonstration West was about to relegate the mystery 3
of life to the category of myth. The body now twitched more vigorously, and 3
beneath our avid eyes commenced to heave in a frightful way. The arms stirred 3
disquietingly, the legs drew up, and various muscles contracted in a repulsive 3
kind of writhing. Then the headless thing threw out its arms in a gesture which 3
was unmistakably one of desperation — an intelligent desperation apparently 3
sufficient to prove every theory of Herbert West. Certainly, the nerves were 3
recalling the man's last act in life; the struggle to get free of the falling aeroplane. 3
3
3
3
193 3
3
3
3
What followed, I shall never positively know. It may have been wholly an 3
hallucination from the shock caused at that instant by the sudden and complete 3
destruction of the building in a cataclysm of German shell-fire — who can 3
gainsay it, since West and I were the only proved survivors? West liked to think 3
that before his recent disappearance, but there were times when he could not; for 3
it was queer that we both had the same hallucination. The hideous occurrence 3
itself was very simple, notable only for what it implied. 3
3
The body on the table had risen with a blind and terrible groping, and we had 3
heard a sound. I should not call that sound a voice, for it was too awful. And yet 3
its timbre was not the most awful thing about it. Neither was its message — it 3
had merely screamed, "Jump, Ronald, for God's sake, jump!" The awful thing 3
was its source. 3
3
For it had come from the large covered vat in that ghoulish corner of crawling 3
black shadows. 3

VI. The Tomb-Legions 3
3
Pubhshed July 1922 in Home Brew Vol. 1, No. 6, p. 57-62. 3
3
When Dr. Herbert West disappeared a year ago, the Boston police questioned me 3
closely. They suspected that I was holding something back, and perhaps 3
suspected graver things; but I could not tell them the truth because they would 3
not have believed it. They knew, indeed, that West had been connected with 3
activities beyond the credence of ordinary men; for his hideous experiments in 3
the reanimation of dead bodies had long been too extensive to admit of perfect 3
secrecy; but the final soul-shattering catastrophe held elements of daemoniac 3
phantasy which make even me doubt the reality of what I saw. 3
3
I was West's closest friend and only confidential assistant. We had met years 3
before, in medical school, and from the first I had shared his terrible researches. 3
He had slowly tried to perfect a solution which, injected into the veins of the 3
newly deceased, would restore life; a labour demanding an abundance of fresh 3
corpses and therefore involving the most unnatural actions. Still more shocking 3
were the products of some of the experiments — grisly masses of flesh that had 3
been dead, but that West waked to a blind, brainless, nauseous ammation. These 3
were the usual results, for in order to reawaken the mind it was necessary to 3
have specimens so absolutely fresh that no decay could possibly affect the 3
delicate brain- cells. 3
3
This need for very fresh corpses had been West's moral undoing. They were hard 3
to get, and one awful day he had secured his specimen while it was still alive and 3
3
3
3
194 3
3
3
3
vigorous. A struggle, a needle, and a powerful alkaloid had transformed it to a 3
very fresh corpse, and the experiment had succeeded for a brief and memorable 3
moment; but West had emerged with a soul calloused and seared, and a 3
hardened eye which sometimes glanced with a kind of hideous and calculating 3
appraisal at men of especially sensitive brain and especially vigorous physique. 3
Toward the last I became acutely afraid of West, for he began to look at me that 3
way. People did not seem to notice his glances, but they noticed my fear; and 3
after his disappearance used that as a basis for some absurd suspicions. 3
3
West, in reality, was more afraid than I; for his abominable pursuits entailed a 3
life of furtiveness and dread of every shadow. Partly it was the police he feared; 3
but sometimes his nervousness was deeper and more nebulous, touching on 3
certain indescribable things into which he had injected a morbid life, and from 3
which he had not seen that life depart. He usually finished his experiments with 3
a revolver, but a few times he had not been quick enough. There was that first 3
specimen on whose rifled grave marks of clawing were later seen. There was also 3
that Arkham professor's body which had done cannibal things before it had been 3
captured and thrust unidentified into a madhouse cell at Sefton, where it beat the 3
walls for sixteen years. Most of the other possibly surviving results were things 3
less easy to speak of — for in later years West's scientific zeal had degenerated to 3
an unhealthy and fantastic mania, and he had spent his chief skill in vitalising 3
not entire human bodies but isolated parts of bodies, or parts joined to organic 3
matter other than human. It had become fiendishly disgusting by the time he 3
disappeared; many of the experiments could not even be hinted at in print. The 3
Great War, through which both of us served as surgeons, had intensified this 3
side of West. 3
3
In saying that West's fear of his specimens was nebulous, I have in mind 3
particularly its complex nature. Part of it came merely from knowing of the 3
existence of such nameless monsters, while another part arose from 3
apprehension of the bodily harm they might under certain circumstances do him. 3
Their disappearance added horror to the situation — of them all. West knew the 3
whereabouts of only one, the pitiful asylum thing. Then there was a more subtle 3
fear — a very fantastic sensation resulting from a curious experiment in the 3
Canadian army in 1915. West, in the midst of a severe battle, had reanimated 3
Major Sir Eric Moreland Clapham-Lee, D.S.O., a fellow-physician who knew 3
about his experiments and could have duplicated them. The head had been 3
removed, so that the possibilities of quasi-intelligent life in the trunk might be 3
investigated. Just as the building was wiped out by a German shell, there had 3
been a success. The trunk had moved intelligently; and, unbelievable to relate, 3
we were both sickeningly sure that articulate sounds had come from the 3
detached head as it lay in a shadowy corner of the laboratory. The shell had been 3
merciful, in a way — but West could never feel as certain as he wished, that we 3

3
two were the only survivors. He used to make shuddering conjectures about the 3
possible actions of a headless physician with the power of reanimating the dead. 3
3
West's last quarters were in a venerable house of much elegance, overlooking 3
one of the oldest burying- grounds in Boston. He had chosen the place for purely 3
symbolic and fantastically aesthetic reasons, since most of the interments were of 3
the colonial period and therefore of little use to a scientist seeking very fresh 3
bodies. The laboratory was in a sub-cellar secretly constructed by imported 3
workmen, and contained a huge incinerator for the quiet and complete disposal 3
of such bodies, or fragments and synthetic mockeries of bodies, as might remain 3
from the morbid experiments and unhallowed amusements of the owner. During 3
the excavation of this cellar the workmen had struck some exceedingly ancient 3
masonry; undoubtedly connected with the old burying-ground, yet far too deep 3
to correspond with any known sepulchre therein. After a number of calculations 3
West decided that it represented some secret chamber beneath the tomb of the 3
Averills, where the last interment had been made in 1768. I was with him when 3
he studied the nitrous, dripping walls laid bare by the spades and mattocks of 3
the men, and was prepared for the gruesome thrill which would attend the 3
uncovering of centuried grave-secrets; but for the first time West's new timidity 3
conquered his natural curiosity, and he betrayed his degenerating fibre by 3
ordering the masonry left intact and plastered over. Thus it remained till that 3
final hellish night; part of the walls of the secret laboratory. I speak of West's 3
decadence, but must add that it was a purely mental and intangible thing. 3
Outwardly he was the same to the last — calm, cold, slight, and yellow-haired, 3
with spectacled blue eyes and a general aspect of youth which years and fears 3
seemed never to change. He seemed calm even when he thought of that clawed 3
grave and looked over his shoulder; even when he thought of the carnivorous 3
thing that gnawed and pawed at Sefton bars. 3
3
The end of Herbert West began one evening in our joint study when he was 3
dividing his curious glance between the newspaper and me. A strange headline 3
item had struck at him from the crumpled pages, and a nameless titan claw had 3
seemed to reach down through sixteen years. Something fearsome and incredible 3
had happened at Sefton Asylum fifty miles away, stunning the neighbourhood 3
and baffling the police. In the small hours of the morning a body of silent men 3
had entered the grounds, and their leader had aroused the attendants. He was a 3
menacing military figure who talked without moving his lips and whose voice 3
seemed almost ventriloquially connected with an immense black case he carried. 3
His expressionless face was handsome to the point of radiant beauty, but had 3
shocked the superintendent when the hall light fell on it — for it was a wax face 3
with eyes of painted glass. Some nameless accident had befallen this man. A 3
larger man guided his steps; a repellent hulk whose bluish face seemed half 3
eaten away by some unknown malady. The speaker had asked for the custody of 3
3
3
3
196 3
3
3
3
the cannibal monster committed from Arkham sixteen years before; and upon 3
being refused, gave a signal which precipitated a shocking riot. The fiends had 3
beaten, trampled, and bitten every attendant who did not flee; killing four and 3
finally succeeding in the liberation of the monster. Those victims who could 3
recall the event without hysteria swore that the creatures had acted less like men 3
than like unthinkable automata guided by the wax-faced leader. By the time help 3
could be summoned, every trace of the men and of their mad charge had 3
vanished. 3
3
From the hour of reading this item until midmght. West sat almost paralysed. At 3
midnight the doorbell rang, startling him fearfully. All the servants were asleep 3
in the attic, so I answered the bell. As I have told the police, there was no wagon 3
in the street, but only a group of strange-looking figures bearing a large square 3
box which they deposited in the hallway after one of them had grunted in a 3
highly unnatural voice, "Express — prepaid." They filed out of the house with a 3
jerky tread, and as I watched them go I had an odd idea that they were turning 3
toward the ancient cemetery on which the back of the house abutted. When I 3
slammed the door after them West came downstairs and looked at the box. It 3
was about two feet square, and bore West's correct name and present address. It 3
also bore the inscription, "From Eric Moreland Clapham-Lee, St. Eloi, Flanders." 3
Six years before, in Flanders, a shelled hospital had fallen upon the headless 3
reanimated trunk of Dr. Clapham-Lee, and upon the detached head which — 3
perhaps — had uttered articulate sounds. 3
3
West was not even excited now. His condition was more ghastly. Quickly he 3
said, "It's the finish — but let's incinerate — this." We carried the thing down to 3
the laboratory — listening. I do not remember many particulars — you can 3
imagine my state of mind — but it is a vicious lie to say it was Herbert West's 3
body which I put into the incinerator. We both inserted the whole unopened 3
wooden box, closed the door, and started the electricity. Nor did any sound come 3
from the box, after all. 3
3
It was West who first noticed the falling plaster on that part of the wall where the 3
ancient tomb masonry had been covered up. I was going to run, but he stopped 3
me. Then I saw a small black aperture, felt a ghoulish wind of ice, and smelled 3
the charnel bowels of a putrescent earth. There was no sound, but just then the 3
electric lights went out and I saw outlined against some phosphorescence of the 3
nether world a horde of silent toiling things which only insanity — or worse — 3
could create. Their outlines were human, semi-human, fractionally human, and 3
not human at all — the horde was grotesquely heterogeneous. They were 3
removing the stones quietly, one by one, from the centuried wall. And then, as 3
the breach became large enough, they came out into the laboratory in single file; 3
led by a talking thing with a beautiful head made of wax. A sort of mad-eyed 3
3
3
3
197 3
3
3
3
monstrosity behind the leader seized on Herbert West. West did not resist or 3
utter a sound. Then they all sprang at him and tore him to pieces before my eyes, 3
bearing the fragments away into that subterranean vault of fabulous 3
abominations. West's head was carried off by the wax-headed leader, who wore 3
a Canadian officer's uniform. As it disappeared I saw that the blue eyes behind 3
the spectacles were hideously blazing with their first touch of frantic, visible 3
emotion. 3
3
Servants found me unconscious in the morning. West was gone. The incinerator 3
contained only unidentifiable ashes. Detectives have questioned me, but what 3
can I say? The Sefton tragedy they will not connect with West; not that, nor the 3
men with the box, whose existence they deny. I told them of the vault, and they 3
pointed to the unbroken plaster wall and laughed. So I told them no more. They 3
imply that I am either a madman or a murderer — probably I am mad. But I 3
might not be mad if those accursed tomb- legions had not been so silent. 3

Apropos of sleep, that sinister adventure of all our nights, we may say that men 3
go to bed daily with an audacity that would be incomprehensible if we did not 3
know that it is the result of ignorance of the danger. 3
3
- Baudelaire 3
3
May the merciful gods, if indeed there be such, guard those hours when no 3
power of the will, or drug that the cunning of man devises, can keep me from the 3
chasm of sleep. Death is merciful, for there is no return therefrom, but with him 3
who has come back out of the nethermost chambers of night, haggard and 3
knowing, peace rests nevermore. Fool that I was to plunge with such 3
unsanctioned phrensy into mysteries no man was meant to penetrate; fool or god 3
that he was - my only friend, who led me and went before me, and who in the 3
end passed into terrors which may yet be mine! 3
3
We met, I recall, in a railway station, where he was the center of a crowd of the 3
vulgarly curious. He was unconscious, having fallen in a kind of convulsion 3
which imparted to his slight black-clad body a strange rigidity. I think he was 3
then approaching forty years of age, for there were deep lines in the face, wan 3
and hollow-cheeked, but oval and actually beautiful; and touches of gray in the 3
thick, waving hair and small full beard which had once been of the deepest raven 3
black. His brow was white as the marble of Pentelicus, and of a height and 3
breadth almost god-like. 3
3
I said to myself, with all the ardor of a sculptor, that this man was a faun's statue 3
out of antique Hellas, dug from a temple's ruins and brought somehow to life in 3
our stifling age only to feel the chill and pressure of devastating years. And when 3
he opened his immense, sunken, and wildly luminous black eyes I knew he 3
would be thenceforth my only friend - the only friend of one who had never 3
possessed a friend before - for I saw that such eyes must have looked fully upon 3
the grandeur and the terror of realms beyond normal consciousness and reality; 3
realms which I had cherished in fancy, but vainly sought. So as I drove the 3
crowd away I told him he must come home with me and be my teacher and 3
leader in unfathomed mysteries, and he assented without speaking a word. 3
Afterward I found that his voice was music - the music of deep viols and of 3
crystalline spheres. We talked often in the night, and in the day, when I chiseled 3
3
3
3

3
3
busts of him and carved miniature heads in ivory to immortahze his different 3
expressions. 3
3
Of our studies it is impossible to speak, since they held so slight a connection 3
with anything of the world as living men conceive it. They were of that vaster 3
and more appalling universe of dim entity and consciousness which lies deeper 3
than matter, time, and space, and whose existence we suspect only in certain 3
forms of sleep - those rare dreams beyond dreams which come never to common 3
men, and but once or twice in the lifetime of imaginative men. The cosmos of our 3
waking knowledge, born from such an universe as a bubble is born from the pipe 3
of a jester, touches it only as such a bubble may touch its sardonic source when 3
sucked back by the jester's whim. Men of learning suspect it little and ignore it 3
mostly. Wise men have interpreted dreams, and the gods have laughed. One 3
man with Oriental eyes has said that all time and space are relative, and men 3
have laughed. But even that man with Oriental eyes has done no more than 3
suspect. I had wished and tried to do more than suspect, and my friend had tried 3
and partly succeeded. Then we both tried together, and with exotic drugs 3
courted terrible and forbidden dreams in the tower studio chamber of the old 3
manor-house in hoary Kent. 3
3
Among the agonies of these after days is that chief of torments - inarticulateness. 3
What I learned and saw in those hours of impious exploration can never be told - 3
for want of symbols or suggestions in any language. I say this because from first 3
to last our discoveries partook only of the nature of sensations; sensations 3
correlated with no impression which the nervous system of normal humanity is 3
capable of receiving. They were sensations, yet within them lay unbelievable 3
elements of time and space - things which at bottom possess no distinct and 3
definite existence. Human utterance can best convey the general character of our 3
experiences by calling them plungings or soarings; for in every period of 3
revelation some part of our minds broke boldly away from all that is real and 3
present, rushing aerially along shocking, unlighted, and fear-haunted abysses, 3
and occasionally tearing through certain well-marked and typical obstacles 3
describable only as viscous, uncouth clouds of vapors. 3
3
In these black and bodiless flights we were sometimes alone and sometimes 3
together. When we were together, my friend was always far ahead; I could 3
comprehend his presence despite the absence of form by a species of pictorial 3
memory whereby his face appeared to me, golden from a strange light and 3
frightful with its weird beauty, its anomalously youthful cheeks, its burning 3
eyes, its Olympian brow, and its shadowing hair and growth of beard. 3
3
Of the progress of time we kept no record, for time had become to us the merest 3
illusion. I know only that there must have been something very singular 3
3
3
3
200 3
3
3
3
involved, since we came at length to marvel why we did not grow old. Our 3
discourse was unholy, and always hideously ambitious - no god or daemon 3
could have aspired to discoveries and conquest like those which we planned in 3
whispers. I shiver as I speak of them, and dare not be explicit; though I will say 3
that my friend once wrote on paper a wish which he dared not utter with his 3
tongue, and which made me burn the paper and look affrightedly out of the 3
window at the spangled night sky. I will hint - only hint - that he had designs 3
which involved the rulership of the visible universe and more; designs whereby 3
the earth and the stars would move at his command, and the destinies of all 3
living things be his. I affirm - I swear - that I had no share in these extreme 3
aspirations. Anything my friend may have said or written to the contrary must 3
be erroneous, for I am no man of strength to risk the unmentionable spheres by 3
which alone one might achieve success. 3
3
There was a night when winds from unknown spaces whirled us irresistibly into 3
limitless vacua beyond all thought and entity. Perceptions of the most 3
maddeningly untransmissible sort thronged upon us; perceptions of infinity 3
which at the time convulsed us with joy, yet which are now partly lost to my 3
memory and partly incapable of presentation to others. Viscous obstacles were 3
clawed through in rapid succession, and at length I felt that we had been borne 3
to realms of greater remoteness than any we had previously known. 3
3
My friend was vastly in advance as we plunged into this awesome ocean of 3
virgin aether, and I could see the sinister exultation on his floating, luminous, 3
too-youthful memory-face. Suddenly that face became dim and quickly 3
disappeared, and in a brief space I found myself projected against an obstacle 3
which I could not penetrate. It was like the others, yet incalculably denser; a 3
sticky clammy mass, if such terms can be applied to analogous qualities in a non- 3
material sphere. 3
3
I had, I felt, been halted by a barrier which my friend and leader had successfully 3
passed. Struggling anew, I came to the end of the drug-dream and opened my 3
physical eyes to the tower studio in whose opposite corner reclined the pallid 3
and still unconscious form of my fellow dreamer, weirdly haggard and wildly 3
beautiful as the moon shed gold-green light on his marble features. 3
3
Then, after a short interval, the form in the corner stirred; and may pitying 3
heaven keep from my sight and sound another thing like that which took place 3
before me. I cannot tell you how he shrieked, or what vistas of unvisitable hells 3
gleamed for a second in black eyes crazed with fright. I can only say that I 3
fainted, and did not stir till he himself recovered and shook me in his phrensy for 3
someone to keep away the horror and desolation. 3
3
3
3
201 3
3
3
3
That was the end of our voluntary searchings in the caverns of dream. Awed, 3
shaken, and portentous, my friend who had been beyond the barrier warned me 3
that we must never venture within those realms again. What he had seen, he 3
dared not tell me; but he said from his wisdom that we must sleep as little as 3
possible, even if drugs were necessary to keep us awake. That he was right, I 3
soon learned from the unutterable fear which engulfed me whenever 3
consciousness lapsed. 3
3
After each short and inevitable sleep I seemed older, whilst my friend aged with 3
a rapidity almost shocking. It is hideous to see wrinkles form and hair whiten 3
almost before one's eyes. Our mode of life was now totally altered. Heretofore a 3
recluse so far as I know - his true name and origin never having passed his lips - 3
my friend now became frantic in his fear of solitude. At night he would not be 3
alone, nor would the company of a few persons calm him. His sole relief was 3
obtained in revelry of the most general and boisterous sort; so that few 3
assemblies of the young and gay were unknown to us. 3
3
Our appearance and age seemed to excite in most cases a ridicule which I keenly 3
resented, but which my friend considered a lesser evil than solitude. Especially 3
was he afraid to be out of doors alone when the stars were shining, and if forced 3
to this condition he would often glance furtively at the sky as if hunted by some 3
monstrous thing therein. He did not always glance at the same place in the sky - 3
it seemed to be a different place at different times. On spring evenings it would 3
be low in the northeast. In the summer it would be nearly overhead. In the 3
autumn it would be in the northwest. In winter it would be in the east, but 3
mostly if in the small hours of morning. 3
3
Midwinter evenings seemed least dreadful to him. Only after two years did I 3
connect this fear with anything in particular; but then I began to see that he must 3
be looking at a special spot on the celestial vault whose position at different 3
times corresponded to the direction of his glance - a spot roughly marked by the 3
constellation Corona Borealis. 3
3
We now had a studio in London, never separating, but never discussing the days 3
when we had sought to plumb the mysteries of the unreal world. We were aged 3
and weak from our drugs, dissipations, and nervous overstrain, and the thinning 3
hair and beard of my friend had become snow-white. Our freedom from long 3
sleep was surprising, for seldom did we succumb more than an hour or two at a 3
time to the shadow which had now grown so frightful a menace. 3
3
Then came one January of fog and rain, when money ran low and drugs were 3
hard to buy. My statues and ivory heads were all sold, and I had no means to 3
purchase new materials, or energy to fashion them even had I possessed them. 3
3
3
3
202 3
3
3
3
We suffered terribly, and on a certain night my friend sank into a deep-breathing 3
sleep from which I could not awaken him. I can recall the scene now - the 3
desolate, pitch-black garret studio under the eaves with the rain beating down; 3
the ticking of our lone clock; the fancied ticking of our watches as they rested on 3
the dressing-table; the creaking of some swaying shutter in a remote part of the 3
house; certain distant city noises muffled by fog and space; and, worst of all, the 3
deep, steady, sinister breathing of my friend on the couch - a rhythmical 3
breathing which seemed to measure moments of supernal fear and agony for his 3
spirit as it wandered in spheres forbidden, unimagined, and hideously remote. 3
3
The tension of my vigil became oppressive, and a wild train of trivial 3
impressions and associations thronged through my almost unhinged mind. I 3
heard a clock strike somewhere - not ours, for that was not a striking clock - and 3
my morbid fancy found in this a new starting-point for idle wanderings. Clocks - 3
time - space - infinity - and then my fancy reverted to the locale as I reflected that 3
even now, beyond the roof and the fog and the rain and the atmosphere. Corona 3
Borealis was rising in the northeast. Corona Borealis, which my friend had 3
appeared to dread, and whose scintillant semicircle of stars must even now be 3
glowing unseen through the measureless abysses of aether. All at once my 3
feverishly sensitive ears seemed to detect a new and wholly distinct component 3
in the soft medley of drug-magnified sounds - a low and damnably insistent 3
whine from very far away; droning, clamoring, mocking, calling, from the 3
northeast. 3
3
But it was not that distant whine which robbed me of my faculties and set upon 3
my soul such a seal of fright as may never in life be removed; not that which 3
drew the shrieks and excited the convulsions which caused lodgers and police to 3
break down the door. It was not what I heard, but what I saw; for in that dark, 3
locked, shuttered, and curtained room there appeared from the black northeast 3
corner a shaft of horrible red-gold light - a shaft which bore with it no glow to 3
disperse the darkness, but which streamed only upon the recumbent head of the 3
troubled sleeper, bringing out in hideous duplication the luminous and strangely 3
youthful memory-face as I had known it in dreams of abysmal space and 3
unshackled time, when my friend had pushed behind the barrier to those secret, 3
innermost and forbidden caverns of nightmare. 3
3
And as I looked, I beheld the head rise, the black, liquid, and deep-sunken eyes 3
open in terror, and the thin, shadowed lips part as if for a scream too frightful to 3
be uttered. There dwelt in that ghastly and flexible face, as it shone bodiless, 3
luminous, and rejuvenated in the blackness, more of stark, teeming, brain- 3
shattering fear than all the rest of heaven and earth has ever revealed to me. 3
3
3
3
203 3
3
3
3
No word was spoken amidst the distant sound that grew nearer and nearer, but 3
as I followed the memory- face's mad stare along that cursed shaft of light to its 3
source, the source whence also the whining came, I, too, saw for an instant what 3
it saw, and fell with ringing ears in that fit of shrieking epilepsy which brought 3
the lodgers and the police. Never could I tell, try as I might, what it actually was 3
that I saw; nor could the still face tell, for although it must have seen more than I 3
did, it will never speak again. But always I shall guard against the mocking and 3
insatiate Hypnos, lord of sleep, against the night sky, and against the mad 3
ambitions of knowledge and philosophy. 3
3
Just what happened is unknown, for not only was my own mind unseated by the 3
strange and hideous thing, but others were tainted with a forgetfulness which 3
can mean nothing if not madness. They have said, I know not for what reason, 3
that I never had a friend; but that art, philosophy, and insanity had filled all my 3
tragic life. The lodgers and police on that night soothed me, and the doctor 3
administered something to quiet me, nor did anyone see what a nightmare event 3
had taken place. My stricken friend moved them to no pity, but what they found 3
on the couch in the studio made them give me a praise which sickened me, and 3
now a fame which I spurn in despair as I sit for hours, bald, gray-bearded, 3
shriveled, palsied, drug-crazed, and broken, adoring and praying to the object 3
they found. 3
3
For they deny that I sold the last of my statuary, and point with ecstasy at the 3
thing which the shining shaft of light left cold, petrified, and unvocal. It is all that 3
remains of my friend; the friend who led me on to madness and wreckage; a 3
godlike head of such marble as only old Hellas could yield, young with the 3
youth that is outside time, and with beauteous bearded face, curved, smiling lips, 3
Olympian brow, and dense locks waving and poppy-crowned. They say that that 3
haunting memory-face is modeled from my own, as it was at twenty-five; but 3
upon the marble base is carven a single name in the letters of Attica - HYPNOS. 3

Ibid 3
3
" . . .as Ibid says in his famous Lives of the Poets." 3
3
- From a student theme. 3
3
The erroneous idea that Ibid is the author of the Lives is so frequently met with, 3
even among those pretending to a degree of cuhure, that it is worth correcting. It 3
should be a matter of general knowledge that Cf. is responsible for this work. 3
Ibid's masterpiece, on the other hand, was the famous Op. Cit. wherein all the 3
significant undercurrents of Graeco-Roman expression were crystallised once for 3
all - and with admirable acuteness, notwithstanding the surprisingly late date at 3
which Ibid wrote. There is a false report - very commonly reproduced in modern 3
books prior to Von Schweinkopf's monumental Geschichte der Ostrogothen in 3
Italien - that Ibid was a Romanised Visigoth of Ataulf's horde who settled in 3
Placentia about 410 A. D. The contrary cannot be too strongly emphasised; for 3
Von Schweinkopf, and since his time Littlewitl and Betenoir,2 have shewn with 3
irrefutable force that this strikingly isolated figure was a genuine Roman - or at 3
least as genuine a Roman as that degenerate and mongrelised age could produce 3
3
- of whom one might well say what Gibbon said of Boethius, "that he was the 3
last whom Cato or Tully could have acknowledged for their countryman." He 3
was, like Boethius and nearly all the eminent men of his age, of the great Anician 3
family, and traced his genealogy with much exactitude and self-satisfaction to all 3
the heroes of the republic. His full name - long and pompous according to the 3
custom of an age which had lost the trinomial simplicity of classic Roman 3
nomenclature - is stated by Von Schweinkopf3 to have been Caius Anicius 3
Magnus Furius Camillus Aemilianus Cornelius Valerius Pompeius Julius Ibidus; 3
though Littlewit4 rejects Aemilianus and adds Claudius Deciusfunianus; whilst 3
BetenoirS differs radically, giving the full name as Magnus Furius Camillus 3
Aurelius Antoninus Flavins Anicius Petronius Valentinianus Aegidus Ibidus. 3
3
The eminent critic and biographer was born in the year 486, shortly after the 3
extinction of the Roman rule in Gaul by Clovis. Rome and Ravenna are rivals for 3
the honour of his birth, though it is certain that he received his rhetorical and 3
philosophical training in the schools of Athens - the extent of whose suppression 3
by Theodosius a century before is grossly exaggerated by the superficial. In 512, 3
under the benign rule of the Ostrogoth Theodoric, we behold him as a teacher of 3
rhetoric at Rome, and in 516 he held the consulship together with Pompilius 3
Numantius Bombastes Marcellinus Deodamnatus. Upon the death of Theodoric 3
in 526, Ibidus retired from public life to compose his celebrated work (whose 3
pure Ciceronian style is as remarkable a case of classic atavism as is the verse of 3
Claudius Claudianus, who flourished a century before Ibidus); but he was later 3
3
3
3
205 3
3
3
3
recalled to scenes of pomp to act as court rhetorician for Theodatus, nephew of 3
Theodoric. 3
3
Upon the usurpation of Vitiges, Ibidus fell into disgrace and was for a time 3
imprisoned; but the coming of the Byzantine-Roman army under Belisarius soon 3
restored him to liberty and honours. Throughout the siege of Rome he served 3
bravely in the army of the defenders, and afterward followed the eagles of 3
Belisarius to Alba, Porto, and Centumcellae. After the Prankish siege of Milan, 3
Ibidus was chosen to accompany the learned Bishop Datius to Greece, and 3
resided with him at Corinth in the year 539. About 541 he removed to 3
Constantinopolis, where he received every mark of imperial favour both from 3
Justinianus and Justinus the Second. The Pmperors Tiberius and Maurice did 3
kindly honour to his old age, and contributed much to his immortality - 3
especially Maurice, whose delight it was to trace his ancestry to old Rome 3
notwithstanding his birth at Arabiscus, in Cappadocia. It was Maurice who, in 3
the poet's 101st year, secured the adoption of his work as a textbook in the 3
schools of the empire, an honour which proved a fatal tax on the aged 3
rhetorician's emotions, since he passed away peacefully at his home near the 3
church of St. Sophia on the sixth day before the Kalends of September, A. D. 587, 3
in the 102nd year of his age. 3
3
His remains, notwithstanding the troubled state of Italy, were taken to Ravenna 3
for interment; but being interred in the suburb of Classe, were exhumed and 3
ridiculed by the Lombard Duke of Spoleto, who took his skull to King Autharis 3
for use as a wassail-bowl. Ibid's skull was proudly handed down from king to 3
king of the Lombard line. Upon the capture of Pavia by Charlemagne in 774, the 3
skull was seized from the tottering Desiderius and carried in the train of the 3
Prankish conqueror. It was from this vessel, indeed, that Pope Leo administered 3
the royal unction which made of the hero-nomad a Holy Roman Pmperor. 3
Charlemagne took Ibid's skull to his capital at Aix, soon after- ward presenting it 3
to his Saxon teacher Alcuin, upon whose death in 804 it was sent to Alcuin's 3
kinsfolk in Pngland. 3
3
William the Conqueror, finding it in an abbey niche where the pious family of 3
Alcuin had placed it (believing it to be the skull of a saint6 who had miraculously 3
annihilated the Lombards by his prayers), did reverence to its osseous antiquity; 3
and even the rough soldiers of Cromwell, upon destroying Ballylough Abbey in 3
Ireland in 1650 (it having been secretly transported thither by a devout Papist in 3
1539, upon Henry VII's dissolution of the English monasteries), declined to offer 3
violence to a relic so venerable. 3
3
It was captured by the private soldier Read-'em-and-Weep Hopkins, who not 3
long after traded it to Rest- in-Jehovah Stubbs for a quid of new Virginia weed. 3

3
Stubbs, upon sending forth his son Zerubbabel to seek his fortune in New 3
England in 1661 (for he thought ill of the Restoration atmosphere for a pious 3
young yeoman), gave him St. Ibid's - or rather Brother Ibid's, for he abhorred all 3
that was Popish - skull as a talisman. Upon landing in Salem Zerubbabel set it up 3
in his cupboard beside the chimney, he having built a modest house near the 3
town pump. However, he had not been wholly unaffected by the Restoration 3
influence; and having become addicted to gaming, lost the skull to one Epenetus 3
Dexter, a visiting freeman of Providence. 3
3
It was in the house of Dexter, in the northern part of the town near the present 3
intersection of North Main and Olney Streets, on the occasion of Canonchet's 3
raid of March 30, 1676, during King Philip's War; and the astute sachem, 3
recognising it at once as a thing of singular venerableness and dignity, sent it as a 3
symbol of alliance to a faction of the Pequots in Connecticut with whom he was 3
negotiating. On April 4 he was captured by the colonists and soon after executed, 3
but the austere head of Ibid continued on its wanderings. 3
3
The Pequots, enfeebled by a previous war, could give the now stricken 3
Narragansetts no assistance; and in 1680 a Dutch furtrader of Albany, Petrus van 3
Schaack, secured the distinguished cranium for the modest sum of two guilders, 3
he having recognised its value from the half-effaced inscription carved in 3
Lombardic minuscules (palaeography, it might be explained, was one of the 3
leading accomplishments of New-Netherland fur-traders of the seventeenth 3
century). 3
3
From van Schaack, sad to say, the relic was stolen in 1683 by a French trader, 3
Jean Grenier, whose Popish zeal recognised the features of one whom he had 3
been taught at his mother's knee to revere as St. Ibide. Grenier, fired with 3
virtuous rage at the possession of this holy symbol by a Protestant, crushed van 3
Schaack's head one night with an axe and escaped to the north with his booty; 3
soon, however, being robbed and slain by the half-breed voyageur Michel 3
Savard, who took the skull - despite the illiteracy which prevented his 3
recognising it - to add to a collection of similar but more recent material. 3
3
Upon his death in 1701 his half-breed son Pierre traded it among other things to 3
some emissaries of the Sacs and Foxes, and it was found outside the chief's tepee 3
a generation later by Charles de Langlade, founder of the trading post at Green 3
Bay, Wisconsin. De Langlade regarded this sacred object with proper veneration 3
and ransomed it at the expense of many glass beads; yet after his time it found 3
itself in many other hands, being traded to settlements at the head of Lake 3
Winnebago, to tribes around Lake Mendota, and finally, early in the nineteenth 3
century, to one Solomon Juneau, a Frenchman, at the new trading post of 3
Milwaukee on the Menominee River and the shore of Lake Michigan. 3
3
3
3
207 3
3
3
3
Later traded to Jacques Caboche, another settler, it was in 1850 lost in a game of 3
chess or poker to a newcomer named Hans Zimmerman; being used by him as a 3
beer-stein until one day, under the spell of its contents, he suffered it to roll from 3
his front stoop to the prairie path before his home - where, falling into the 3
burrow of a prairie-dog, it passed beyond his power of discovery or recovery 3
upon his awaking. 3
3
So for generations did the sainted skull of Caius Anicius Magnus Furius 3
Camillus Aemilianus Cornelius Valerius Pompeius Julius Ibidus, consul of 3
Rome, favourite of emperors, and saint of the Romish church, lie hidden beneath 3
the soil of a growing town. At first worshipped with dark rites by the prairie- 3
dogs, who saw in it a deity sent from the upper world, it afterward fell into dire 3
neglect as the race of simple, artless burrowers succumbed before the onslaught 3
of the conquering Aryan. Sewers came, but they passed by it. Houses went up - 3
2303 of them, and more - and at last one fateful night a titan thing occurred. 3
Subtle Nature, convulsed with a spiritual ecstasy, like the froth of that region's 3
quondam beverage, laid low the lofty and heaved high the humble - and behold! 3
In the roseal dawn the burghers of Milwaukee rose to find a former prairie 3
turned to a highland! Vast and far-reaching was the great upheaval. Subterrene 3
arcana, hidden for years, came at last to the light. For there, full in the rifted 3
roadway, lay bleached and tranquil in bland, saintly, and consular pomp the 3
dome-like skull of Ibid! 3

Mystery attracts mystery. Ever since the wide appearance of my name as a 3
performer of unexplained feats, I have encountered strange narratives and events 3
which my calling has led people to link with my interests and activities. Some of 3
these have been trivial and irrelevant, some deeply dramatic and absorbing, 3
some productive of weird and perilous experiences and some involving me in 3
extensive scientific and historical research. Many of these matters I have told and 3
shall continue to tell very freely; but there is one of which I speak with great 3
reluctance, and which I am now relating only after a session of grilling 3
persuasion from the publishers of this magazine, who had heard vague rumors 3
of it from other members of my family. 3
3
The hitherto guarded subject pertains to my non-professional visit to Egypt 3
fourteen years ago, and has been avoided by me for several reasons. For one 3
thing, I am averse to exploiting certain unmistakably actual facts and conditions 3
obviously unknown to the myriad tourists who throng about the pyramids and 3
apparently secreted with much diligence by the authorities at Cairo, who cannot 3
be wholly ignorant of them. For another thing, I dislike to recount an incident in 3
which my own fantastic imagination must have played so great a part. What I 3
saw - or thought I saw - certainly did not take place; but is rather to be viewed as 3
a result of my then recent readings in Egyptology, and of the speculations anent 3
this theme which my environment naturally prompted. These imaginative 3
stimuli, magnified by the excitement of an actual event terrible enough in itself, 3
undoubtedly gave rise to the culminating horror of that grotesque night so long 3
past. 3
3
In January, 1910, I had finished a professional engagement in England and 3
signed a contract for a tour of Australian theatres. A liberal time being allowed 3
for the trip, I determined to make the most of it in the sort of travel which chiefly 3
interests me; so accompanied by my wife I drifted pleasantly down the Continent 3
and embarked at Marseilles on the P & O Steamer Malwa, bound for Port Said. 3
From that point I proposed to visit the principal historical localities of lower 3
Egypt before leaving finally for Australia. 3
3
The voyage was an agreeable one, and enlivened by many of the amusing 3
incidents which befall a magical performer apart from his work. I had intended, 3
for the sake of quiet travel, to keep my name a secret; but was goaded into 3
3
3
3
209 3
3
3
3
betraying myself by a fellow-magician whose anxiety to astound the passengers 3
with ordinary tricks tempted me to duplicate and exceed his feats in a manner 3
quite destructive of my incognito. I mention this because of its ultimate effect - an 3
effect I should have foreseen before unmasking to a shipload of tourists about to 3
scatter throughout the Nile valley. What it did was to herald my identity 3
wherever I subsequently went, and deprive my wife and me of all the placid 3
inconspicuousness we had sought. Traveling to seek curiosities, I was often 3
forced to stand inspection as a sort of curiosity myself! 3
3
We had come to Egypt in search of the picturesque and the mystically 3
impressive, but found little enough when the ship edged up to Port Said and 3
discharged its passengers in small boats. Low dunes of sand, bobbing buoys in 3
shallow water, and a drearily European small town with nothing of interest save 3
the great De Lesseps statue, made us anxious to get to something more worth 3
our while. After some discussion we decided to proceed at once to Cairo and the 3
Pyramids, later going to Alexandria for the Australian boat and for whatever 3
Greco-Roman sights that ancient metropolis might present. 3
3
The railway journey was tolerable enough, and con sumed only four hours and a 3
half. We saw much of the Suez Canal, whose route we followed as far as 3
Ismailiya and later had a taste of Old Egypt in our glimpse of the restored fresh- 3
water canal of the Middle Empire. Then at last we saw Cairo glimmering 3
through the growing dusk; a winkling constellation which became a blaze as we 3
halted at the great Care Centrale. 3
3
But once more disappointment awaited us, for all that we beheld was European 3
save the costumes and the crowds. A prosaic subway led to a square teeming 3
with carriages, taxicabs, and trolley-cars and gorgeous with electric lights 3
shining on tall buildings; whilst the very theatre where I was vainly requested to 3
play and which I later attended as a spectator, had recently been renamed the 3
'American Cosmograph'. We stopped at Shepheard's Hotel, reached in a taxi that 3
sped along broad, smartly built-up streets; and amidst the perfect service of its 3
restaurant, elevators and generally Anglo-American luxuries the mysterious East 3
and immemorial past seemed very far away. 3
3
The next day, however, precipitated us delightfully into the heart of the Arabian 3
Nights atmosphere; and in the winding ways and exotic skyline of Cairo, the 3
Bagdad of Harun-al-Rashid seemed to live again. Guided by our Baedeker, we 3
had struck east past the Ezbekiyeh Gardens along the Mouski in quest of the 3
native quarter, and were soon in the hands of a clamorous cicerone who - 3
notwith standing later developments - was assuredly a master at his trade. 3
3
3
3
210 3
3
3
3
Not until afterward did I see that I should have applied at the hotel for a licensed 3
guide. This man, a shaven, peculiarly hollow-voiced and relatively cleanly fellow 3
who looked like a Pharaoh and called himself 'Abdul Reis el Drogman' appeared 3
to have much power over others of his kind; though subsequently the police 3
professed not to know him, and to suggest that reis is merely a name for any 3
person in authority, whilst 'Drogman' is obviously no more than a clumsy 3
modification of the word for a leader of tourist parties - dragoman. 3
3
Abdul led us among such wonders as we had before only read and dreamed of. 3
Old Cairo is itself a story-book and a dream - labyrinths of narrow alleys 3
redolent of aromatic secrets; Arabesque balconies and oriels nearly meeting 3
above the cobbled streets; maelstroms of Oriental traffic with strange cries, 3
cracking whips, rattling carts, jingling money, and braying donkeys; 3
kaleidoscopes of polychrome robes, veils, turbans, and tarbushes; water-carriers 3
and dervishes, dogs and cats, soothsayers and barbers; and over all the whining 3
of blind beggars crouched in alcoves, and the sonorous chanting of muezzins 3
from minarets limned delicately against a sky of deep, unchanging blue. 3
3
The roofed, quieter bazaars were hardly less alluring. Spice, perfume, incense 3
beads, rugs, silks, and brass - old Mahmoud Suleiman squats cross-legged 3
amidst his gummy bottles while chattering youths pulverize mustard in the 3
hoUowed-out capital of an ancient classic column - a Roman Corinthian, perhaps 3
from neighboring Heliopolis, where Augustus stationed one of his three 3
Egyptian legions. Antiquity begins to mingle with exoticism. And then the 3
mosques and the museum - we saw them all, and tried not to let our Arabian 3
revel succumb to the darker charm of Pharaonic Egypt which the museum's 3
priceless treasures offered. That was to be our climax, and for the present we 3
concentrated on the mediaeval Saracenic glories of the Califs whose magnificent 3
tomb-mosques form a glittering faery necropolis on the edge of the Arabian 3
Desert. 3
3
At length Abdul took us along the Sharia Mohammed Ali to the ancient mosque 3
of Sultan Hassan, and the tower-flanked Babel-Azab, beyond which climbs the 3
steep-walled pass to the mighty citadel that Saladin himself built with the stones 3
of forgotten pyramids. It was sunset when we scaled that cliff, circled the 3
modern mosque of Mohammed Ali, and looked down from the dizzy parapet 3
over mystic Cairo - mystic Cairo all golden with its carven domes, its ethereal 3
minarets and its flaming gardens. 3
3
Far over the city towered the great Roman dome of the new museum; and 3
beyond it - across the cryptic yellow Nile that is the mother of eons and dynasties 3
- lurked the menacing sands of the Libyan Desert, undulant and iridesc ent and 3
evil with older arcana. 3
3
3
3
211 3
3
3
3
The red sun sank low, bringing the relentless chill of Egyptian dusk; and as it 3
stood poised on the world's rim like that ancient god of Heliopolis - Re- 3
Harakhte, the Horizon-Sun - we saw silhouetted against its vermeil holocaust the 3
black outlines of the Pyramids of Gizeh - the palaeogean tombs there were hoary 3
with a thousand years when Tut-Ankh-Amen mounted his golden throne in 3
distant Thebes. Then we knew that we were done with Saracen Cairo, and that 3
we must taste the deeper mysteries of primal Egypt - the black Kem of Re and 3
Amen, Isis and Osiris. 3
3
The next morning we visited the Pyramids, riding out in a Victoria across the 3
island of Chizereh with its massive lebbakh trees, and the smaller English bridge 3
to the western shore. Down the shore road we drove, between great rows of 3
lebbakhs and past the vast Zoological Gardens to the suburb of Gizeh, where a 3
new bridge to Cairo proper has since been built. Then, turning inland along the 3
Sharia-el-Haram, we crossed a region of glassy canals and shabby native villages 3
till before us loomed the objects of our quest, cleaving the mists of dawn and 3
forming inverted replicas in the roadside pools. Forty centuries, as Napoleon had 3
told his campaigners there, indeed looked down upon us. 3
3
The road now rose abruptly, till we finally reached our place of transfer between 3
the trolley station and the Mena House Hotel. Abdul Reis, who capably 3
purchased our Pyramid tickets, seemed to have an understanding with the 3
crowding, yelling and offensive Bedouins who inhabited a squalid mud village 3
some distance away and pestiferously assailed every traveler; for he kept them 3
very decently at bay and secured an excellent pair of camels for us, himself 3
mounting a donkey and assigning the leadership of our animals to a group of 3
men and boys more expensive than useful. The area to be traversed was so small 3
that camels were hardly needed, but we did not regret adding to our experience 3
this troublesome form of desert navigation. 3
3
The pyramids stand on a high rock plateau, this group forming next to the 3
northernmost of the series of regal and aristocratic cemeteries built in the 3
neighborhood of the extinct capital Memphis, which lay on the same side of the 3
Nile, somewhat south of Gizeh, and which flourished between 3400 and 2000 3
B.C. The greatest pyramid, which lies nearest the modern road, was built by King 3
Cheops or Khufu about 2800 B.C., and stands more than 450 feet in 3
perpendicular height. In a line southwest from this are successively the Second 3
Pyramid, built a generation later by King Khephren, and though slightly smaller, 3
looking even larger because set on higher ground, and the radically smaller 3
Third Pyramid of King Mycerinus, built about 2700 B.C. Near the edge of the 3
plateau and due east of the Second Pyramid, with a face probably altered to form 3
a colossal portrait of Khephren, its royal restorer, stands the monstrous Sphinx - 3
mute, sardonic, and wise beyond mankind and memory. 3
3
3
3
212 3
3
3
3
Minor pyramids and the traces of ruined minor pyramids are found in several 3
places, and the whole plateau is pitted with the tombs of dignitaries of less than 3
royal rank. These latter were originally marked by mastabas, or stone bench- like 3
structures about the deep burial shafts, as found in other Memphian cemeteries 3
and exemplified by Perneb's Tomb in the Metropolitan Museum of New York. 3
At Gizeb, however, all such visible things have been swept away by time and 3
pillage; and only the rock-hewn shafts, either sand-filled or cleared out by 3
archaeologists, remain to attest their former existence. Connected with each tomb 3
was a chapel in which priests and relatives offered food and prayer to the 3
hovering ka or vital principle of the deceased. The small tombs have their 3
chapels contained in their stone mastabas or superstructures, but the mortuary 3
chapels of the pyramids, where regal Pharaohs lay, were separate temples, each 3
to the east of its corresponding pyramid, and connec ted by a causeway to a 3
massive gate-chapel or propylon at the edge of the rock plateau. 3
3
The gate-chapel leading to the Second Pyramid, nearly buried in the drifting 3
sands, yawns subterraneously south-east of the Sphinx. Persistent tradition dubs 3
it the 'Temple of the Sphinx'; and it may perhaps be rightly called such if the 3
Sphinx indeed represents the Second Pyramid's builder Khephren. There are 3
unpleasant tales of the Sphinx before Khephren - but whatever its elder features 3
were, the monarch replaced them with his own that men might look at the 3
colossus without fear. 3
3
It was in the great gateway-temple that the life-size diorite statue of Khephren 3
now in the Cairo museum was found; a statue before which I stood in awe when 3
I beheld it. Whether the whole edifice is now excavated I am not certain, but in 3
1910 most of it was below ground, with the entrance heavily barred at night. 3
Germans were in charge of the work, and the war or other things may have 3
stopped them. I would give much, in view of my experience and of certain 3
Bedouin whisperings discredited or unknown in Cairo, to know what has 3
developed in connection with a certain well in a transverse gallery where statues 3
of the Pharaoh were found in curious juxtaposition to the statues of baboons. 3
3
The road, as we traversed it on our camels that morning, curved sharply past the 3
wooden police quarters, post office, drug store and shops on the left, and 3
plunged south and east in a complete bend that scaled the rock plateau and 3
brought us face to face with the desert under the lee of the Great Pyramid. Past 3
Cyclopean masonry we rode, rounding the eastern face and looking down ahead 3
into a valley of minor pyramids beyond which the eternal Nile glistened to the 3
east, and the eternal desert shimmered to the west. Very close loomed the three 3
major pyramids, the greatest devoid of outer casing and showing its bulk of 3
great stones, but the others retaining here and there the neatly fitted covering 3
which had made them smooth and finished in their day. 3
3
3
3
213 3
3
3
3
Presently we descended toward the Sphinx, and sat silent beneath the spell of 3
those terrible unseeing eyes. On the vast stone breast we faintly discerned the 3
emblem of Re-Harakhte, for whose image the Sphinx was mistaken in a late 3
dynasty; and though sand covered the tablet between the great paws, we recalled 3
what Thutmosis IV inscribed thereon, and the dream he had when a prince. It 3
was then that the smile of the Sphinx vaguely displeased us, and made us 3
wonder about the legends of subterranean pas sages beneath the monstrous 3
creature, leading down, down, to depths none might dare hint at - depths 3
connected with mysteries older than the dynastic Egypt we excavate, and having 3
a sinister relation to the persistence of abnormal, animal-headed gods in the 3
ancient Nilotic pantheon. Then, too, it was I asked myself in idle question whose 3
hideous significance was not to appear for many an hour. 3
3
Other tourists now began to overtake us, and we moved on to the sand-choked 3
Temple of the Sphinx, fifty yards to the southeast, which I have previously 3
mentioned as the great gate of the causeway to the Second Pyramid's mortuary 3
chapel on the plateau. Most of it was still underground, and although we 3
dismounted and descended through a modern passageway to its alabaster 3
corridor and pillared hall, I felt that Adul and the local German attendant had 3
not shown us all there was to see. 3
3
After this we made the conventional circuit of the pyramid plateau, examining 3
the Second Pyramid and the peculiar ruins of its mortuary chapel to the east, the 3
Third Pyramid and its miniature southern satellites and ruined eastern chapel, 3
the rock tombs and the honeycombings of the Fourth and Fifth dynasties, and the 3
famous Campbell's Tomb whose shadowy shaft sinks precipitously for fifty- 3
three feet to a sinister sarcophagus which one of our camel drivers divested of 3
the cumbering sand after a vertiginous descent by rope. 3
3
Cries now assailed us from the Great Pyramid, where Bedouins were besieging a 3
party of tourists with offers of speed in the performance of solitary trips up and 3
down. Seven minutes is said to be the record for such an ascent and descent, but 3
many lusty sheiks and sons of sheiks assured us they could cut it to five if given 3
the requisite impetus of liberal baksheesh. They did not get this impetus, though 3
we did let Abdul take us up, thus obtaining a view of unprecedented 3
magnificence which included not only remote and glittering Cairo with its 3
crowned citadel back ground of gold-violet hills, but all the pyramids of the 3
Memphian district as well, from Abu Roash on the north to the Dashur on the 3
south. The Sakkara step-pyramid, which marks the evolution of the low mastaba 3
into the true pyramid, showed clearly and alluringly in the sandy distance. It is 3
close to this transition-monument that the famed :omb of Perneb was found - 3
more than four hundred miles orth of the Theban rock valley where Tut-Ankh- 3
Amen sleeps. Again I was forced to silence through sheer awe. The prospect of 3
3
3
3
214 3
3
3
3
such antiquity, and the secrets each hoary monument seemed to hold and brood 3
over, filled me with a reverence and sense of immensity nothing else ever gave 3
me. 3
3
Fatigued by our climb, and disgusted with the importunate Bedouins whose 3
actions seemed to defy every rule of taste, we omitted the arduous detail of 3
entering the cramped interior passages of any of the pyramids, though we saw 3
several of the hardiest tourists preparing for the suffocating crawl through 3
Cheops' mightiest memorial. As we dismissed and overpaid our local bodyguard 3
and drove back to Cairo with Abdul Reis under the afternoon sun, we half 3
regretted the omission we had made. Such fascinating things were whispered 3
about lower pyramid pas sages not in the guide books; passages whose entrances 3
had been hastily blocked up and concealed by certain uncommunicative 3
archaeologists who had found and begun to explore them. 3
3
Of course, this whispering was largely baseless on the face of it; but it was 3
curious to reflect how persistently visitors were forbidden to enter the Pyramids 3
at night, or to visit the lowest burrows and crypt of the Great Pyramid. Perhaps 3
in the latter case it was the psychological effect which was feared - the effect on 3
the visitor of feeling himself huddled down beneath a gigantic world of solid 3
masonry; joined to the life he has known by the merest tube, in which he may 3
only crawl, and which any accident or evil design might block. The whole subject 3
seemed so weird and alluring that we resolved to pay the pyramid plateau 3
another visit at the earliest possible opportun ity. For me this opportunity came 3
much earlier than I expected. 3
3
That evening, the members of our party feeling some what tired after the 3
strenuous program of the day, I went alone with Abdul Reis for a walk through 3
the picturesque Arab quarter. Though I had seen it by day, I wished to study the 3
alleys and bazaars in the dusk, when rich shadows and mellow gleams of light 3
would add to their glamor and fantastic illusion. The native crowds were 3
thinning, but were still very noisy and numerous when we came upon a knot of 3
reveling Bedouins in the Suken-Nahhasin, or bazaar of the coppersmiths. Their 3
apparent leader, an insolent youth with heavy features and saucily cocked 3
tarbush, took some notice of us, and evidently recognized with no great 3
friendliness my competent but admittedly supercilious and sneeringly disposed 3
guide. 3
3
Perhaps, I thought, he resented that odd reproduction of the Sphinx's half-smile 3
which I had often remarked with amused irritation; or perhaps he did not like 3
the hollow and sepulchral resonance of Abdul's voice. At any rate, the exchange 3
of ancestrally opprobrious language became very brisk; and before long Ali Ziz, 3
as I heard the stranger called when called by no worse name, began to pull 3
3
3
3
215 3
3
3
3
violently at Abdul's robe, an action quickly reciprocated and leading to a spirited 3
scuffle in which both combatants lost their sacredly cherished headgear and 3
would have reached an even direr condition had I not intervened and separated 3
them by main force. 3
3
My interference, at first seemingly unwelcome on both sides, succeeded at last in 3
effecting a truce. Sullenly each belligerent composed his wrath and his attire, and 3
with an assumption of dignity as profound as it was sudden, the two formed a 3
curious pact of honor which I soon learned is a custom of great antiquity in Cairo 3
- a pact for the settle ment of their difference by means of a nocturnal fist fight 3
atop the Great Pyramid, long after the departure of the last moon light sightseer. 3
Each duelist was to assemble a party of seconds, and the affair was to begin at 3
midnight, proceeding by rounds in the most civilized possible fashion. 3
3
In all this planning there was much which excited my interest. The fight itself 3
promised to be unique and spectacular, while the thought of the scene on that 3
hoary pile overlooking the antediluvian plateau of Gizeh under the wan moon of 3
the pallid small hours appealed to every fiber of imagination in me. A request 3
found Abdul exceedingly willing to admit me to his party of seconds; so that all 3
the rest of the early evening I accompanied him to various dens in the most 3
lawless regions of the town - mostly northeast of the Ezbekiyeh - where he 3
gathered one by one a select and formidable band of congenial cutthroats as his 3
pugilistic background. 3
3
Shortly after nine our party, mounted on donkeys bearing such royal or tourist- 3
reminiscent names as 'Rameses,' 'Mark Twain,' 'J. P. Morgan,' and 'Minnehaha', 3
edged through street labyrinths both Oriental and Occidental, crossed the 3
muddy and mast-forested Nile by the bridge of the bronze lions, and cantered 3
philosophically between the lebbakhs on the road to Gizeh. Slightly over two 3
hours were consumed by the trip, toward the end of which we passed the last of 3
the returning tourists, saluted the last inbound trolley-car, and were alone with 3
the night and the past and the spectral moon. 3
3
Then we saw the vast pyramids at the end of the avenue, ghoulish with a dim 3
atavistical menace which I had not seemed to notice in the daytime. Even the 3
smallest of them held a hint of the ghastly -for was it not in this that they had 3
buried Queen Nitocris alive in the Sixth Dynasty; subtle Queen Nitocris, who 3
once invited all her enemies to a feast in a temple below the Nile, and drowned 3
them by opening the water-gates? I recalled that the Arabs whisper things about 3
Nitocris, and shun the Third Pyramid at certain phases of the moon. It must have 3
been over her that Thomas Moore was brooding when he wrote a thing muttered 3
about by Memphian boatmen: 3
3
3
3
216 3
3
3
3
'The subterranean nymph that dwells 3
3
'Mid sunless gems and glories hid 3
3
The lady of the Pyramid!' 3
3
Early as we were, Ali Ziz and his party were ahead of us; for we saw their 3
donkeys outlined against the desert plateau at Kafrel-Haram; toward which 3
squalid Arab settlement, close to the Sphinx, we had diverged instead of 3
following the regular road to the Mena House, where some of the sleepy, 3
inefficient police might have observed and halted us. Here, where filthy 3
Bedouins stabled camels and donkeys in the rock tombs of Khephren's courtiers, 3
we were led up the rocks and over the sand to the Great Pyramid, up whose 3
time-worn sides the Arabs swarmed eagerly, Abdul Reis offering me the 3
assistance I did not need. 3
3
As most travelers know, the actual apex of this structure has long been worn 3
away, leaving a reasonably flat platform twelve yards square. On this eery 3
pinnacle a squared circle was formed, and in a few moments the sardonic desert 3
moon leered down upon a battle which, but for the quality of the ringside cries, 3
might well have occurred at some minor athletic club in America. As I watched 3
it, I felt that some of our less -desirable institutions were not lacking; for every 3
blow, feint, and defense bespoke 'stalling' to my not inexperienced eye. It was 3
quickly over, and despite my misgivings as to methods I felt a sort of proprietary 3
pride when Abdul Reis was adjudged the winner. 3
3
Reconciliation was phenomenally rapid, and amidst the singing, fraternizing and 3
drinking that followed, I found it difficult to realize that a quarrel had ever 3
occurred. Oddly enough, I myself seemed to be more a center of notice than the 3
antagonists; and from my smattering of Arabic I judged that they were 3
discussing my professional performances and escapes from every sort of manacle 3
and confinement, in a manner which indicated not only a surprising knowledge 3
of me, but a distinct hostility and skepticism concerning my feats of escape. It 3
gradually dawned on me that the elder magic of Egypt did not depart without 3
leaving traces, and that fragments of a strange secret lore and priestly cult 3
practises have survived surreptitiously amongst the fella heen to such an extent 3
that the prowess of a strange hahwi or magician is resented and disputed. I 3
thought of how much my hollow-voiced guide Abdul Reis looked like an old 3
Egyptian priest or Pharaoh or smiling Sphinx . . . and wondered. 3
3
Suddenly something happened which in a flash proved the correctness of my 3
reflections and made me curse the denseness whereby I had accepted this night's 3
events as other than the empty and malicious 'frame-up' they now showed 3
themselves to be. Without warning, and doubtless in answer to some subtle sign 3
from Abdul, the entire band of Bedouins precipitated itself upon me; and having 3
3
3
3
217 3
3
3
3
produced heavy ropes, soon had me bound as securely as I was ever bound in 3
the course of my Hfe, either on the stage or off. 3
3
I struggled at first, but soon saw that one man could make no headway against a 3
band of over twenty sinewy barbarians. My hands were tied behind my back, my 3
knees bent to their fullest extent, and my wrists and ankles stoutly linked 3
together with unyielding cords. A stifling gag was forced into my mouth, and a 3
blindfold fastened tightly over my eyes. Then, as Arabs bore me aloft on their 3
shoulders and began a jouncing descent of the pyramid, I heard the taunts of my 3
late guide Abdul, who mocked and jeered delightedly in his hollow voice, and 3
assured me that I was soon to have my 'magic -powers' put to a supreme test - 3
which would quickly remove any egotism I might have gained through 3
triumphing over all the tests offered by America and Europe. Egypt, he 3
reminded me, is very old, and full of inner mysteries and antique powers not 3
even conceivable to the experts of today, whose devices had so uniformly failed 3
to entrap me. 3
3
How far or in what direction I was carried, I cannot tell; for the circumstances 3
were all against the formation of any accurate judgment. I know, however, that it 3
could not have been a great distance; since my bearers at no point hastened 3
beyond a walk, yet kept me aloft a surprisingly short time. It is this perplexing 3
brevity which makes me feel almost like shuddering whenever I think of Gizeh 3
and its plateau - for one is oppressed by hints of the closeness to everyday tourist 3
routes of what existed then and must exist still. 3
3
The evil abnormality I speak of did not become manifest at first. Setting me 3
down on a surface which I recognized as sand rather than rock, my captors 3
passed a rope around my chest and dragged me a few feet to a ragged opening in 3
the ground, into which they presently lowered me with much rough handling. 3
For apparent eons I bumped against the stony irregular sides of a narrow hewn 3
well which I took to be one of the numerous burial-shafts of the plateau until the 3
prodigious, almost incredible depth of it robbed me of all bases of conjecture. 3
3
The horror of the experience deepened with every dragging second. That any 3
descent through the sheer solid rock could be so vast without reaching the core 3
of the planet itself, or that any rope made by man could be so long as to dangle 3
me in these unholy and seemingly fathomless pro fundities of nether earth, were 3
beliefs of such grotesqueness that it was easier to doubt my agitated senses than 3
to accept them. Even now I am uncertain, for I know how deceitful the sense of 3
time becomes when one is removed or distorted. But I am quite sure that I 3
preserved a logical consciousness that far; that at least I did not add any 3
fullgrown phantoms of imagination to a picture hideous enough in its reality, 3
and explicable by a type of cerebral illusion vastly short of actual hallucination. 3
3
3
3
218 3
3
3
3
All this was not the cause of my first bit of fainting. The shocking ordeal was 3
cumulative, and the beginning of the later terrors was a very perceptible increase 3
in my rate of descent. They were paying out that infinitely long rope very swiftly 3
now, and I scraped cruelly against the rough and constricted sides of the shaft as 3
I shot madly downward. My clothing was in tatters, and I felt the trickle of blood 3
all over, even above the mounting and excruciating pain. My nostrils, too, were 3
assailed by a scarcely definable menace: a creeping odor of damp and staleness 3
curiously unlike anything I had ever smelled before, and having faint overtones 3
of spice and incense that lent an element of mockery. 3
3
Then the mental cataclysm came. It was horrible - hideous beyond all articulate 3
description because it was all of the soul, with nothing of detail to describe. It 3
was the ecstasy of nightmare and the summation of the fiendish. The suddenness 3
of it was apocalyptic and demoniac - one moment I was plunging agonizingly 3
down that narrow well of million-toothed torture, yet the next moment I was 3
soaring on bat-wings in the gulfs of hell; swinging free and swooping through 3
illimitable miles of boundless, musty space; rising dizzily to measureless 3
pinnacles of chilling ether, then diving gaspingly to sucking nadirs of ravenous, 3
nauseous lower vacua ... Thank God for the mercy that shut out in oblivion 3
those clawing Furies of consciousness which half unhinged my faculties, and tore 3
harpy-like at my spirit! That one respite, short as it was, gave me the strength 3
and sanity to endure those still greater sublima tions of cosmic panic that lurked 3
and gibbered on the road ahead. 3
3
II 3
3
It was very gradually that I regained my senses after that eldritch flight through 3
Stygian space. The process was infinitely painful, and colored by fantastic 3
dreams in which my bound and gagged condition found singular embodiment. 3
The precise nature of these dreams was very clear while I was experiencing 3
them, but became blurred in my recollection almost immediately afterward, and 3
was soon reduced to the merest outline by the terrible events - real or imaginary - 3
which followed. I dreamed that I was in the grasp of a great and horrible paw; a 3
yellow, hairy, five- clawed paw which had reached out of the earth to crush and 3
engulf me. And when I stopped to reflect what the paw was, it seemed to me that 3
it was Egypt. In the dream I looked back at the events of the preceding weeks, 3
and saw myself lured and enmeshed little by little, subtly and insidiously, by 3
some hellish ghoul-spirit of the elder Nile sorcery; some spirit that was in Egypt 3
before ever man was, and that will be when man is no more. 3
3
I saw the horror and unwholesome antiquity of Egypt, and the grisly alliance it 3
has always had with the tombs and temples of the dead. I saw phantom 3
processions of priests with the heads of bulls, falcons, cats, and ibises; phantom 3
processions marching interminably through subterraneous labyrinths and 3
3
3
3
219 3
3
3
3
avenues of titanic propylaea beside which a man is as a fly, and offering 3
unnamable sacrifice to indescribable gods. Stone colossi marched in endless 3
night and drove herds of grinning androsphinxes down to the shores of 3
illimitable stagnant rivers of pitch. And behind it all I saw the ineffable malignity 3
of primordial necromancy, black and amorphous, and fumbling greedily after 3
me in the darkness to choke out the spirit that had dared to mock it by 3
emulation. 3
3
In my sleeping brain there took shape a melodrama of sinister hatred and 3
pursuit, and I saw the black soul of Egypt singling me out and calling me in 3
inaudible whispers; calling and luring me, leading me on with the glitter and 3
glamor of a Saracenic surface, but ever pulling me down to the age-mad 3
catacombs and horrors of its dead and abysmal pharaonic heart. 3
3
Then the dream faces took on human resemblances, and I saw my guide Abdul 3
Reis in the robes of a king, with the sneer of the Sphinx on his features. And I 3
knew that those features were the features of Khephren the Great, who raised the 3
Second Pyramid, carved over the Sphinx's face in the likeness of his own and 3
built that titanic gateway temple whose myriad corridors the archaeologists 3
think they have dug out of the cryptical sand and the uninformative rock. And I 3
looked at the long, lean rigid hand of Khephren; the long, lean, rigid hand as I 3
had seen it on the diorite statue in the Cairo Museum - the statue they had found 3
in the terrible gateway temple - and wondered that I had not shrieked when I 3
saw it on Abdul Reis... That hand! It was hideously cold, and it was crushing 3
me; it was the cold and cramping of the sarcophagus . . . the chill and constriction 3
of unrememberable Egypt... It was nighted, necropolitan Egypt itself.., that 3
yellow paw. .. and they whisper such things of Khephren. . . 3
3
But at this juncture I began to wake - or at least, to assume a condition less 3
completely that of sleep than the one just preceding. I recalled the fight atop the 3
pyramid, the treacherous Bedouins and their attack, my frightful descent by rope 3
through endless rock depths, and my mad swinging and plunging in a chill void 3
redolent of aromatic putrescence. I perceived that I now lay on a damp rock 3
floor, and that my bonds were still biting into me with unloosened force. It was 3
very cold, and I seemed to detect a faint current of noisome air sweeping across 3
me. The cuts and bruises I had received from the jagged sides of the rock shaft 3
were paining me woefully, their soreness enhanced to a stinging or burning 3
acuteness by some pungent quality in the faint draft, and the mere act of rolling 3
over was enough to set my whole frame throbbing with untold agony. 3
3
As I turned I felt a tug from above, and concluded that the rope whereby I was 3
lowered still reached to the surface. Whether or not the Arabs still held it, I had 3
no idea; nor had I any idea how far within the earth I was. I knew that the 3
3
3
3
220 3
3
3
3
darkness around me was wholly or nearly total, since no ray of moonlight 3
penetrated my blindfold; but I did not trust my senses enough to accept as 3
evidence of extreme depth the sensation of vast duration which had 3
characterized my descent. 3
3
Knowing at least that I was in a space of considerable extent reached from the 3
above surface directly by an opening in the rock, I doubtfully conjectured that 3
my prison was perhaps the buried gateway chapel of old Khephren - the Temple 3
of the Sphinx - perhaps some inner corridors which the guides had not shown 3
me during my morning visit, and from which I might easily escape if I could find 3
my way to the barred entrance. It would be a labyrinthine wandering, but no 3
worse than others out of which I had in the past found my way. 3
3
The first step was to get free of my bonds, gag, and blindfold; and this I knew 3
would be no great task, since subtler experts than these Arabs had tried every 3
known species of fetter upon me during my long and varied career as an 3
exponent of escape, yet had never succeeded in defeating my methods. 3
3
Then it occurred to me that the Arabs might be ready to meet and attack me at 3
the entrance upon any evidence of my probable escape from the binding cords, 3
as would be furnished by any decided agitation of the rope which they probably 3
held. This, of course, was taking for granted that my place of confinement was 3
indeed Khephren's Temple of the Sphinx. The direct opening in the roof, 3
wherever it might lurk, could not be beyond easy reach of the ordinary modern 3
entrance near the Sphinx; if in truth it were any great distance at all on the 3
surface, since the total area known to visitors is not at all enormous. I had not 3
noticed any such opening during my daytime pilgrimage, but knew that these 3
things are easily overlooked amidst the drifting sands. 3
3
Thinking these matters over as I lay bent and bound on the rock floor, I nearly 3
forgot the horrors of abysmal descent and cavernous swinging which had so 3
lately reduced me to a coma. My present thought was only to outwit the Arabs, 3
and I accordingly determined to work myself free as quickly as possible, 3
avoiding any tug on the descending line which might betray an effective or even 3
problematical attempt at freedom. 3
3
This, however, was more easily determined than effected. A few preliminary 3
trials made it clear that little could be accomplished without considerable 3
motion; and it did not surprise me when, after one especially energetic struggle, I 3
began to feel the coils of falling rope as they piled up about me and upon me. 3
Obviously, I thought, the Bedouins had felt my movements and released their 3
end of the rope; hastening no doubt to the temple's true entrance to lie 3
murderously in wait for me. 3
3
3
3
221 3
3
3
3
The prospect was not pleasing - but I had faced worse in my time without 3
flinching, and would not flinch now. At present I must first of all free myself of 3
bonds, then trust to ingenuity to escape from the temple unharmed. It is curious 3
how implicitly I had come to believe myself in the old temple of Khephren beside 3
the Sphinx, only a short dis tance below the ground. 3
3
That belief was shattered, and every pristine apprehen sion of preternattiral 3
depth and demoniac mystery revived, by a circumstance which grew in horror 3
and significance even as I formulated my philosophical plan. I have said that the 3
falling rope was piling up about and upon me. Now I saw that it was continuing 3
to pile, as no rope of normal length could possibly do. It gained in momentum 3
and became an avalanche of hemp, accumulating moun tainously on the floor 3
and half burying me beneath its swiftly multiplying coils. Soon I was completely 3
engulfed and gasping for breath as the increasing convolutions submerged and 3
stifled me. 3
3
My senses tottered again, and I vaguely tried to fight off a menace desperate and 3
ineluctable. It was not merely that I was tortured beyond human endurance - not 3
merely that life and breath seemed to be crushed slowly out of me - it was the 3
knowledge of what those unnatural lengths of rope implied, and the 3
consciousness of what unknown and incalculable gulfs of inner earth must at this 3
moment be surrounding me. My endless descent and swinging flight through 3
goblin space, then, must have been real, and even now I must be lying helpless in 3
some nameless cavern world toward the core of the planet. Such a sudden 3
confirmation of ultimate horror was insupportable, and a second time I lapsed 3
into merciful oblivion. 3
3
When I say oblivion, I do not imply that I was free from dreams. On the contrary, 3
my absence from the conscious world was marked by visions of the most 3
unutterable hideousness. God! ... If only I had not read so much Egyptology 3
before coming to this land which is the fountain of all darkness and terror! This 3
second spell of fainting filled my sleeping mind anew with shivering realization 3
of the country and its archaic secrets, and through some damnable chance my 3
dreams turned to the ancient notions of the dead and their sojournings in soul 3
and body beyond those mysterious tombs which were more houses than graves. 3
I recalled, in dream-shapes which it is well that I do not remember, the peculiar 3
and elaborate construction of Egyptian sepulchers; and the exceedingly singular 3
and terrific doctrines which determined this construction. 3
3
All these people thought of was death and the dead. They conceived of a literal 3
resurrection of the body which made them mummify it with desperate care, and 3
preserve all the vital organs in canopic jars near the corpse; whilst besides the 3
body they believed in two other elements, the soul, which after its weighing and 3
3
3
3
222 3
3
3
3
approval by Osiris dwelt in the land of the blest, and the obscure and portentous 3
ka or life-principle which wandered about the upper and lower worlds in a 3
horrible way, demanding occasional access to the preserved body, consuming 3
the food offerings brought by priests and pious relatives to the mortuary chapel, 3
and sometimes - as men whispered - taking its body or the wooden double 3
always buried beside it and stalking noxiously abroad on errands peculiarly 3
repellent. 3
3
For thousands of years those bodies rested gorgeously encased and staring 3
glassily upward when not visited by the ka, awaiting the day when Osiris should 3
restore both ka and soul, and lead forth the stiff legions of the dead from the 3
sunken houses of sleep. It was to have been a glorious rebirth - but not all souls 3
were approved, nor were all tombs inviolate, so that certain grotesque mistakes 3
and fiendish abnormalities were to be looked for. Even today the Arabs murmur 3
of unsanctified convocations and unwholesome worship in forgotten nether 3
abysses, which only winged invisible kas and soulless mummies may visit and 3
return unscathed. 3
3
Perhaps the most leeringly blood-congealing legends are those which relate to 3
certain perverse products of decadent priestcraft - composite mummies made by 3
the artificial union of human trunks and limbs with the heads of animals in 3
imitation of the elder gods. At all stages of history the sacred animals were 3
mummified, so that consecrated bulls, cats, ibises, crocodiles and the like might 3
return some day to greater glory. But only in the decadence did they mix the 3
human and the animal in the same mummy - only in the decadence, when they 3
did not understand the rights and prerogatives of the ka and the soul. 3
3
What happened to those composite mummies is not told of- at least publicly - 3
and it is certain that no Egyptologist ever found one. The whispers of Arabs are 3
very wild, and cannot be relied upon. They even hint that old Khephren - he of 3
the Sphinx, the Second Pyramid and the yawning gateway temple - lives far 3
underground wedded to the ghoul-queen Nitocris and ruling over the mummies 3
that are neither of man nor of beast. 3
3
It was of these - of Khephren and his consort and his strange armies of the hybrid 3
dead - that I dreamed, and that is why I am glad the exact dream-shapes have 3
faded from my memory. My most horrible vision was connected with an idle 3
question I had asked myself the day before when looking at the great carven 3
riddle of the desert and wondering with what unknown depth the temple close 3
to it might be secretly connected. That question, so innocent and whimsical then, 3
assumed in my dream a meaning of frenetic and hysterical madness ... what 3
huge and loathsome abnormality was the Sphinx originally carven to represent? 3
3
3
3
223 3
3
3
3
My second awakening - if awakening it was - is a memory of stark hideousness 3
which nothing else in my Hfe - save one thing which came after - can parallel; 3
and that life has been full and adventurous beyond most men's. Remember that I 3
had lost consciousness whilst buried beneath a cascade of falling rope whose 3
immensity revealed the cataclysmic depth of my present position. Now, as 3
perception returned, I felt the entire weight gone; and realized upon rolling over 3
that although I was still tied, gagged and blindfolded, some agency had removed 3
completely the suffocating hempen landslide which had overwhelmed me. The 3
significance of this condition, of course, came to me only gradually; but even so I 3
think it would have brought unconsciousness again had I not by this time 3
reached such a state of emotional exhaustion that no new horror could make 3
much difference. I was alone. . . with what? 3
3
Before I could torture myself with any new reflection, or make any fresh effort to 3
escape from my bonds, an additional circumstance became manifest. Pains not 3
formerly felt were racking my arms and legs, and I seemed coated with a 3
profusion of dried blood beyond anything my former cuts and abrasions could 3
furnish. My chest, too, seemed pierced by a hundred wounds, as though some 3
malign, titanic ibis had been pecking at it. Assuredly the agency which had 3
removed the rope was a hostile one, and had begun to wreak terrible injuries 3
upon me when somehow impelled to desist. Yet at the same time my sensations 3
were distinctly the reverse of what one might expect. Instead of sinking into a 3
bottomless pit of despair, I was stirred to a new courage and action; for now I felt 3
that the evil forces were physical things which a fearless man might encounter on 3
an even basis. 3
3
On the strength of this thought I tugged again at my bonds, and used all the art 3
of a lifetime to free myself as I had so often done amidst the glare of lights and 3
the applause of vast crowds. The familiar details of my escaping process 3
commenced to engross me, and now that the long rope was gone I half regained 3
my belief that the supreme horrors were hallucinations after all, and that there 3
had never been any terrible shaft, measureless abyss or interminable rope. Was I 3
after all in the gateway temple of Khephren beside the Sphinx, and had the 3
sneaking Arabs stolen in to torture me as I lay helpless there? At any rate, I must 3
be free. Let me stand up unbound, ungagged, and with eyes open to catch any 3
glimmer of light which might come trickling from any source, and I could 3
actually delight in the combat against evil and treacherous foes! 3
3
How long I took in shaking off my encumbrances I cannot tell. It must have been 3
longer than in my exhibition performances, because I was wounded, exhausted, 3
and enervated by the experiences I had passed through. When I was finally free, 3
and taking deep breaths of a chill, damp, evilly spiced air all the more horrible 3
when encountered without the screen of gag and blindfold edges, I found that I 3
3
3
3
224 3
3
3
3
was too cramped and fatigued to move at once. There I lay, trying to stretch a 3
frame bent and mangled, for an indefinite period, and straining my eyes to catch 3
a glimpse of some ray of light which would give a hint as to my position. 3
3
By degrees my strength and flexibility returned, but my eyes beheld nothing. As 3
I staggered to my feet I peered diligently in every direction, yet met only an 3
ebony blackness as great as that I had known when blindfolded. I tried my legs, 3
blood-encrusted beneath my shredded trousers, and found that I could walk; yet 3
could not decide in what direction to go. Obviously I ought not to walk at 3
random, and perhaps retreat directly from the entrance I sought; so I paused to 3
note the difference of the cold, fetid, natron-scented air-current which I had 3
never ceased to feel. Accepting the point of its source as the possible entrance to 3
the abyss, I strove to keep track of this landmark and to walk consistently toward 3
it. 3
3
I had a match-box with me, and even a small electric flashlight; but of course the 3
pockets of my tossed and tattered clothing were long since emptied of all heavy 3
articles. As I walked cautiously in the blackness, the draft grew stronger and 3
more offensive, till at length I could regard it as nothing less than a tangible 3
stream of detestable vapor pouring out of some aperture like the smoke of the 3
genie from the fisherman's jar in the Eastern tale. The East . . . Egypt . . . truly, this 3
dark cradle of civilization was ever the wellspring of horrors and marvels 3
unspeakable! 3
3
The more I reflected on the nature of this cavern wind, the greater my sense of 3
disquiet became; for although despite its odor I had sought its source as at least 3
an indirect clue to the outer world, I now saw plainly that this foul emanation 3
could have no admixture or connection whatsoever with the clean air of the 3
Libyan Desert, but must be essentially a thing vomited from sinister gulfs still 3
lower down. I had, then, been walking in the wrong direction! 3
3
After a moment's reflection I decided not to retrace my steps. Away from the 3
draft I would have no landmarks, for the roughly level rock floor was devoid of 3
distinctive configurations. If, however, I followed up the strange current, I would 3
undoubtedly arrive at an aperture of some sort, from whose gate I could perhaps 3
work round the walls to the opposite side of this Cyclopean and otherwise 3
unnavigable hall. That I might fail, I well realized. I saw that this was no part of 3
Khephren's gateway temple which tourists know, and it struck me that this 3
particular hall might be unknown even to archaeologists, and merely stumbled 3
upon by the inquisitive and malignant Arabs who had imprisoned me. If so, was 3
there any present gate of escape to the known parts or to the outer air? 3
3
3
3
225 3
3
3
3
What evidence, indeed, did I now possess that this was the gateway temple at 3
all? For a moment all my wildest speculations rushed back upon me, 'and I 3
thought of that vivid melange of impressions - descent, suspension in space, the 3
rope, my wounds, and the dreams that were frankly dreams. Was this the end of 3
life for me? Or indeed, would it be merciful if this moment were the end? I could 3
answer none of my own questions, but merely kept on, till Fate for a third time 3
reduced me to oblivion. 3
3
This time there were no dreams, for the suddenness of the incident shocked me 3
out of all thought either conscious or subconscious. Tripping on an unexpected 3
descending step at a point where the offensive draft became strong enough to 3
offer an actual physical resistance, I was precipitated headlong down a black 3
flight of huge stone stairs into a gulf of hideousness unrelieved. 3
3
That I ever breathed again is a tribute to the inherent vitality of the healthy 3
human organism. Often I look back to that night and feel a touch of actual humor 3
in those repeated lapses of consciousness; lapses whose succession reminded me 3
at the time of nothing more than the crude cinema melodramas of that period. Of 3
course, it is possible that the repeated lapses never occurred; and that all the 3
features of that underground nightmare were merely the dreams of one long 3
coma which began with the shock of my descent into that abyss and ended with 3
the healing balm of the outer air and of the rising sun which found me stretched 3
on the sands of Gizeh before the sardonic and dawn-flushed face of the Great 3
Sphinx. 3
3
I prefer to believe this latter explanation as much as I can, hence was glad when 3
the police told me that the barrier to Krephren's gateway temple had been found 3
unfastened, and that a sizeable rift to the surface did actually exist in one corner 3
of the still buried part. I was glad, too, when the doctors pronounced my wounds 3
only those to be expected from my seizure, blindfolding, lowering, struggling 3
with bonds, falling some distance - perhaps into a depression in the temple's 3
inner gallery - dragging myself to the outer barrier and escaping from it, and 3
experiences like that.., a very soothing diagnosis. And yet I know that there must 3
be more than appears on the surface. That extreme descent is too vivid a memory 3
to be dismissed - and it is odd that no one has ever been able to find a man 3
answering the description of my guide, Abdul Reis el Drogman- the tomb- 3
throated guide who looked and smiled like King Khephren. 3
3
I have digressed from my connected narrative - perhaps in the vain hope of 3
evading the telling of that final incident; that incident which of all is most 3
certainly an hallucination. But I promised to relate it, and I do not break 3
promises. When I recovered - or seemed to recover - my senses after that fall 3
down the black stone stairs, I was quite as alone and in darkness as before. The 3
3
3
3
226 3
3
3
3
windy stench, bad enough before, was now fiendish; yet I had acquired enough 3
famiharity by this time to bear it stoically. Dazedly I began to crawl away from 3
the place whence the putrid wind came, and with my bleeding hands felt the 3
colossal blocks of a mighty pavement. Once my head struck against a hard 3
object, and when I felt of it I learned that it was the base of a column - a column 3
of unbelievable immensity - whose surface was covered with gigantic chiseled 3
hieroglyphics very perceptible to my touch. 3
3
Crawling on, I encountered other titan columns at incomprehensible distances 3
apart; when suddenly my attention was captured by the realization of something 3
which must have been impinging on my subconscious hearing long before the 3
conscious sense was aware of it. 3
3
From some still lower chasm in earth's bowels were proceeding certain sounds, 3
measured and definite, and like nothing I had ever heard before. That they were 3
very ancient and distinctly ceremonial I felt almost intuitively; and much reading 3
in Egyptology led me to associate them with the flute, the sambuke, the sistrum, 3
and the tympa num. In their rhythmic piping, droning, rattling and beat ing I felt 3
an element of terror beyond all the known terrors of earth - a terror peculiarly 3
dissociated from personal fear, and taking the form of a sort of objective pity for 3
our planet, that it should hold within its depths such horrors as must lie beyond 3
these aegipanic cacophonies. The sounds increased in volume, and I felt that they 3
were approaching. Then - and may all the gods of all pantheons unite to keep the 3
like from my ears again - I began to hear, faintly and afar off, the morbid and 3
millennial tramping of the marching things. 3
3
It was hideous that footfalls so dissimilar should move in such perfect rhythm. 3
The training of unhallowed thousands of years must lie behind that march of 3
earth's inmost monstrosities ... padding, clicking, walking, stalking, rumbling, 3
lumbering, crawling.. . and all to the abhorrent discords of those mocking 3
instruments. And then - God keep the memory of those Arab legends out of my 3
3
head! - the mummies without souls ... the meeting-place of the wandering 3
3
the hordes of the devil-cursed pharaonic dead of forty centuries.. . the composite 3
mummies led through the uttermost onyx voids by King Khephren and his 3
ghoul-queen Nitocris . . . 3
3
The tramping drew nearer - Heaven save me from the sound of those feet and 3
paws and hooves and pads and talons as it commenced to acquire detail! Down 3
limitless reaches of sunless pavement a spark of light flickered in the malodorous 3
wind and I drew behind the enormous circumference of a Cyclopic column that I 3
might escape for a while the horror that was stalking million-footed toward me 3
through gigantic hypostyles of inhuman dread and phobic antiquity. The flickers 3
increased, and the tramping and dissonant rhythm grew sickeningly loud. In the 3
3
3
3
227 3
3
3
3
quivering orange light there stood faintly forth a scene of such stony awe that I 3
gasped from sheer wonder that conquered even fear and repulsion. Bases of 3
columns whose middles were higher than human sight. . . mere bases of things 3
that must each dwarf the Eiffel Tower to insignificance . . . hieroglyphics carved 3
by unthinkable hands in caverns where daylight can be only a remote legend. . . 3
3
I would not look at the marching things. That I desperately resolved as I heard 3
their creaking joints and nitrous wheezing above the dead music and the dead 3
tramping. It was merciful that they did not speak... but God! their crazy torches 3
began to cast shadows on the surface of those stupendous columns. 3
Hippopotami should not have human hands and carzy torches. . . men should not 3
have the heads of crocodiles. . . 3
3
I tried to turn away, but the shadows and the sounds and the stench were 3
everywhere. Then I remembered something I used to do in half-conscious 3
nightmares as a boy, and began to repeat to myself, 'This is a dream! This is a 3
dream!' But it was of no use, and I could only shut my eyes and pray ... at least, 3
that is what I think I did, for one is never sure in visions - and I know this can 3
have been nothing more. I wondered whether I should ever reach the world 3
again, and at times would furtively open my eyes to see if I could discern any 3
feature of the place other than the wind of spiced putrefaction, the topless 3
columns, and the thaumatropically grotesque shadows of abnormal horror. The 3
sputtering glare of multiplying torches now shone, and unless this hellish place 3
were wholly without walls, I could not fail to see some boundary or fixed 3
landmark soon. But I had to shut my eyes again when I realized how many of the 3
things were assembling - and when I glimpsed a certain object walking solemnly 3
and steadily without any body above the waist. 3
3
A fiendish and ululant corpse-gurgle or death-rattle now split the very 3
atmosphere - the charnel atmosphere poisonous with naftha and bitumen blasts - 3
in one concerted chorus from the ghoulish legion of hybrid blasphemies. My 3
eyes, perversely shaken open, gazed for an instant upon a sight which no human 3
creature could even imagine without panic, fear and physical exhaustion. The 3
things had filed ceremonially in one direction, the direction of the noisome wind, 3
where the light of their torches showed their bended heads - or the bended heads 3
of such as had heads. They were worshipping before a great black fetor-belching 3
aperture which reached up almost out of sight, -and which I could see was 3
flanked at right angles by two giant staircases whose ends were far away in 3
shadow. One of these was indubitably the staircase I had fallen down. 3
3
The dimensions of the hole were fully in proportion with those of the columns - 3
an ordinary house would have been lost in it, and any average public building 3
could easily have been moved in and out. It was so vast a surface that only by 3
3
3
3
228 3
3
3
3
moving the eye could one trace its boundaries.. . so vast, so hideously black, and 3
so aromatically stinking . .. Directly in front of this yawning Polyphemus-door 3
the things were throwing objects - evidently sacrifices or religious offerings, to 3
judge by their gestures. Khephren was their leader; sneering King Khephren or 3
the guide Abdul Reis, crowned with a golden pshent and intoning endless 3
formulae with the hollow voice of the dead. By his side knelt beautiful Queen 3
Nitocris, whom I saw in profile for a moment, noting that the right half of her 3
face was eaten away by rats or other ghouls. And I shut my eyes again when I 3
saw what objects were being thrown as offerings to the fetid aperture or its 3
possible local deity. 3
3
It occurred to me that, judging from the elaborateness of this worship, the 3
concealed deity must be one of considerable importance. Was it Osiris or Isis, 3
Horus or Anubis, or some vast unknown God of the Dead still more central and 3
supreme? There is a legend that terrible altars and colossi were reared to an 3
Unknown One before ever the known gods were worshipped. . . 3
3
And now, as I steeled myself to watch the rapt and sepulchral adorations of 3
those nameless things, a thought of escape flashed upon me. The hall was dim, 3
and the columns heavy with shadow. With every creature of that nightmare 3
throng absorbed in shocking raptures, it might be barely possible for me to creep 3
past to the far-away end of one of the staircases and ascend unseen; trusting to 3
Fate and skill to deliver me from the upper reaches. Where I was, I neither knew 3
nor seriously reflected upon - and for a 3
3
moment it struck me as amusing to plan a serious escape from that which I knew 3
to be a dream. Was I in some hidden and unsuspected lower realm of 3
Khephren' s gateway temple - that temple which generations have persis tently 3
called the Temple of the Sphinx? I could not conjecture, but I resolved to ascend 3
to life and consciousness if wit and muscle could carry me. 3
3
Wriggling flat on my stomach, I began the anxious journey toward the foot of the 3
left-hand staircase, which seemed the more accessible of the two. I cannot 3
describe the incidents and sensations of that crawl, but they may be guessed 3
when one reflects on what I had to watch steadily in that malign, wind-blown 3
torchlight in order to avoid detection. The bottom of the staircase was, as I have 3
said, far away in shadow, as it had to be to rise without a bend to the dizzy 3
parapeted landing above the titanic aperture. This placed the last stages of my 3
crawl at some distance from the noisome herd, though the spectacle chilled me 3
even when quite remote at my right. 3
3
At length I succeeded in reaching the steps and began to climb; keeping close to 3
the wall, on which I observed decorations of the most hideous sort, and relying 3
3
3
3
229 3
3
3
3
for safety on the absorbed, ecstatic interest with which the monstrosities watched 3
the foul-breezed aperture and the impious objects of nourishment they had flung 3
on the pavement before it. Though the staircase was huge and steep, fashioned of 3
vast porphyry blocks as if for the feet of a giant, the ascent seemed virtually 3
interminable. Dread of discovery and the pain which renewed exercise had 3
brought to my wounds combined to make that upward crawl a thing of 3
agonizing memory. I had intended, on reaching the landing, to climb 3
immediately onward along whatever upper staircase might mount from there; 3
stopping for no last look at the carrion abominations that pawed and genuflected 3
some seventy or eighty feet below - yet a sudden repetition of that thunderous 3
corpse-gurgle and death-rattle chorus, coming as I had nearly gained the top of 3
the flight and showing by its ceremonial rhythm that it was not an alarm of my 3
discovery, caused me to pause and peer cautiously over the parapet. 3
3
The monstrosities were hailing something which had poked itself out of the 3
nauseous aperture to seize the hellish fare proffered it. It was something quite 3
ponderous, even as seen from my height; something yellowish and hairy, and 3
endowed with a sort of nervous motion. It was as large, perhaps, as a good-sized 3
hippopotamus, but very curiously shaped. It seemed to have no neck, but five 3
separate shaggy heads springing in a row from a roughly cylindrical trunk; the 3
first very small, the second good-sized, the third and fourth equal and largest of 3
all, and the fifth rather small, though not so small as the first. 3
3
Out of these heads darted curious rigid tentacles which seized ravenously on the 3
excessively great quantities of unmentionable food placed before the aperture. 3
Once in a while the thing would leap up, and occasionally it would retreat into 3
its den in a very odd manner. Its locomotion was so inexplicable that I stared in 3
fascination, wishing it would emerge farther from the cavernous lair beneath me. 3
3
Then it did emerge ... it did emerge, and at the sight I turned and fled into the 3
darkness up the higher staircase that rose behind me; fled unknowingly up 3
incredible steps and ladders and inclined planes to which no human sight or 3
logic guided me, and which I must ever relegate to the world of dreams for want 3
of any confirmation. It must have been a dream, or the dawn would never have 3
found me breathing on the sands of Gizeh before the sardonic dawn-flushed face 3
of the Great Sphinx. 3
3
The Great Sphinx! God! - that idle question I asked myself on that sun-blest 3
morning before ... what huge and loathsome abnormality was the Sphinx 3
originally carven to represent? 3
3
Accursed is the sight, be it in dream or not, that revealed to me the supreme 3
horror - the unknown God of the Dead, which licks its colossal chops in the 3
3
3
3
230 3
3
3
3
unsuspected abyss, fed hideous morsels by soulless absurdities that should not 3
exist. The five-headed monster that emerged ... that five-headed monster as 3
large as a hippopotamus ... the five headed monster - and that of which it is the 3
merest forepaw. . . 3
3
But I survived, and I know it was only a dream. 3

3
There is nothing more absurd, as 1 view it, than that conventional association of 3
the homely and the wholesome which seems to pervade the psychology of the 3
multitude. Mention a bucolic Yankee setting, a bungling and thick-fibred village 3
undertaker, and a careless mishap in a tomb, and no average reader can be 3
brought to expect more than a hearty albeit grotesque phase of comedy. God 3
knows, though, that the prosy tale which George Birch's death permits me to tell 3
has in it aspects beside which some of our darkest tragedies are light. 3
3
Birch acquired a limitation and changed his business in 1881, yet never discussed 3
the case when he could avoid it. Neither did his old physician Dr. Davis, who 3
died years ago. It was generally stated that the affliction and shock were results 3
of an unlucky slip whereby Birch had locked himself for nine hours in the 3
receiving tomb of Peck Valley Cemetery, escaping only by crude and disastrous 3
mechanical means; but while this much was undoubtedly true, there were other 3
and blacker things which the man used to whisper to me in his drunken delirium 3
toward the last. He confided in me because I was his doctor, and because he 3
probably felt the need of confiding in someone else after Davis died. He was a 3
bachelor, wholly without relatives. 3
3
Birch, before 1881, had been the village undertaker of Peck Valley; and was a 3
very calloused and primitive specimen even as such specimens go. The practices 3
I heard attributed to him would be unbelievable today, at least in a city; and even 3
Peck Valley would have shuddered a bit had it known the easy ethics of its 3
mortuary artist in such debatable matters as the ownership of costly "laying-out" 3
apparel invisible beneath the casket's lid, and the degree of dignity to be 3
maintained in posing and adapting the unseen members of lifeless tenants to 3
containers not always calculated with sublimest accuracy. Most distinctly Birch 3
was lax, insensitive, and professionally undesirable; yet I still think he was not an 3
evil man. He was merely crass of fibre and function- thoughtless, careless, and 3
liquorish, as his easily avoidable accident proves, and without that modicum of 3
imagination which holds the average citizen within certain limits fixed by taste. 3
3
Just where to begin Birch's story I can hardly decide, since I am no practiced 3
teller of tales. I suppose one should start in the cold December of 1880, when the 3
ground froze and the cemetery delvers found they could dig no more graves till 3
spring. Fortunately the village was small and the death rate low, so that it was 3
3
3
3
232 3
3
3
3
possible to give all of Birch's inanimate charges a temporary haven in the single 3
antiquated receiving tomb. The undertaker grew doubly lethargic in the bitter 3
weather, and seemed to outdo even himself in carelessness. Never did he knock 3
together flimsier and ungainlier caskets, or disregard more flagrantly the needs 3
of the rusty lock on the tomb door which he slammed open and shut with such 3
nonchalant abandon. 3
3
At last the spring thaw came, and graves were laboriously prepared for the nine 3
silent harvests of the grim reaper which waited in the tomb. Birch, though 3
dreading the bother of removal and interment, began his task of transference one 3
disagreeable April morning, but ceased before noon because of a heavy rain that 3
seemed to irritate his horse, after having laid but one mortal tenement to its 3
permanent rest. That was Darius Peck, the nonagenarian, whose grave was not 3
far from the tomb. Birch decided that he would begin the next day with little old 3
Matthew Tenner, whose grave was also near by; but actually postponed the 3
matter for three days, not getting to work till Good Priday, the 15th. Being 3
without superstition, he did not heed the day at all; though ever afterward he 3
refused to do anything of importance on that fateful sixth day of the week. 3
Certainly, the events of that evening greatly changed George Birch. 3
3
On the afternoon of Triday, April 15th, then. Birch set out for the tomb with 3
horse and wagon to transfer the body of Matthew Tenner. That he was not 3
perfectly sober, he subsequently admitted; though he had not then taken to the 3
wholesale drinking by which he later tried to forget certain things. He was just 3
dizzy and careless enough to annoy his sensitive horse, which as he drew it 3
viciously up at the tomb neighed and pawed and tossed its head, much as on 3
that former occasion when the rain had vexed it. The day was clear, but a high 3
wind had sprung up; and Birch was glad to get to shelter as he unlocked the iron 3
door and entered the side-hill vault. Another might not have relished the damp, 3
odorous chamber with the eight carelessly placed coffins; but Birch in those days 3
was insensitive, and was concerned only in getting the right coffin for the right 3
grave. He had not forgotten the criticism aroused when Hannah Bixby's 3
relatives, wishing to transport her body to the cemetery in the city whither they 3
had moved, found the casket of Judge Capwell beneath her headstone. 3
3
The light was dim, but Birch's sight was good, and he did not get Asaph 3
Sawyer's coffin by mistake, although it was very similar. He had, indeed, made 3
that coffin for Matthew Tenner; but had cast it aside at last as too awkward and 3
flimsy, in a fit of curious sentimentality aroused by recalling how kindly and 3
generous the little old man had been to him during his bankruptcy five years 3
before. He gave old Matt the very best his skill could produce, but was thrifty 3
enough to save the rejected specimen, and to use it when Asaph Sawyer died of a 3
malignant fever. Sawyer was not a lovable man, and many stories were told of 3
3
3
3
233 3
3
3
3
his almost inhuman vindictiveness and tenacious memory for wrongs real or 3
fancied. To him Birch had felt no compunction in assigning the carelessly made 3
coffin which he now pushed out of the way in his quest for the Fenner casket. 3
3
It was just as he had recognised old Matt's coffin that the door slammed to in the 3
wind, leaving him in a dusk even deeper than before. The narrow transom 3
admitted only the feeblest of rays, and the overhead ventilation funnel virtually 3
none at all; so that he was reduced to a profane fumbling as he made his halting 3
way among the long boxes toward the latch. In this funereal twilight he rattled 3
the rusty handles, pushed at the iron panels, and wondered why the massive 3
portal had grown so suddenly recalcitrant. In this twilight too, he began to 3
realise the truth and to shout loudly as if his horse outside could do more than 3
neigh an unsympathetic reply. For the long-neglected latch was obviously 3
broken, leaving the careless undertaker trapped in the vault, a victim of his own 3
oversight. 3
3
The thing must have happened at about three-thirty in the afternoon. Birch, 3
being by temperament phlegmatic and practical, did not shout long; but 3
proceeded to grope about for some tools which he recalled seeing in a corner of 3
the tomb. It is doubtful whether he was touched at all by the horror and exquisite 3
weirdness of his position, but the bald fact of imprisonment so far from the daily 3
paths of men was enough to exasperate him thoroughly. His day's work was 3
sadly interrupted, and unless chance presently brought some rambler hither, he 3
might have to remain all night or longer. The pile of tools soon reached, and a 3
hammer and chisel selected. Birch returned over the coffins to the door. The air 3
had begun to be exceedingly unwholesome; but to this detail he paid no 3
attention as he toiled, half by feeling, at the heavy and corroded metal of the 3
latch. He would have given much for a lantern or bit of candle; but lacking these, 3
bungled semi-sightlessly as best he might. 3
3
When he perceived that the latch was hopelessly unyielding, at least to such 3
meagre tools and under such tenebrous conditions as these. Birch glanced about 3
for other possible points of escape. The vault had been dug from a hillside, so 3
that the narrow ventilation funnel in the top ran through several feet of earth, 3
making this direction utterly useless to consider. Over the door, however, the 3
high, slit-like transom in the brick facade gave promise of possible enlargement 3
to a diligent worker; hence upon this his eyes long rested as he racked his brains 3
for means to reach it. There was nothing like a ladder in the tomb, and the coffin 3
niches on the sides and rear- which Birch seldom took the trouble to use- 3
afforded no ascent to the space above the door. Only the coffins themselves 3
remained as potential stepping-stones, and as he considered these he speculated 3
on the best mode of transporting them. Three coffin-heights, he reckoned, would 3
permit him to reach the transom; but he could do better with four. The boxes 3
3
3
3
234 3
3
3
3
were fairly even, and could be piled up like blocks; so he began to compute how 3
he might most stably use the eight to rear a scalable platform four deep. As he 3
planned, he could not but wish that the units of his contemplated staircase had 3
been more securely made. Whether he had imagination enough to wish they 3
were empty, is strongly to be doubted. 3
3
Finally he decided to lay a base of three parallel with the wall, to place upon this 3
two layers of two each, and upon these a single box to serve as the platform. This 3
arrangement could be ascended with a minimum of awkwardness, and would 3
furnish the desired height. Better still, though, he would utilise only two boxes of 3
the base to support the superstructure, leaving one free to be piled on top in case 3
the actual feat of escape required an even greater altitude. And so the prisoner 3
toiled in the twilight, heaving the unresponsive remnants of mortality with little 3
ceremony as his miniature Tower of Babel rose course by course. Several of the 3
coffins began to split under the stress of handling, and he planned to save the 3
stoutly built casket of little Matthew Tenner for the top, in order that his feet 3
might have as certain a surface as possible. In the semi-gloom he trusted mostly 3
to touch to select the right one, and indeed came upon it almost by accident, 3
since it tumbled into his hands as if through some odd volition after he had 3
unwittingly placed it beside another on the third layer. 3
3
The tower at length finished, and his aching arms rested by a pause during 3
which he sat on the bottom step of his grim device. Birch cautiously ascended 3
with his tools and stood abreast of the narrow transom. The borders of the space 3
were entirely of brick, and there seemed little doubt but that he could shortly 3
chisel away enough to allow his body to pass. As his hammer blows began to 3
fall, the horse outside whinnied in a tone which may have been encouraging and 3
to others may have been mocking. In either case it would have been appropriate; 3
for the unexpected tenacity of the easy-looking brickwork was surely a sardonic 3
commentary on the vanity of mortal hopes, and the source of a task whose 3
performance deserved every possible stimulus. 3
3
Dusk fell and found Birch still toiling. He worked largely by feeling now, since 3
newly gathered clouds hid the moon; and though progress was still slow, he felt 3
heartened at the extent of his encroachments on the top and bottom of the 3
aperture. He could, he was sure, get out by midnight- though it is characteristic 3
of him that this thought was untinged with eerie implications. Undisturbed by 3
oppressive reflections on the time, the place, and the company beneath his feet, 3
he philosophically chipped away the stony brickwork; cursing when a fragment 3
hit him in the face, and laughing when one struck the increasingly excited horse 3
that pawed near the cypress tree. In time the hole grew so large that he ventured 3
to try his body in it now and then, shifting about so that the coffins beneath him 3
rocked and creaked. He would not, he found, have to pile another on his 3
3
3
3
235 3
3
3
3
platform to make the proper height; for the hole was on exactly the right level to 3
use as soon as its size might permit. 3
3
It must have been midnight at least when Birch decided he could get through the 3
transom. Tired and perspiring despite many rests, he descended to the floor and 3
sat a while on the bottom box to gather strength for the final wriggle and leap to 3
the ground outside. The hungry horse was neighing repeatedly and almost 3
uncannily, and he vaguely wished it would stop. He was curiously unelated over 3
his impending escape, and almost dreaded the exertion, for his form had the 3
indolent stoutness of early middle age. As he remounted the splitting coffins he 3
felt his weight very poignantly; especially when, upon reaching the topmost one, 3
he heard that aggravated crackle which bespeaks the wholesale rending of wood. 3
He had, it seems, planned in vain when choosing the stoutest coffin for the 3
platform; for no sooner was his full bulk again upon it than the rotting lid gave 3
way, jouncing him two feet down on a surface which even he did not care to 3
imagine. Maddened by the sound, or by the stench which billowed forth even to 3
the open air, the waiting horse gave a scream that was too frantic for a neigh, and 3
plunged madly off through the night, the wagon rattling crazily behind it. 3
3
Birch, in his ghastly situation, was now too low for an easy scramble out of the 3
enlarged transom; but gathered his energies for a determined try. Clutching the 3
edges of the aperture, he sought to pull himself up, when he noticed a queer 3
retardation in the form of an apparent drag on both his ankles. In another 3
moment he knew fear for the first time that night; for struggle as he would, he 3
could not shake clear of the unknown grasp which held his feet in relentless 3
captivity. Horrible pains, as of savage wounds, shot through his calves; and in 3
his mind was a vortex of fright mixed with an unquenchable materialism that 3
suggested splinters, loose nails, or some other attribute of a breaking wooden 3
box. Perhaps he screamed. At any rate he kicked and squirmed frantically and 3
automatically whilst his consciousness was almost eclipsed in a half-swoon. 3
3
Instinct guided him in his wriggle through the transom, and in the crawl which 3
followed his jarring thud on the damp ground. He could not walk, it appeared, 3
and the emerging moon must have witnessed a horrible sight as he dragged his 3
bleeding ankles toward the cemetery lodge; his fingers clawing the black mould 3
in brainless haste, and his body responding with that maddening slowness from 3
which one suffers when chased by the phantoms of nightmare. There was 3
evidently, however, no pursuer; for he was alone and alive when Armington, the 3
lodge-keeper, answered his feeble clawing at the door. 3
3
Armington helped Birch to the outside of a spare bed and sent his little son 3
Edwin for Dr. Davis. The afflicted man was fully conscious, but would say 3
nothing of any consequence; merely muttering such things as "Oh, my ankles!". 3
3
3
3
236 3
3
3
3
"Let go!", or "Shut in the tomb". Then the doctor came with his medicine-case 3
and asked crisp questions, and removed the patient's outer clothing, shoes, and 3
socks. The wounds- for both ankles were frightfully lacerated about the Achilles' 3
tendons- seemed to puzzle the old physician greatly, and finally almost to 3
frighten him. His questioning grew more than medically tense, and his hands 3
shook as he dressed the mangled members; binding them as if he wished to get 3
the wounds out of sight as quickly as possible. 3
3
For an impersonal doctor, Davis' ominous and awestruck cross-examination 3
became very strange indeed as he sought to drain from the weakened undertaker 3
every least detail of his horrible experience. He was oddly anxious to know if 3
Birch were sure- absolutely sure- of the identity of that top coffin of the pile; how 3
he had chosen it, how he had been certain of it as the Tenner coffin in the dusk, 3
and how he had distinguished it from the inferior duplicate coffin of vicious 3
Asaph Sawyer. Would the firm Tenner casket have caved in so readily? Davis, an 3
old-time village practitioner, had of course seen both at the respective funerals, 3
as indeed he had attended both Tenner and Sawyer in their last illnesses. He had 3
even wondered, at Sawyer's funeral, how the vindictive farmer had managed to 3
lie straight in a box so closely akin to that of the diminutive Tenner. 3
3
After a full two hours Dr. Davis left, urging Birch to insist at all times that his 3
wounds were caused entirely by loose nails and splintering wood. What else, he 3
added, could ever in any case be proved or believed? But it would be well to say 3
as little as could be said, and to let no other doctor treat the wounds. Birch 3
heeded this advice all the rest of his life till he told me his story; and when I saw 3
the scars- ancient and whitened as they then were- 1 agreed that he was wise in 3
so doing. He always remained lame, for the great tendons had been severed; but 3
I think the greatest lameness was in his soul. His thinking processes, once so 3
phlegmatic and logical, had become ineffaceably scarred; and it was pitiful to 3
note his response to certain chance allusions such as "Triday", "Tomb", "Coffin", 3
and words of less obvious concatenation. His frightened horse had gone home, 3
but his frightened wits never quite did that. He changed his business, but 3
something always preyed upon him. It may have been just fear, and it may have 3
been fear mixed with a queer belated sort of remorse for bygone crudities. His 3
drinking, of course, only aggravated what it was meant to alleviate. 3
3
When Dr. Davis left Birch that night he had taken a lantern and gone to the old 3
receiving tomb. The moon was shining on the scattered brick fragments and 3
marred facade, and the latch of the great door yielded readily to a touch from the 3
outside. Steeled by old ordeals in dissecting rooms, the doctor entered and 3
looked about, stifling the nausea of mind and body that everything in sight and 3
smell induced. He cried aloud once, and a little later gave a gasp that was more 3
terrible than a cry. Then he fled back to the lodge and broke all the rules of his 3
3
3
3
237 3
3
3
3
calling by rousing and shaking his patient, and hurling at him a succession of 3
shuddering whispers that seared into the bewildered ears like the hissing of 3
vitriol. 3
3
"It was Asaph's coffin. Birch, just as I thought! I knew his teeth, with the front 3
ones missing on the upper jaw- never, for God's sake, show those wounds! The 3
body was pretty badly gone, but if ever I saw vindictiveness on any face- or 3
former face... You know what a fiend he was for revenge- how he ruined old 3
Raymond thirty years after their boundary suit, and how he stepped on the 3
puppy that snapped at him a year ago last August. . . He was the devil incarnate. 3
Birch, and I believe his eye-for-an-eye fury could beat old Father Death himself. 3
God, what a rage! I'd hate to have it aimed at me! 3
3
"Why did you do it. Birch? He was a scoundrel, and I don't blame you for giving 3
him a cast-aside coffin, but you always did go too damned far! Well enough to 3
skimp on the thing some way, but you knew what a little man old Fenner was. 3
3
"I'll never get the picture out of my head as long as I live. You kicked hard, for 3
Asaph's coffin was on the floor. His head was broken in, and everything was 3
tumbled about. I've seen sights before, but there was one thing too much here. 3
An eye for an eye! Great heavens. Birch, but you got what you deserved. The 3
skull turned my stomach, but the other was worse- those ankles cut neatly off to 3
fit Matt Fenner's cast-aside coffin!" 3

In the valley of Nis the accursed waning moon shines thinly, tearing a path for its 3
light with feeble horns through the lethal foliage of a great upas-tree. And within 3
the depths of the valley, where the light reaches not, move forms not meant to be 3
beheld. Rank is the herbage on each slope, where evil vines and creeping plants 3
crawl amidst the stones of ruined palaces, twining tightly about broken columns 3
and strange monoliths, and heaving up marble pavements laid by forgotten 3
hands. And in trees that grow gigantic in crumbling courtyards leap little apes, 3
while in and out of deep treasure-vaults writhe poison serpents and scaly things 3
without a name. Vast are the stones which sleep beneath coverlets of dank moss, 3
and mighty were the walls from which they fell. For all time did their builders 3
erect them, and in sooth they yet serve nobly, for beneath them the grey toad 3
makes his habitation. 3
3
At the very bottom of the valley lies the river Than, whose waters are slimy and 3
filled with weeds. From hidden springs it rises, and to subterranean grottoes it 3
flows, so that the Daemon of the Valley knows not why its waters are red, nor 3
whither they are bound. 3
3
The Genie that haunts the moonbeams spake to the Daemon of the Valley, 3
saying, "I am old, and forget much. Tell me the deeds and aspect and name of 3
them who built these things of Stone." And the Daemon replied, "I am Memory, 3
and am wise in lore of the past, but I too am old. These beings were like the 3
waters of the river Than, not to be understood. Their deeds I recall not, for they 3
were but of the moment. Their aspect I recall dimly, it was like to that of the little 3
apes in the trees. Their name I recall clearly, for it rhymed with that of the river. 3
These beings of yesterday were called Man." 3
3
So the Genie flew back to the thin horned moon, and the Daemon looked intently 3
at a little ape in a tree that grew in a crumbling courtyard. 3

Nyarlathotep 3

Published November 1920 in The United Amateur 3
3
Nyarlathotep. . . the crawling chaos. . . I am the last. . . I will tell the audient void. . . 3
3
I do not recall distinctly when it began, but it was months ago. The general 3
tension was horrible. To a season of political and social upheaval was added a 3
strange and brooding apprehension of hideous physical danger; a danger 3
widespread and all-embracing, such a danger as may be imagined only in the 3
most terrible phantasms of the night. I recall that the people went about with 3
pale and worried faces, and whispered warnings and prophecies which no one 3
dared consciously repeat or acknowledge to himself that he had heard. A sense 3
of monstrous guilt was upon the land, and out of the abysses between the stars 3
swept chill currents that made men shiver in dark and lonely places. There was a 3
demoniac alteration in the sequence of the seasons the autumn heat lingered 3
fearsomely, and everyone felt that the world and perhaps the universe had 3
passed from the control of known gods or forces to that of gods or forces which 3
were unknown. 3
3
And it was then that Nyarlathotep came out of Egypt. Who he was, none could 3
tell, but he was of the old native blood and looked like a Pharaoh. The fellahin 3
knelt when they saw him, yet could not say why. He said he had risen up out of 3
the blackness of twenty-seven centuries, and that he had heard messages from 3
places not on this planet. Into the lands of civilisation came Nyarlathotep, 3
swarthy, slender, and sinister, always buying strange instruments of glass and 3
metal and combining them into instruments yet stranger. He spoke much of the 3
sciences of electricity and psychology and gave exhibitions of power which sent 3
his spectators away speechless, yet which swelled his fame to exceeding 3
magnitude. Men advised one another to see Nyarlathotep, and shuddered. And 3
where Nyarlathotep went, rest vanished, for the small hours were rent with the 3
screams of nightmare. Never before had the screams of nightmare been such a 3
public problem; now the wise men almost wished they could forbid sleep in the 3
small hours, that the shrieks of cities might less horribly disturb the pale, pitying 3
moon as it glimmered on green waters gliding under bridges, and old steeples 3
crumbling against a sickly sky. 3
3
I remember when Nyarlathotep came to my city the great, the old, the terrible 3
city of unnumbered crimes. My friend had told me of him, and of the impelling 3
fascination and allurement of his revelations, and I burned with eagerness to 3
3
3
3
240 3
3
3
3
explore his uttermost mysteries. My friend said they were horrible and 3
impressive beyond my most fevered imaginings; and what was thrown on a 3
screen in the darkened room prophesied things none but Nyarlathotep dared 3
prophesy, and in the sputter of his sparks there was taken from men that which 3
had never been taken before yet which showed only in the eyes. And I heard it 3
hinted abroad that those who knew Nyarlathotep looked on sights which others 3
saw not. 3
3
It was in the hot autumn that I went through the night with the restless crowds 3
to see Nyarlathotep; through the stifling night and up the endless stairs into the 3
choking room. And shadowed on a screen, I saw hooded forms amidst ruins, and 3
yellow evil faces peering from behind fallen monuments. And I saw the world 3
battling against blackness; against the waves of destruction from ultimate space; 3
whirling, churning, struggling around the dimming, cooling sun. Then the 3
sparks played amazingly around the heads of the spectators, and hair stood up 3
on end whilst shadows more grotesque than I can tell came out and squatted on 3
the heads. And when I, who was colder and more scientific than the rest, 3
mumbled a trembling protest about imposture and static electricity, 3
Nyarlathotep drove us all out, down the dizzy stairs into the damp, hot, deserted 3
midnight streets. I screamed aloud that I was not afraid; that I never could be 3
afraid; and others screamed with me for solace. We swore to one another that the 3
city was exactly the same, and still alive; and when the electric lights began to 3
fade we cursed the company over and over again, and laughed at the queer faces 3
we made. 3
3
I believe we felt something coming down from the greenish moon, for when we 3
began to depend on its light we drifted into curious involuntary marching 3
formations and seemed to know our destinations though we dared not think of 3
them. Once we looked at the pavement and found the blocks loose and displaced 3
by grass, with scarce a line of rusted metal to show where the tramways had run. 3
And again we saw a tram-car, lone, windowless, dilapidated, and almost on its 3
side. When we gazed around the horizon, we could not find the third tower by 3
the river, and noticed that the silhouette of the second tower was ragged at the 3
top. Then we split up into narrow columns, each of which seemed drawn in a 3
different direction. One disappeared in a narrow alley to the left, leaving only the 3
echo of a shocking moan. Another filed down a weed-choked subway entrance, 3
howling with a laughter that was mad. My own column was sucked toward the 3
open country, and presently I felt a chill which was not of the hot autumn; for as 3
we stalked out on the dark moor, we beheld around us the hellish moon-glitter 3
of evil snows. Trackless, inexplicable snows, swept asunder in one direction only, 3
where lay a gulf all the blacker for its glittering walls. The column seemed very 3
thin indeed as it plodded dreamily into the gulf. I lingered behind, for the black 3
rift in the green-litten snow was frightful, and I thought I had heard the 3
3
3
3
241 3
3
3
3
reverberations of a disquieting wail as my companions vanished; but my power 3
to linger was slight. As if beckoned by those who had gone before, I half-floated 3
between the titanic snowdrifts, quivering and afraid, into the sightless vortex of 3
the unimaginable. 3
3
Screamingly sentient, dumbly delirious, only the gods that were can tell. A 3
sickened, sensitive shadow writhing in hands that are not hands, and whirled 3
blindly past ghastly midnights of rotting creation, corpses of dead worlds with 3
sores that were cities, charnel winds that brush the pallid stars and make them 3
flicker low. Beyond the worlds vague ghosts of monstrous things; half-seen 3
columns of unsanctifled temples that rest on nameless rocks beneath space and 3
reach up to dizzy vacua above the spheres of light and darkness. And through 3
this revolting graveyard of the universe the muffled, maddening beating of 3
drums, and thin, monotonous whine of blasphemous flutes from inconceivable, 3
unlighted chambers beyond Time; the detestable pounding and piping 3
whereunto dance slowly, awkwardly, and absurdly the gigantic, tenebrous 3
ultimate gods the blind, voiceless, mindless gargoyles whose soul is 3
Nyarlathotep. 3

Picktnan's Model 3
3
Written in 1926 3
3
Published October 1927 in Weird Tales 3
3
You needn't think I'm crazy, Eliot- plenty of others have queerer prejudices than 3
this. Why don't you laugh at Oliver's grandfather, who won't ride in a motor? If 3
I don't like that damned subway, it's my own business; and we got here more 3
quickly anyhow in the taxi. We'd have had to walk up the hill from Park Street if 3
we'd taken the car. 3
3
I know I'm more nervous than I was when you saw me last year, but you don't 3
need to hold a clinic over it. There's plenty of reason, God knows, and I fancy I'm 3
lucky to be sane at all. Why the third degree? You didn't use to be so inquisitive. 3
3
Well, if you must hear it, I don't know why you shouldn't. Maybe you ought to, 3
anyhow, for you kept writing me like a grieved parent when you heard I'd 3
begun to cut the Art Club and keep away from Pickman. Now that he's 3
disappeared I go round to the club once in a while, but my nerves aren't what 3
they were. 3
3
No, I don't know what's become of Pickman, and I don't like to guess. You might 3
have surmised I had some inside information when I dropped him- and that's 3
why I don't want to think where he's gone. Let the police find what they can- it 3
won't be much, judging from the fact that they don't know yet of the old North 3
End place he hired under the name of Peters. 3
3
I'm not sure that I could find it again myself- not that I'd ever try, even in broad 3
daylight! 3
3
Yes, I do know, or am afraid I know, why he maintained it. I'm coming to that. 3
And I think you'll understand before I'm through why I don't tell the police. 3
They would ask me to guide them, but I couldn't go back there even if I knew the 3
way. There was something there- and now I can't use the subway or (and you 3
may as well have your laugh at this, too) go down into cellars any more. 3
3
I should think you'd have known I didn't drop Pickman for the same silly 3
reasons that fussy old women like Dr. Reid or Joe Minot or Rosworth did. 3
Morbid art doesn't shock me, and when a man has the genius Pickman had I feel 3
it an honour to know him, no matter what direction his work takes. Boston never 3
had a greater painter than Richard Upton Pickman. I said it at first and I say it 3
3
3
3
243 3
3
3
3
still, and I never swenved an inch, either, when he showed that 'Ghoul Feeding'. 3
That, you remember, was when Minot cut him. 3
3
You know, it takes profound art and profound insight into Nature to turn out 3
stuff like Pickman's. Any magazine-cover hack can splash paint around wildly 3
and call it a nightmare or a Witches' Sabbath or a portrait of the devil, but only a 3
great painter can make such a thing really scare or ring true. That's because only 3
a real artist knows the actual anatomy of the terrible or the physiology of fear- 3
the exact sort of lines and proportions that connect up with latent instincts or 3
hereditary memories of fright, and the proper colour contrasts and lighting 3
effects to stir the dormant sense of strangeness. I don't have to tell you why a 3
Fuseli really brings a shiver while a cheap ghost-story frontispiece merely makes 3
us laugh. There's something those fellows catch- beyond life- that they're able to 3
make us catch for a second. Dore had it. Sime has it. Angarola of Chicago has it. 3
And Pickman had it as no man ever had it before or- I hope to Heaven- ever will 3
again. 3
3
Don't ask me what it is they see. You know, in ordinary art, there's all the 3
difference in the world between the vital, breathing things drawn from Nature or 3
models and the artificial truck that commercial small fry reel off in a bare studio 3
by rule. Well, I should say that the really weird artist has a kind of vision which 3
makes models, or summons up what amounts to actual scenes from the spectral 3
world he lives in. Anyhow, he manages to turn out results that differ from the 3
pretender's mince-pie dreams in just about the same way that the life painter's 3
results differ from the concoctions of a correspondence-school cartoonist. If I had 3
ever seen what Pickman saw- but no! Here, let's have a drink before we get any 3
deeper. God, I wouldn't be alive if I'd ever seen what that man- if he was a man- 3
saw ! 3
3
You recall that Pickman's forte was faces. I don't believe anybody since Goya 3
could put so much of sheer hell into a set of features or a twist of expression. 3
And before Goya you have to go back to the mediaeval chaps who did the 3
gargoyles and chimaeras on Notre Dame and Mont Saint-Michel. They believed 3
all sorts of things- and maybe they saw all sorts of things, too, for the Middle 3
Ages had some curious phases I remember your asking Pickman yourself once, 3
the year before you went away, wherever in thunder he got such ideas and 3
visions. Wasn't that a nasty laugh he gave you? It was partly because of that 3
laugh that Reid dropped him. Reid, you know, had just taken up comparative 3
pathology, and was full of pompous 'inside stuff about the biological or 3
evolutionary significance of this or that mental or physical symptom. He said 3
Pickman repelled him more and more every day, and almost frightened him 3
towards the last- that the fellow's features and expression were slowly 3
developing in a way he didn't like; in a way that wasn't human. He had a lot of 3
3
3
3
244 3
3
3
3
talk about diet, and mid Pickman must be abnormal and eccentric to the last 3
degree. I suppose you told Reid, if you and he had any correspondence over it, 3
that he'd let Pickman's paintings get on his nerves or harrow up his imagination. 3
I know I told him that myself- then. 3
3
But keep in mind that I didn't drop Pickman for anything like this. On the 3
contrary, my admiration for him kept growing; for that 'Ghoul Feeding' was a 3
tremendous achievement. As you know, the club wouldn't exhibit it, and the 3
Museum of Fine Arts wouldn't accept it as a gift; and I can add that nobody 3
would buy it, so Pickman had it right in his house till he went. Now his father 3
has it in Salem- you know Pickman comes of old Salem stock, and had a witch 3
ancestor hanged in 1692. 3
3
I got into the habit of calling on Pickman quite often, especially after I began 3
making notes for a monograph on weird art. Probably it was his work which put 3
the idea into my head, and anyhow, I found him a mine of data and suggestions 3
when I came to develop it. He showed me all the paintings and drawings he had 3
about; including some pen-and-ink sketches that would, I verily believe, have got 3
him kicked out of the club if many of the members had seen them. Before long I 3
was pretty nearly a devotee, and would listen for hours like a schoolboy to art 3
theories and philosophic speculations wild enough to qualify him for the 3
Danvers asylum. My hero-worship, coupled with the fact that people generally 3
were commencing to have less and less to do with him, made him get very 3
confidential with me; and one evening he hinted that if I were fairly close- 3
mouthed and none too squeamish, he might show me something rather unusual- 3
something a bit stronger than anything he had in the house. 3
3
'You know,' he said, 'there are things that won't do for Newbury Street- things 3
that are out of place here, and that can't be conceived here, anyhow. It's my 3
business to catch the overtones of the soul, and you won't find those in a 3
parvenu set of artificial streets on made land. Back Bay isn't Boston- it isn't 3
anything yet, because it's had no time to pick up memories and attract local 3
spirits. If there are any ghosts here, they're the tame ghosts of a salt marsh and a 3
shallow cove; and I want human ghosts- the ghosts of beings highly organized 3
enough to have looked on hell and known the meaning of what they saw. 3
3
'The place for an artist to live is the North End. If any aesthete were sincere, he'd 3
put up with the slums for the sake of the massed traditions. God, man! Don't you 3
realize that places like that weren't merely made, but actually grew? Generation 3
after generation lived and felt and died there, and in days when people weren't 3
afraid to live and fed and die. Don't you know there was a mill on Copp's Hill in 3
1632, and that half the present streets were laid out by 1650? I can show you 3
houses that have stood two centuries and a half and more; houses that have 3
3
3
3
245 3
3
3
3
witnessed what would make a modern house crumble into powder. What do 3
moderns know of life and the forces behind it? You call the Salem witchcraft a 3
delusion, but I'll wager my four-times-great-grandmother could have told you 3
things. They hanged her on Gallows Hill, with Cotton Mather looking 3
sanctimoniously on. Mather, damn him, was afraid somebody might succeed in 3
kicking free of this accursed cage of monotony- I wish someone had laid a spell 3
on him or sucked his blood in the night! 3
3
'I can show you a house he lived in, and I can show you another one he was 3
afraid to enter in spite of all his fine bold talk. He knew things he didn't dare put 3
into that stupid Magnalia or that puerile Wonders of the Invisible World. Look 3
here, do you know the whole North End once had a set of tunnels that kept 3
certain people in touch with each other's houses, and the burying ground, and 3
the sea? Let them prosecute and persecute above ground- things went on every 3
day that they couldn't reach, and voices laughed at night that they couldn't 3
place! 3
3
'Why, man, out of ten surviving houses built before 1700 and not moved since I'll 3
wager that in eight I can show you something queer in the cellar. There's hardly 3
a month that you don't read of workmen finding bricked-up arches and wells 3
leading nowhere in this or that old place as it comes down- you could see one 3
near Henchman Street from the elevated last year. There were witches and what 3
their spells summoned; pirates and what they brought in from the sea; 3
smugglers; privateers- and I tell you, people knew how to live, and how to 3
enlarge the bounds of life, in the old time! This wasn't the only world a bold and 3
wise man could know- faugh! And to think of today in contrast, with such pale- 3
pink brains that even a club of supposed artists gets shudders and convulsions if 3
a picture goes beyond the feelings of a Beacon Street tea-table! 3
3
'The only saving grace of the present is that it's too damned stupid to question 3
the past very closely. What do maps and records and guide-books really tell of 3
the North End? Bah! At a guess I'll guarantee to lead you to thirty or forty alleys 3
and networks of alleys north of Prince Street that aren't suspected by ten living 3
beings outside of the foreigners that swarm them. And what do those Dagoes 3
know of their meaning? No, Thurber, these ancient places are dreaming 3
gorgeously and over-flowing with wonder and terror and escapes from the 3
commonplace, and yet there's not a living soul to understand or profit by them. 3
Or rather, there's only one living soul- for I haven't been digging around in the 3
past for nothing ! 3
3
'See here, you're interested in this sort of thing. What if I told you that I've got 3
another studio up there, where I can catch the night-spirit of antique horror and 3
paint things that I couldn't even think of in Newbury Street? Naturally I don't 3
3
3
3
246 3
3
3
3
tell those cursed old maids at the club - with Reid, damn him, whispering even 3
as it is that I'm a sort of monster bound down the toboggan of reverse evolution. 3
Yes, Thurber, I decided long ago that one must paint terror as well as beauty 3
from life, so I did some exploring in places where I had reason to know terror 3
lives. 3
3
'I've got a place that I don't believe three living Nordic men besides myself have 3
ever seen. It isn't so very far from the elevated as distance goes, but it's centuries 3
away as the soul goes. I took it because of the queer old brick well in the cellar- 3
one of the sort I told you about. The shack's almost tumbling down so that 3
nobody else would live there, and I'd hate to tell you how little I pay for it. The 3
windows are boarded up, but I like that all the better, since I don't want daylight 3
for what I do. I paint in the cellar, where the inspiration is thickest, but I've other 3
rooms furnished on the ground floor. A Sicilian owns it, and I've hired it under 3
the name of Peters. 3
3
'Now, if you're game, I'll take you there tonight. I think you'd enjoy the pictures, 3
for, as I said, I've let myself go a bit there. It's no vast tour- I sometimes do it on 3
foot, for I don't want to attract attention with a taxi in such a place. We can take 3
the shuttle at the South Station for Battery Street, and after that the walk isn't 3
much.' 3
3
Well, Eliot, there wasn't much for me to do after that harangue but to keep 3
myself from running instead of walking for the first vacant cab we could sight. 3
We changed to the elevated at the South Station, and at about twelve o'clock had 3
climbed down the steps at Battery Street and struck along the old waterfront past 3
Constitution Wharf. I didn't keep track of the cross streets, and can't tell you yet 3
which it was we turned up, but I know it wasn't Greenough Lane. 3
3
When we did turn, it was to climb through the deserted length of the oldest and 3
dirtiest alley I ever saw in my life, with crumbling-looking gables, broken small- 3
paned windows, and archaic chimneys that stood out half-disintegrated against 3
the moonlit sky. I don't believe there were three houses in sight that hadn't been 3
standing in Cotton Mather's time- certainly I glimpsed at least two with an 3
overhang, and once I thought I saw a peaked roof-line of the almost forgotten 3
pre-gambrel type, though antiquarians tell us there are none left in Boston. 3
3
From that alley, which had a dim light, we turned to the left into an equally silent 3
and still narrower alley with no light at all: and in a minute made what I think 3
was an obtuse-angled bend towards the right in the dark. Not long after this 3
Pickman produced a flashlight and revealed an antediluvian ten-panelled door 3
that looked damnably worm-eaten. Unlocking it, he ushered me into a barren 3
hallway with what was once splendid dark-oak panelling- simple, of course, but 3
3
3
3
247 3
3
3
3
thrillingly suggestive of the times of Andros and Phipps and the Witchcraft. 3
Then he took me through a door on the left, Hghted an oil lamp, and told me to 3
make myself at home. 3
3
Now, Eliot, I'm what the man in the street would call fairly 'hard-boiled,' but I'll 3
confess that what I saw on the walls of that room gave me a bad turn. They were 3
his pictures, you know - the ones he couldn't paint or even show in Newbury 3
Street- and he was right when he said he had 'let himself go.' Here- have another 3
drink- I need one anyhow! 3
3
There's no use in my trying to tell you what they were like, because the awful, 3
the blasphemous horror, and the unbelievable loathsomeness and moral foetor 3
came from simple touches quite beyond the power of words to classify. There 3
was none of the exotic technique you see in Sidney Sime, none of the trans- 3
Saturnian landscapes and lunar fungi that Clark Ashton Smith uses to freeze the 3
blood. The backgrounds were mostly old churchyards, deep woods, cliffs by the 3
sea, brick tunnels, ancient panelled rooms, or simple vaults of masonry. Copp's 3
Hill Burying Ground, which could not be many blocks away from this very 3
house, was a favourite scene. 3
3
The madness and monstrosity lay in the figures in the foreground- for Pickman's 3
morbid art was pre-eminently one of demoniac portraiture. These figures were 3
seldom completely human, but often approached humanity in varying degree. 3
Most of the bodies, while roughly bipedal, had a forward slumping, and a 3
vaguely canine cast. The texture of the majority was a kind of unpleasant 3
rubberiness. Ugh! I can see them now! Their occupations - well, don't ask me to 3
be too precise. They were usually feeding- I won't say on what. They were 3
sometimes shown in groups in cemeteries or underground passages, and often 3
appeared to be in battle over their prey- or rather, their treasure-trove. And what 3
damnable expressiveness Pickman sometimes gave the sightless faces of this 3
charnel booty! Occasionally the things were shown leaping through open 3
windows at night, or squatting on the chests of sleepers, worrying at their 3
throats. One canvas showed a ring of them baying about a hanged witch on 3
Gallows Hill, whose dead face held a close kinship to theirs. 3
3
But don't get the idea that it was all this hideous business of theme and setting 3
which struck me faint. I'm not a three-year-old kid, and I'd seen much like this 3
before. It was the faces, Eliot, those accursed faces, that leered and slavered out 3
of the canvas with the very breath of life! By God, man, I verily believe they were 3
alive! That nauseous wizard had waked the fires of hell in pigment, and his 3
brush had been a nightmare-spawning wand. Give me that decanter, Eliot! 3
3
3
3
248 3
3
3
3
There was one thing called 'The Lesson'- Heaven pity me, that I ever saw it! 3
Listen- can you fancy a squatting circle of nameless dog-like things in a 3
churchyard teaching a small child how to feed like themselves? The price of a 3
changeling, I suppose- you know the old myth about how the weird people leave 3
their spawn in cradles in exchange for the human babes they steal. Pickman was 3
showing what happens to those stolen babes- how they grow up- and then I 3
began to see a hideous relationship in the faces of the human and non-human 3
figures. He was, in all his gradations of morbidity between the frankly non- 3
human and the degradedly human, establishing a sardonic linkage and 3
evolution. The dog- things were developed from mortals! 3
3
And no sooner had I wondered what he made of their own young as left with 3
mankind in the form of changelings, than my eye caught a picture embodying 3
that very thought. It was that of an ancient Puritan interior- a heavily beamed 3
room with lattice windows, a settle, and clumsy seventeenth-century furniture, 3
with the family sitting about while the father read from the Scriptures. Every face 3
but one showed nobility and reverence, but that one reflected the mockery of the 3
pit. It was that of a young man in years, and no doubt belonged to a supposed 3
son of that pious father, but in essence it was the kin of the unclean things. It was 3
their changeling- and in a spirit of supreme irony Pickman had given the features 3
a very perceptible resemblance to his own. 3
3
By this time Pickman had lighted a lamp in an adjoining room and was politely 3
holding open the door for me; asking me if I would care to see his 'modern 3
studies.' I hadn't been able to give him much of my opinions- I was too 3
speechless with fright and loathing- but I think he fully understood and felt 3
highly complimented. And now I want to assure you again, Eliot, that I'm no 3
mollycoddle to scream at anything which shows a bit of departure from the 3
usual. I'm middle-aged and decently sophisticated, and I guess you saw enough 3
of me in France to know I'm not easily knocked out. Remember, too, that I'd just 3
about recovered my wind and gotten used to those frightful pictures which 3
turned colonial New England into a kind of annex of hell. Well, in spite of all 3
this, that next room forced a real scream out of me, and I had to clutch at the 3
doorway to keep from keeling over. The other chamber had shown a pack of 3
ghouls and witches over-running the world of our forefathers, but this one 3
brought the horror right into our own daily life! 3
3
God, how that man could paint! There was a study called 'Subway Accident,' in 3
which a flock of the vile things were clambering up from some unknown 3
catacomb through a crack in the floor of the Boston Street subway and attacking 3
a crowd of people on the platform. Another showed a dance on Copp's Hill 3
among the tombs with the background of today. Then there were any number of 3
cellar views, with monsters creeping in through holes and rifts in the masonry 3
3
3
3
249 3
3
3
3
and grinning as they squatted behind barrels or furnaces and waited for their 3
first victim to descend the stairs. 3
3
One disgusting canvas seemed to depict a vast cross-section of Beacon Hill, with 3
ant-like armies of the mephitic monsters squeezing themselves through burrows 3
that honeycombed the ground. Dances in the modern cemeteries were freely 3
pictured, and another conception somehow shocked me more than all the rest- a 3
scene in an unknown vault, where scores of the beasts crowded about one who 3
had a well-known Boston guidebook and was evidently reading aloud. All were 3
pointing to a certain passage, and every face seemed so distorted with epileptic 3
and reverberant laughter that I almost thought I heard the fiendish echoes. The 3
title of the picture was, 'Holmes, Lowell and Longfellow Lie Buried in Mount 3
Auburn.' 3
3
As I gradually steadied myself and got readjusted to this second room of deviltry 3
and morbidity, I began to analyse some of the points in my sickening loathing. In 3
the first place, I said to myself, these things repelled because of the utter 3
inhumanity and callous crudity they showed in Pickman. The fellow must be a 3
relentless enemy of all mankind to take such glee in the torture of brain and flesh 3
and the degradation of the mortal tenement. In the second place, they terrified 3
because of their very greatness. Their art was the art that convinced- when we 3
saw the pictures we saw the demons themselves and were afraid of them. And 3
the queer part was, that Pickman got none of his power from the use of 3
selectiveness or bizarrerie. Nothing was blurred, distorted, or conventionalized; 3
outlines were sharp and lifelike, and details were almost painfully defined. And 3
the faces! 3
3
It was not any mere artist's interpretation that we saw; it was pandemonium 3
itself, crystal clear in stark objectivity. That was it, by Heaven! The man was not a 3
fantaisiste or romanticist at all- he did not even try to give us the churning, 3
prismatic ephemera of dreams, but coldly and sardonically reflected some stable, 3
mechanistic, and well-established horror- world which he saw fully, brilliantly, 3
squarely, and unfalteringly. God knows what that world can have been, or 3
where he ever glimpsed the blasphemous shapes that loped and trotted and 3
crawled through it; but whatever the baffling source of his images, one thing was 3
plain. Pickman was in every sense- in conception and in execution- a thorough, 3
painstaking, and almost scientific realist. 3
3
My host was now leading the way down the cellar to his actual studio, and I 3
braced myself for some hellish efforts among the unfinished canvases. As we 3
reached the bottom of the damp stairs he fumed his flash-light to a corner of the 3
large open space at hand, revealing the circular brick curb of what was evidently 3
a great well in the earthen floor. We walked nearer, and I saw that it must be five 3
3
3
3
250 3
3
3
3
feet across, with walls a good foot thick and some six inches above the ground 3
level- solid work of the seventeenth century, or I was much mistaken. That, 3
Pickman said, was the kind of thing he had been talking about- an aperture of 3
the network of tunnels that used to undermine the hill. I noticed idly that it did 3
not seem to be bricked up, and that a heavy disc of wood formed the apparent 3
cover. Thinking of the things this well must have been connected with if 3
Pickman's wild hints had not been mere rhetoric, I shivered slightly; then turned 3
to follow him up a step and through a narrow door into a room of fair size, 3
provided with a wooden floor and furnished as a studio. An acetylene gas outfit 3
gave the light necessary for work. 3
3
The unfinished pictures on easels or propped against the walls were as ghastly as 3
the finished ones upstairs, and showed the painstaking methods of the artist. 3
Scenes were blocked out with extreme care, and pencilled guide lines told of the 3
minute exactitude which Pickman used in getting the right perspective and 3
proportions. The man was great- I say it even now, knowing as much as I do. A 3
large camera on a table excited my notice, and Pickman told me that he used it in 3
taking scenes for backgrounds, so that he might paint them from photographs in 3
the studio instead of carting his oufit around the town for this or that view. He 3
thought a photograph quite as good as an actual scene or model for sustained 3
work, and declared he employed them regularly. 3
3
There was something very disturbing about the nauseous sketches and half- 3
finished monstrosities that leered round from every side of the room, and when 3
Pickman suddenly unveiled a huge canvas on the side away from the light I 3
could not for my life keep back a loud scream- the second I had emitted that 3
night. It echoed and echoed through the dim vaultings of that ancient and 3
nitrous cellar, and I had to choke back a flood of reaction that threatened to burst 3
out as hysterical laughter. Merciful Creator! Eliot, but I don't know how much 3
was real and how much was feverish fancy. It doesn't seem to me that earth can 3
hold a dream like that! 3
3
It was a colossal and nameless blasphemy with glaring red eyes, and it held in 3
bony claws a thing that had been a man, gnawing at the head as a child nibbles at 3
a stick of candy. Its position was a kind of crouch, and as one looked one felt that 3
at any moment it might drop its present prey and seek a juicier morsel. But damn 3
it all, it wasn't even the fiendish subject that made it such an immortal fountain- 3
head of all panic- not that, nor the dog face with its pointed ears, bloodshot eyes, 3
flat nose, and drooling lips. It wasn't the scaly claws nor the mould-caked body 3
nor the half-hooved feet- none of these, though any one of them might well have 3
driven an excitable man to madness. 3
3
3
3
251 3
3
3
3
It was the technique, Ehot- the cursed, the impious, the unnatural technique! As I 3
am a Hving being, I never elsewhere saw the actual breath of life so fused into a 3
canvas. The monster was there- it glared and gnawed and gnawed and glared- 3
and I knew that only a suspension of Nature's laws could ever let a man paint a 3
thing like that without a model- without some glimpse of the nether world which 3
no mortal unsold to the Fiend has ever had. 3
3
Pinned with a thumb-tack to a vacant part of the canvas was a piece of paper 3
now badly curled up- probably, I thought, a photograph from which Pickman 3
meant to paint a background as hideous as the nightmare it was to enhance. I 3
reached out to uncurl and look at it, when suddenly I saw Pickman start as if 3
shot. He had been listening with peculiar intensity ever since my shocked scream 3
had waked unaccustomed echoes in the dark cellar, and now he seemed struck 3
with a fright which, though not comparable to my own, had in it more of the 3
physical than of the spiritual. He drew a revolver and motioned me to silence, 3
then stepped out into the main cellar and closed the door behind him. 3
3
I think I was paralysed for an instant. Imitating Pickman's listening, I fancied I 3
heard a faint scurrying sound somewhere, and a series of squeals or beats in a 3
direction I couldn't determine. I thought of huge rats and shuddered. Then there 3
came a subdued sort of clatter which somehow set me all in gooseflesh- a furtive, 3
groping kind of clatter, though I can't attempt to convey what I mean in words. It 3
was like heavy wood falling on stone or brick- wood on brick- what did that 3
make me think of? 3
3
It came again, and louder. There was a vibration as if the wood had fallen farther 3
than it had fallen before. After that followed a sharp grating noise, a shouted 3
gibberish from Pickman, and the deafening discharge of all six chambers of a 3
revolver, fired spectacularly as a lion tamer might fire in the air for effect. A 3
muffled squeal or squawk, and a thud. Then more wood and brick grating, a 3
pause, and the opening of the door- at which I'll confess I started violently. 3
Pickman reappeared with his smoking weapon, cursing the bloated rats that 3
infested the ancient well. 3
3
'The deuce knows what they eat, Thurber,' he grinned, 'for those archaic tunnels 3
touched graveyard and witch-den and sea-coast. But whatever it is, they must 3
have run short, for they were devilish anxious to get out. Your yelling stirred 3
them up, I fancy. Better be cautious in these old places- our rodent friends are the 3
one drawback, though I sometimes think they're a positive asset by way of 3
atmosphere and colour.' 3
3
Well, Eliot, that was the end of the night's adventure. Pickman had promised to 3
show me the place, and Heaven knows he had done it. He led me out of that 3
3
3
3
252 3
3
3
3
tangle of alleys in another direction, it seems, for when we sighted a lamp-post 3
we were in a half-familiar street with monotonous rows of mingled tenement 3
blocks and old houses. Charter Street, it turned out to be, but I was too flustered 3
to notice just where we hit it. We were too late for the elevated, and walked back 3
downtown through Hanover Street. I remember that wall. We switched from 3
Tremont up Beacon, and Pickman left me at the corner of Joy, where I turned off. 3
I never spoke to him again. 3
3
Why did I drop him? Don't be impatient. Wait till I ring for coffee. We've had 3
enough of the other stuff, but I for one need something. No -it wasn't the 3
paintings I saw in that place; though I'll swear they were enough to get him 3
ostracised in nine-tenths of the homes and clubs of Boston, and I guess you won't 3
wonder now why I have to steer clear of subways and cellars. It was- something I 3
found in my coat the next morning. You know, the curled-up paper tacked to the 3
frightful canvas in the cellar; the thing I thought was a photograph of some scene 3
he meant to use as a background for that monster. That last scare had come while 3
I was reaching to uncurl it, and it seems I had vacantly crumpled it into my 3
pocket. But here's the coffee- take it black, Eliot, if you're wise. 3
3
Yes, that paper was the reason I dropped Pickman; Richard Upton Pickman, the 3
greatest artist I have ever known- and the foulest being that ever leaped the 3
bounds of life into the pits of myth and madness. Eliot- old Reid was right. He 3
wasn't strictly human. Either he was born in strange shadow, or he'd found a 3
way to unlock the forbidden gate. It's all the same now, for he's gone- back into 3
the fabulous darkness he loved to haunt. Here, let's have the chandelier going. 3
3
Don't ask me to explain or even conjecture about what I burned. Don't ask me, 3
either, what lay behind that mole-like scrambling Pickman was so keen to pass 3
off as rats. There are secrets, you know, which might have come down from old 3
Salem times, and Cotton Mather tells even stranger things. You know how 3
damned lifelike Pickman's paintings were- how we all wondered where he got 3
those faces. 3
3
Well - that paper wasn't a photograph of any background, after all. What it 3
showed was simply the monstrous being he was painting on that awful canvas. 3
It was the model he was using- and its background was merely the wall of the 3
cellar studio in minute detail. But by God, Eliot, it was a photograph from life! 3

3
Into the North Window of my chamber glows the Pole Star with uncanny light. 3
All through the long hellish hours of blackness it shines there. And in the 3
autumn of the year, when the winds from the north curse and whine, and the 3
red-leaved trees of the swamp mutter things to one another in the small hours of 3
the morning under the horned waning moon, I sit by the casement and watch 3
that star. Down from the heights reels the glittering Cassiopeia as the hours wear 3
on, while Charles' Wain lumbers up from behind the vapour-soaked swamp 3
trees that sway in the night wind. Just before dawn Arcturus winks ruddily from 3
above the cemetary on the low hillock, and Coma Berenices shimmers weirdly 3
afar off in the mysterious east; but still the Pole Star leers down from the same 3
place in the black vault, winking hideously like an insane watching eye which 3
strives to convey some strange message, yet recalls nothing save that it once had 3
a message to convey. Sometimes, when it is cloudy, I can sleep. 3
Well do I remember the night of the great Aurora, when over the swamp played 3
the shocking corruscations of the demon light. After the beam came clouds, and 3
then I slept. 3
3
And it was under a horned waning moon that I saw the city for the first time. 3
Still and somnolent did it lie, on a strange plateau in a hollow between strange 3
peaks. Of ghastly marble were its walls and its towers, its columns, domes, and 3
pavements. In the marble streets were marble pillars, the upper parts of which 3
were carven into the images of grave bearded men. The air was warm and stirred 3
not. And overhead, scarce ten degrees from the zenith, glowed that watching 3
Pole Star. Long did I gaze on the city, but the day came not. When the red 3
Aldebaran, which blinked low in the sky but never set, had crawled a quarter of 3
the way around the horizon, I saw light and motion in the houses and the streets. 3
Forms strangely robed, but at once noble and familiar, walked abroad and under 3
the horned waning moon men talked wisdom in a tongue which I understood, 3
though it was unlike any language which I had ever known. And when the red 3
Aldebaran had crawled more than half-way around the horizon, there were 3
again darkness and silence. 3
3
When I awaked, I was not as I had been. Upon my memory was graven the 3
vision of the city, and within my soul had arisen another and vaguer recollection, 3
of whose nature I was not then certain. Thereafter, on the cloudy nights when I 3
could not sleep, I saw the city often; sometimes under the hot, yellow rays of a 3
3
3
3
254 3
3
3
3
sun which did not set, but which wheeled low in the horizon. And on the clear 3
nights the Pole Star leered as never before. 3
3
Gradually I came to wonder what might be my place in that city on the strange 3
plateau betwixt strange peaks. At first content to view the scene as an all- 3
observant uncorporeal presence, I now desired to define my relation to it, and to 3
speak my mind amongst the grave men who conversed each day in the public 3
squares. I said to myself, "This is no dream, for by what means can I prove the 3
greater reality of that other life in the house of stone and brick south of the 3
sinister swamp and the cemetery on the low hillock, where the Pole Star peeps 3
into my north window each night?" 3
3
One night as I listened to the discourses in the large square containing many 3
statues, I felt a change; and perceived that I had at last a bodily form. Nor was I a 3
stranger in the streets of Olathoe, which lies on the plateau of Sarkia, betwixt the 3
peaks of Noton and Kadiphonek. It was my friend Alos who spoke, and his 3
speech was one that pleased my soul, for it was the speech of a true man and 3
patriot. That night had the news come of Daikos' fall, and of the advance of the 3
Inutos; squat, hellish yellow fiends who five years ago had appeared out of the 3
unknown west to ravage the confines of our kingdom, and to besiege many of 3
our towns. Having taken the fortified places at the foot of the mountains, their 3
way now lay open to the plateau, unless every citizen could resist with the 3
strength of ten men. For the squat creatures were mighty in the arts of war, and 3
knew not the scruples of honour which held back our tall, grey-eyed men of 3
Lomar from ruthless conquest. 3
3
Alos, my friend, was commander of all the forces on the plateau, and in him lay 3
the last hope of our country. On this occasion he spoke of the perils to be faced 3
and exhorted the men of Olathoe, bravest of the Lomarians, to sustain the 3
traditions of their ancestors, who when forced to move southward from Zobna 3
before the advance of the great ice sheet (even as our descendents must some day 3
flee from the land of Lomar) valiently and victoriously swept aside the hairly, 3
long-armed, cannibal Gnophkehs that stood in their way. To me Alos denied the 3
warriors part, for I was feeble and given to strange faintings when subjected to 3
stress and hardships. But my eyes were the keenest in the city, despite the long 3
hours I gave each day to the study of the Pnakotic manuscripts and the wisdom 3
of the Zobnarian Fathers; so my friend, desiring not to doom me to inaction, 3
rewarded me with that duty which was second to nothing in importance. To the 3
watchtower of Thapnen he sent me, there to serve as the eyes of our army. 3
Should the Inutos attempt to gain the citadel by the narrow pass behind the peak 3
Noton and thereby surprise the garrison, I was to give the signal of fire which 3
would warn the waiting soldiers and save the town from immediate disaster. 3
3
3
3
255 3
3
3
3
Alone I mounted the tower, for every man of stout body was needed in the 3
passes below. My brain was sore dazed with excitement and fatigue, for I had 3
not slept in many days; yet was my purpose firm, for I loved my native land of 3
Lomar, and the marble city Olathoe that lies betwixt the peaks Noton and 3
Kadiphonek. 3
3
But as I stood in the tower's topmost chamber, I beheld the horned waning 3
moon, red and sinister, quivering through the vapours that hovered over the 3
distant valley of Banof. And through an opening in the roof glittered the pale 3
Pole Star, fluttering as if alive, and leering like a fiend and tempter. Methought 3
its spirit whispered evil counsel, soothing me to traitorous somnolence with a 3
damnable rhythmical promise which it repeated over and over: 3

Vainly did I struggle with my drowsiness, seeking to connect these strange 3
words with some lore of the skies which I had learnt from the Pnakotic 3
manuscripts. My head, heavy and reeling, drooped to my breast, and when next 3
I looked up it was in a dream, with the Pole Star grinning at me through a 3
window from over the horrible and swaying trees of a dream swamp. And I am 3
still dreaming. 3
3
In my shame and despair I sometimes scream frantically, begging the dream- 3
creatures around me to waken me ere the Inutos steal up the pass behind the 3
peak Noton and take the citadel by surprise; but these creatures are demons, for 3
they laugh at me and tell me I am not dreaming. They mock me whilst I sleep, 3
and whilst the squat yellow foe may be creeping silently upon us. I have failed in 3
my duties and betrayed the marble city of Olathoe; I have proven false to Alos, 3
my friend and commander. But still these shadows of my dreams deride me. 3
They say there is no land of Lomar, save in my nocturnal imaginings; that in 3
these realms where the Pole Star shines high, and red Aldebaran crawls low 3
around the horizon, there has been naught save ice and snow for thousands of 3
years of years, and never a man save squat, yellow creatures, blighted by the 3
cold, called "Esquimaux." 3

3
And as I writhe in my guilty agony, frantic to save the city whose peril every 3
moment grows, and vainly striving to shake off this unnatural dream of a house 3
of stone and brick south of a sinister swamp and a cemetery on a low hillock, the 3
Pole Star, evil and monstrous, leers down from the black vault, winking 3
hideously like an insane watching eye which strives to convey some message, yet 3
recalls nothing save that it once had a message to convey. 3

3
High up, crowning the grassy summit of a swelHng mount whose sides are 3
wooded near the base with the gnarled trees of the primeval forest stands the old 3
chateau of my ancestors. For centuries its lofty battlements have frowned down 3
upon the wild and rugged countryside about, serving as a home and stronghold 3
for the proud house whose honored line is older even than the moss-grown 3
castle walls. These ancient turrets, stained by the storms of generations and 3
crumbling under the slow yet mighty pressure of time, formed in the ages of 3
feudalism one of the most dreaded and formidable fortresses in all France. From 3
its machicolated parapets and mounted battlements Barons, Counts, and even 3
Kings had been defied, yet never had its spacious halls resounded to the 3
footsteps of the invader. 3
3
But since those glorious years, all is changed. A poverty but little above the level 3
of dire want, together with a pride of name that forbids its alleviation by the 3
pursuits of commercial life, have prevented the scions of our line from 3
maintaining their estates in pristine splendour; and the falling stones of the 3
walls, the overgrown vegetation in the parks, the dry and dusty moat, the ill- 3
paved courtyards, and toppling towers without, as well as the sagging floors, the 3
worm-eaten wainscots, and the faded tapestries within, all tell a gloomy tale of 3
fallen grandeur. As the ages passed, first one, then another of the four great 3
turrets were left to ruin, until at last but a single tower housed the sadly reduced 3
descendants of the once mighty lords of the estate. 3
3
It was in one of the vast and gloomy chambers of this remaining tower that I, 3
Antoine, last of the unhappy and accursed Counts de C-, first saw the light of 3
day, ninety long years ago. Within these walls and amongst the dark and 3
shadowy forests, the wild ravines and grottos of the hillside below, were spent 3
the first years of my troubled life. My parents I never knew. My father had been 3
killed at the age of thirty-two, a month before I was born, by the fall of a stone 3
somehow dislodged from one of the deserted parapets of the castle. And my 3
mother having died at my birth, my care and education devolved solely upon 3
one remaining servitor, an old and trusted man of considerable intelligence, 3
whose name I remember as Pierre. I was an only child and the lack of 3
companionship which this fact entailed upon me was augmented by the strange 3
care exercised by my aged guardian, in excluding me from the society of the 3
peasant children whose abodes were scattered here and there upon the plains 3
3
3
3
258 3
3
3
3
that surround the base of the hill. At that time, Pierre said that this restriction 3
was imposed upon me because my noble birth placed me above association with 3
such plebeian company. Now I know that its real object was to keep from my 3
ears the idle tales of the dread curse upon our line that were nightly told and 3
magnified by the simple tenantry as they conversed in hushed accents in the 3
glow of their cottage hearths. 3
3
Thus isolated, and thrown upon my own resources, I spent the hours of my 3
childhood in poring over the ancient tomes that filled the shadow haunted 3
library of the chateau, and in roaming without aim or purpose through the 3
perpetual dust of the spectral wood that clothes the side of the hill near its foot. It 3
was perhaps an effect of such surroundings that my mind early acquired a shade 3
of melancholy. Those studies and pursuits which partake of the dark and occult 3
in nature most strongly claimed my attention. 3
3
Of my own race I was permitted to learn singularly little, yet what small 3
knowledge of it I was able to gain seemed to depress me much. Perhaps it was at 3
first only the manifest reluctance of my old preceptor to discuss with me my 3
paternal ancestry that gave rise to the terror which I ever felt at the mention of 3
my great house, yet as I grew out of childhood, I was able to piece together 3
disconnected fragments of discourse, let slip from the unwilling tongue which 3
had begun to falter in approaching senility, that had a sort of relation to a certain 3
circumstance which I had always deemed strange, but which now became dimly 3
terrible. The circumstance to which I allude is the early age at which all the 3
Counts of my line had met their end. Whilst I had hitherto considered this but a 3
natural attribute of a family of short-lived men, I afterward pondered long upon 3
these premature deaths, and began to connect them with the wanderings of the 3
old man, who often spoke of a curse which for centuries had prevented the lives 3
of the holders of my title from much exceeding the span of thirty-two years. 3
Upon my twenty-first birthday, the aged Pierre gave to me a family document 3
which he said had for many generations been handed down from father to son, 3
and continued by each possessor. Its contents were of the most startling nature, 3
and its perusal confirmed the gravest of my apprehensions. At this time, my 3
belief in the supernatural was firm and deep-seated, else I should have dismissed 3
with scorn the incredible narrative unfolded before my eyes. 3
3
The paper carried me back to the days of the thirteenth century, when the old 3
castle in which I sat had been a feared and impregnable fortress. It told of a 3
certain ancient man who had once dwelled on our estates, a person of no small 3
accomplishments, though little above the rank of peasant, by name, Michel, 3
usually designated by the surname of Mauvais, the Evil, on account of his 3
sinister reputation. He had studied beyond the custom of his kind, seeking such 3
things as the Philosopher's Stone or the Elixir of Eternal Life, and was reputed 3
3
3
3
259 3
3
3
3
wise in the terrible secrets of Black Magic and Alchemy. Michel Mauvais had one 3
son, named Charles, a youth as proficient as himself in the hidden arts, who had 3
therefore been called Le Sorcier, or the Wizard. This pair, shunned by all honest 3
folk, were suspected of the most hideous practices. Old Michel was said to have 3
burnt his wife alive as a sacrifice to the Devil, and the unaccountable 3
disappearance of many small peasant children was laid at the dreaded door of 3
these two. Yet through the dark natures of the father and son ran one redeeming 3
ray of humanity; the evil old man loved his offspring with fierce intensity, whilst 3
the youth had for his parent a more than filial affection. 3
3
One night the castle on the hill was thrown into the wildest confusion by the 3
vanishment of young Godfrey, son to Henri, the Count. A searching party, 3
headed by the frantic father, invaded the cottage of the sorcerers and there came 3
upon old Michel Mauvais, busy over a huge and violently boiling cauldron. 3
Without certain cause, in the ungoverned madness of fury and despair, the 3
Count laid hands on the aged wizard, and ere he released his murderous hold, 3
his victim was no more. Meanwhile, joyful servants were proclaiming the finding 3
of young Godfrey in a distant and unused chamber of the great edifice, telling 3
too late that poor Michel had been killed in vain. As the Count and his associates 3
turned away from the lowly abode of the alchemist, the form of Charles Le 3
Sorcier appeared through the trees. The excited chatter of the menials standing 3
about told him what had occurred, yet he seemed at first unmoved at his father's 3
fate. Then, slowly advancing to meet the Count, he pronounced in dull yet 3
terrible accents the curse that ever afterward haunted the house of C-. 3
3
'May ne'er a noble of thy murd'rous line 3
3
Survive to reach a greater age than thine!' 3
3
spake he, when, suddenly leaping backwards into the black woods, he drew 3
from his tunic a phial of colourless liquid which he threw into the face of his 3
father's slayer as he disappeared behind the inky curtain of the night. The Count 3
died without utterance, and was buried the next day, but little more than two 3
and thirty years from the hour of his birth. No trace of the assassin could be 3
found, though relentless bands of peasants scoured the neighboring woods and 3
the meadowland around the hill. 3
3
Thus time and the want of a reminder dulled the memory of the curse in the 3
minds of the late Count's family, so that when Godfrey, innocent cause of the 3
whole tragedy and now bearing the title, was killed by an arrow whilst hunting 3
at the age of thirty-two, there were no thoughts save those of grief at his demise. 3
But when, years afterward, the next young Count, Robert by name, was found 3
dead in a nearby field of no apparent cause, the peasants told in whispers that 3
their seigneur had but lately passed his thirty-second birthday when surprised 3
3
3
3
260 3
3
3
3
by early death. Louis, son to Robert, was found drowned in the moat at the same 3
fateful age, and thus down through the centuries ran the ominous chronicle: 3
Henris, Roberts, Antoines, and Armands snatched from happy and virtuous lives 3
when little below the age of their unfortunate ancestor at his murder. 3
3
That I had left at most but eleven years of further existence was made certain to 3
me by the words which I had read. My life, previously held at small value, now 3
became dearer to me each day, as I delved deeper and deeper into the mysteries 3
of the hidden world of black magic. Isolated as I was, modern science had 3
produced no impression upon me, and I laboured as in the Middle Ages, as 3
wrapt as had been old Michel and young Charles themselves in the acquisition of 3
demonological and alchemical learning. Yet read as I might, in no manner could I 3
account for the strange curse upon my line. In unusually rational moments I 3
would even go so far as to seek a natural explanation, attributing the early deaths 3
of my ancestors to the sinister Charles Le Sorcier and his heirs; yet, having found 3
upon careful inquiry that there were no known descendants of the alchemist, I 3
would fall back to occult studies, and once more endeavor to find a spell, that 3
would release my house from its terrible burden. Upon one thing I was 3
absolutely resolved. I should never wed, for, since no other branch of my family 3
was in existence, I might thus end the curse with myself. 3
3
As I drew near the age of thirty, old Pierre was called to the land beyond. Alone I 3
buried him beneath the stones of the courtyard about which he had loved to 3
wander in life. Thus was I left to ponder on myself as the only human creature 3
within the great fortress, and in my utter solitude my mind began to cease its 3
vain protest against the impending doom, to become almost reconciled to the fate 3
which so many of my ancestors had met. Much of my time was now occupied in 3
the exploration of the ruined and abandoned halls and towers of the old chateau, 3
which in youth fear had caused me to shun, and some of which old Pierre had 3
once told me had not been trodden by human foot for over four centuries. 3
Strange and awesome were many of the objects I encountered. Furniture, 3
covered by the dust of ages and crumbling with the rot of long dampness, met 3
my eyes. Cobwebs in a profusion never before seen by me were spun 3
everywhere, and huge bats flapped their bony and uncanny wings on all sides of 3
the otherwise untenanted gloom. 3
3
Of my exact age, even down to days and hours, I kept a most careful record, for 3
each movement of the pendulum of the massive clock in the library told off so 3
much of my doomed existence. At length I approached that time which I had so 3
long viewed with apprehension. Since most of my ancestors had been seized 3
some little while before they reached the exact age of Count Henri at his end, I 3
was every moment on the watch for the coming of the unknown death. In what 3
strange form the curse should overtake me, I knew not; but I was resolved at 3
3
3
3
261 3
3
3
3
least that it should not find me a cowardly or a passive victim. With new vigour I 3
applied myself to my examination of the old chateau and its contents. 3
3
It was upon one of the longest of all my excursions of discovery in the deserted 3
portion of the castle, less than a week before that fatal hour which I felt must 3
mark the utmost limit of my stay on earth, beyond which I could have not even 3
the slightest hope of continuing to draw breath that I came upon the culminating 3
event of my whole life. I had spent the better part of the morning in climbing up 3
and down half ruined staircases in one of the most dilapidated of the ancient 3
turrets. As the afternoon progressed, I sought the lower levels, descending into 3
what appeared to be either a mediaeval place of confinement, or a more recently 3
excavated storehouse for gunpowder. As I slowly traversed the nitre-encrusted 3
passageway at the foot of the last staircase, the paving became very damp, and 3
soon I saw by the light of my flickering torch that a blank, water-stained wall 3
impeded my journey. Turning to retrace my steps, my eye fell upon a small 3
trapdoor with a ring, which lay directly beneath my foot. Pausing, I succeeded 3
with difficulty in raising it, whereupon there was revealed a black aperture, 3
exhaling noxious fumes which caused my torch to sputter, and disclosing in the 3
unsteady glare the top of a flight of stone steps. 3
3
As soon as the torch which I lowered into the repellent depths burned freely and 3
steadily, I commenced my descent. The steps were many, and led to a narrow 3
stone-flagged passage which I knew must be far underground. This passage 3
proved of great length, and terminated in a massive oaken door, dripping with 3
the moisture of the place, and stoutly resisting all my attempts to open it. 3
Ceasing after a time my efforts in this direction, I had proceeded back some 3
distance toward the steps when there suddenly fell to my experience one of the 3
most profound and maddening shocks capable of reception by the human mind. 3
Without warning, I heard the heavy door behind me creak slowly open upon its 3
rusted hinges. My immediate sensations were incapable of analysis. To be 3
confronted in a place as thoroughly deserted as I had deemed the old castle with 3
evidence of the presence of man or spirit produced in my brain a horror of the 3
most acute description. When at last I turned and faced the seat of the sound, my 3
eyes must have started from their orbits at the sight that they beheld. 3
3
There in the ancient Gothic doorway stood a human figure. It was that of a man 3
clad in a skull-cap and long mediaeval tunic of dark colour. His long hair and 3
flowing beard were of a terrible and intense black hue, and of incredible 3
profusion. His forehead, high beyond the usual dimensions; his cheeks, deep- 3
sunken and heavily lined with wrinkles; and his hands, long, claw-like, and 3
gnarled, were of such a deadly marble-like whiteness as I have never elsewhere 3
seen in man. His figure, lean to the proportions of a skeleton, was strangely bent 3
and almost lost within the voluminous folds of his peculiar garment. But 3
3
3
3
262 3
3
3
3
strangest of all were his eyes, twin caves of abysmal blackness, profound in 3
expression of understanding, yet inhuman in degree of wickedness. These were 3
now fixed upon me, piercing my soul with their hatred, and rooting me to the 3
spot whereon I stood. 3
3
At last the figure spoke in a rumbling voice that chilled me through with its dull 3
hoUowness and latent malevolence. The language in which the discourse was 3
clothed was that debased form of Latin in use amongst the more learned men of 3
the Middle Ages, and made familiar to me by my prolonged researches into the 3
works of the old alchemists and demonologists. The apparition spoke of the 3
curse which had hovered over my house, told me of my coming end, dwelt on 3
the wrong perpetrated by my ancestor against old Michel Mauvais, and gloated 3
over the revenge of Charles Le Sorcier. He told how young Charles has escaped 3
into the night, returning in after years to kill Godfrey the heir with an arrow just 3
as he approached the age which had been his father's at his assassination; how 3
he had secretly returned to the estate and established himself, unknown, in the 3
even then deserted subterranean chamber whose doorway now framed the 3
hideous narrator, how he had seized Robert, son of Godfrey, in a field, forced 3
poison down his throat, and left him to die at the age of thirty-two, thus 3
maintaing the foul provisions of his vengeful curse. At this point I was left to 3
imagine the solution of the greatest mystery of all, how the curse had been 3
fulfilled since that time when Charles Le Sorcier must in the course of nature 3
have died, for the man digressed into an account of the deep alchemical studies 3
of the two wizards, father and son, speaking most particularly of the researches 3
of Charles Le Sorcier concerning the elixir which should grant to him who 3
partook of it eternal life and youth. 3
3
His enthusiasm had seemed for the moment to remove from his terrible eyes the 3
black malevolence that had first so haunted me, but suddenly the fiendish glare 3
returned and, with a shocking sound like the hissing of a serpent, the stranger 3
raised a glass phial with the evident intent of ending my life as had Charles Le 3
Sorcier, six hundred years before, ended that of my ancestor. Prompted by some 3
preserving instinct of self-defense, I broke through the spell that had hitherto 3
held me immovable, and flung my now dying torch at the creature who menaced 3
my existence. I heard the phial break harmlessly against the stones of the passage 3
as the tunic of the strange man caught fire and lit the horrid scene with a ghastly 3
radiance. The shriek of fright and impotent malice emitted by the would-be 3
assassin proved too much for my already shaken nerves, and I fell prone upon 3
the slimy floor in a total faint. 3
3
When at last my senses returned, all was frightfully dark, and my mind, 3
remembering what had occurred, shrank from the idea of beholding any more; 3
yet curiosity over-mastered all. Who, I asked myself, was this man of evil, and 3
3
3
3
263 3
3
3
3
how came he within the castle walls? Why should he seek to avenge the death of 3
Michel Mauvais, and how bad the curse been carried on through all the long 3
centuries since the time of Charles Le Sorcier? The dread of years was lifted from 3
my shoulder, for I knew that he whom I had felled was the source of all my 3
danger from the curse; and now that I was free, I burned with the desire to learn 3
more of the sinister thing which had haunted my line for centuries, and made of 3
my own youth one long-continued nightmare. Determined upon further 3
exploration, I felt in my pockets for flint and steel, and lit the unused torch which 3
I had with me. 3
3
First of all, new light revealed the distorted and blackened form of the 3
mysterious stranger. The hideous eyes were now closed. Disliking the sight, I 3
turned away and entered the chamber beyond the Gothic door. Here I found 3
what seemed much like an alchemist's laboratory. In one corner was an immense 3
pile of shining yellow metal that sparkled gorgeously in the light of the torch. It 3
may have been gold, but I did not pause to examine it, for I was strangely 3
affected by that which I had undergone. At the farther end of the apartment was 3
an opening leading out into one of the many wild ravines of the dark hillside 3
forest. Filled with wonder, yet now realizing how the man had obtained access to 3
the chauteau, I proceeded to return. I had intended to pass by the remains of the 3
stranger with averted face but, as I approached the body, I seemed to hear 3
emanating from it a faint sound, as though life were not yet wholly extinct. 3
Aghast, I turned to examine the charred and shrivelled figure on the floor. 3
3
Then all at once the horrible eyes, blacker even than the seared face in which they 3
were set, opened wide with an expression which I was unable to interpret. The 3
cracked lips tried to frame words which I could not well understand. Once I 3
caught the name of Charles Le Sorcier, and again I fancied that the words 'years' 3
and 'curse' issued from the twisted mouth. Still I was at a loss to gather the 3
purport of his disconnnected speech. At my evident ignorance of his meaning, 3
the pitchy eyes once more flashed malevolently at me, until, helpless as I saw my 3
opponent to be, I trembled as I watched him. 3
3
Suddenly the wretch, animated with his last burst of strength, raised his piteous 3
head from the damp and sunken pavement. Then, as I remained, paralyzed with 3
fear, he found his voice and in his dying breath screamed forth those words 3
which have ever afterward haunted my days and nights. 'Fool!' he shrieked, 3
'Can you not guess my secret? Have you no brain whereby you may recognize 3
the will which has through six long centuries fulfilled the dreadful curse upon 3
the house? Have I not told you of the great elixir of eternal life? Know you not 3
how the secret of Alchemy was solved? I tell you, it is I! I! I! that have lived for 3
six hundred years to maintain my revenge, for I am Charles Le Sorcier!' 3

The Beast in the Cave 3

3
The horrible conclusion which had been gradually intruding itself upon my 3
confused and reluctant mind was now an awful certainty. I was lost, completely, 3
hopelessly lost in the vast and labyrinthine recess of the Mammoth Cave. Turn as 3
I might, in no direction could my straining vision seize on any object capable of 3
serving as a guidepost to set me on the outward path. That nevermore should I 3
behold the blessed light of day, or scan the pleasant bills and dales of the 3
beautiful world outside, my reason could no longer entertain the slightest 3
unbelief. Hope had departed. Yet, indoctrinated as I was by a life of 3
philosophical study, I derived no small measure of satisfaction from my 3
unimpassioned demeanour; for although I had frequently read of the wild 3
frenzies into which were thrown the victims of similar situations, I experienced 3
none of these, but stood quiet as soon as I clearly realised the loss of my bearings. 3
3
Nor did the thought that I had probably wandered beyond the utmost limits of 3
an ordinary search cause me to abandon my composure even for a moment. If I 3
must die, I reflected, then was this terrible yet majestic cavern as welcome a 3
sepulchre as that which any churchyard might afford, a conception which carried 3
with it more of tranquillity than of despair. 3
3
Starving would prove my ultimate fate; of this I was certain. Some, I knew, had 3
gone mad under circumstances such as these, but I felt that this end would not be 3
mine. My disaster was the result of no fault save my own, since unknown to the 3
guide I had separated myself from the regular party of sightseers; and, 3
wandering for over an hour in forbidden avenues of the cave, had found myself 3
unable to retrace the devious windings which I had pursued since forsaking my 3
companions. 3
3
Already my torch had begun to expire; soon I would be enveloped by the total 3
and almost palpable blackness of the bowels of the earth. As I stood in the 3
waning, unsteady light, I idly wondered over the exact circumstances of my 3
coming end. I remembered the accounts which I had heard of the colony of 3
consumptives, who, taking their residence in this gigantic grotto to find health 3
from the apparently salubrious air of the underground world, with its steady, 3
uniform temperature, pure air, and peaceful quiet, had found, instead, death in 3
strange and ghastly form. I had seen the sad remains of their ill-made cottages as 3
I passed them by with the party, and had wondered what unnatural influence a 3
3
3
3
265 3
3
3
3
long sojourn in this immense and silent cavern would exert upon one as healthy 3
and vigorous as I. Now, I grimly told myself, my opportunity for settling this 3
point had arrived, provided that want of food should not bring me too speedy a 3
departure from this life. 3
3
As the last fitful rays of my torch faded into obscurity, I resolved to leave no 3
stone unturned, no possible means of escape neglected; so, summoning all the 3
powers possessed by my lungs, I set up a series of loud shoutings, in the vain 3
hope of attracting the attention of the guide by my clamour. Yet, as I called, I 3
believed in my heart that my cries were to no purpose, and that my voice, 3
magnified and reflected by the numberless ramparts of the black maze about me, 3
fell upon no ears save my own. 3
3
All at once, however, my attention was fixed with a start as I fancied that I heard 3
the sound of soft approaching steps on the rocky floor of the cavern. 3
3
Was my deliverance about to be accomplished so soon? Had, then, all my 3
horrible apprehensions been for naught, and was the guide, having marked my 3
unwarranted absence from the party, following my course and seeking me out in 3
this limestone labyrinth? Whilst these joyful queries arose in my brain, I was on 3
the point of renewing my cries, in order that my discovery might come the 3
sooner, when in an instant my delight was turned to horror as I listened; for my 3
ever acute ear, now sharpened in even greater degree by the complete silence of 3
the cave, bore to my benumbed understanding the unexpected and dreadful 3
knowledge that these footfalls were not like those of any mortal man. In the 3
unearthly stillness of this subterranean region, the tread of the booted guide 3
would have sounded like a series of sharp and incisive blows. These impacts 3
were soft, and stealthy, as of the paws of some feline. Besides, when I listened 3
carefully, I seemed to trace the falls of four instead of two feet. 3
3
I was now convinced that I had by my own cries aroused and attracted some 3
wild beast, perhaps a mountain lion which had accidentally strayed within the 3
cave. Perhaps, I considered, the Almighty had chosen for me a swifter and more 3
merciful death than that of hunger; yet the instinct of self-preservation, never 3
wholly dormant, was stirred in my breast, and though escape from the on- 3
coming peril might but spare me for a sterner and more lingering end, I 3
determined nevertheless to part with my life at as high a price as I could 3
command. Strange as it may seem, my mind conceived of no intent on the part of 3
the visitor save that of hostility. Accordingly, I became very quiet, in the hope 3
that the unknown beast would, in the absence of a guiding sound, lose its 3
direction as had I, and thus pass me by. But this hope was not destined for 3
realisation, for the strange footfalls steadily advanced, the animal evidently 3
having obtained my scent, which in an atmosphere so absolutely free from all 3
3
3
3
266 3
3
3
3
distracting influences as is that of the cave, could doubtless be followed at great 3
distance. 3
3
Seeing therefore that I must be armed for defense against an uncanny and unseen 3
attack in the dark, I groped about me the largest of the fragments of rock which 3
were strewn upon all parts of the floor of the cavern in the vicinity, and grasping 3
one in each hand for immediate use, awaited with resignation the inevitable 3
result. Meanwhile the hideous pattering of the paws drew near. Certainly, the 3
conduct of the creature was exceedingly strange. Most of the time, the tread 3
seemed to be that of a quadruped, walking with a singular lack of unison betwixt 3
hind and fore feet, yet at brief and infrequent intervals I fancied that but two feet 3
were engaged in the process of locomotion. I wondered what species of animal 3
was to confront me; it must, I thought, be some unfortunate beast who had paid 3
for its curiosity to investigate one of the entrances of the fearful grotto with a life- 3
long confinement in its interminable recesses. It doubtless obtained as food the 3
eyeless fish, bats and rats of the cave, as well as some of the ordinary fish that are 3
wafted in at every freshet of Green River, which communicates in some occult 3
manner with the waters of the cave. I occupied my terrible vigil with grotesque 3
conjectures of what alteration cave life might have wrought in the physical 3
structure of the beast, remembering the awful appearances ascribed by local 3
tradition to the consumptives who had died after long residence in the cave. 3
Then I remembered with a start that, even should I succeed in felling my 3
antagonist, I should never behold its form, as my torch had long since been 3
extinct, and I was entirely unprovided with matches. The tension on my brain 3
now became frightful. My disordered fancy conjured up hideous and fearsome 3
shapes from the sinister darkness that surrounded me, and that actually seemed 3
to press upon my body. Nearer, nearer, the dreadful footfalls approached. It 3
seemed that I must give vent to a piercing scream, yet had I been sufficiently 3
irresolute to attempt such a thing, my voice could scarce have responded. I was 3
petrified, rooted to the spot. I doubted if my right arm would allow me to hurl its 3
missile at the oncoming thing when the crucial moment should arrive. Now the 3
steady pat, pat, of the steps was close at hand; now very close. I could hear the 3
laboured breathing of the animal, and terror-struck as I was, I realised that it 3
must have come from a considerable distance, and was correspondingly 3
fatigued. Suddenly the spell broke. My right hand, guided by my ever 3
trustworthy sense of hearing, threw with full force the sharp-angled bit of 3
limestone which it contained, toward that point in the darkness from which 3
emanated the breathing and pattering, and, wonderful to relate, it nearly reached 3
its goal, for I heard the thing jump, landing at a distance away, where it seemed 3
to pause. 3
3
Having readjusted my aim, I discharged my second missile, this time most 3
effectively, for with a flood of joy I listened as the creature fell in what sounded 3
3
3
3
267 3
3
3
3
like a complete collapse and evidently remained prone and unmoving. Almost 3
overpowered by the great relief which rushed over me, I reeled back against the 3
wall. The breathing continued, in heavy, gasping inhalations and expirations, 3
whence I realised that I had no more than wounded the creature. And now all 3
desire to examine the thing ceased. At last something allied to groundless, 3
superstitious fear had entered my brain, and I did not approach the body, nor 3
did I continue to cast stones at it in order to complete the extinction of its life. 3
Instead, I ran at full speed in what was, as nearly as I could estimate in my 3
frenzied condition, the direction from which I had come. Suddenly I heard a 3
sound or rather, a regular succession of sounds. In another Instant they had 3
resolved themselves into a series of sharp, metallic clicks. This time there was no 3
doubt. It was the guide. And then I shouted, yelled, screamed, even shrieked 3
with joy as I beheld in the vaulted arches above the faint and glimmering 3
effulgence which I knew to be the reflected light of an approaching torch. I ran to 3
meet the flare, and before I could completely understand what had occurred, was 3
lying upon the ground at the feet of the guide, embracing his boots and 3
gibbering, despite my boasted reserve, in a most meaningless and idiotic 3
manner, pouring out my terrible story, and at the same time overwhelming my 3
auditor with protestations of gratitude. At length, I awoke to something like my 3
normal consciousness. The guide had noted my absence upon the arrival of the 3
party at the entrance of the cave, and had, from his own intuitive sense of 3
direction, proceeded to make a thorough canvass of by-passages just ahead of 3
where he had last spoken to me, locating my whereabouts after a quest of about 3
four hours. 3
3
By the time he had related this to me, I, emboldened by his torch and his 3
company, began to reflect upon the strange beast which I had wounded but a 3
short distance back in the darkness, and suggested that we ascertain, by the 3
flashlight's aid, what manner of creature was my victim. Accordingly I retraced 3
my steps, this time with a courage born of companionship, to the scene of my 3
terrible experience. Soon we descried a white object upon the floor, an object 3
whiter even than the gleaming limestone itself. Cautiously advancing, we gave 3
vent to a simultaneous ejaculation of wonderment, for of all the unnatural 3
monsters either of us had in our lifetimes beheld, this was in surpassing degree 3
the strangest. It appeared to be an anthropoid ape of large proportions, escaped, 3
perhaps, from some itinerant menagerie. Its hair was snow-white, a thing due no 3
doubt to the bleaching action of a long existence within the inky confines of the 3
cave, but it was also surprisingly thin, being indeed largely absent save on the 3
head, where it was of such length and abundance that it fell over the shoulders in 3
considerable profusion. The face was turned away from us, as the creature lay 3
almost directly upon it. The inclination of the limbs was very singular, 3
explaining, however, the alternation in their use which I bad before noted, 3
whereby the beast used sometimes all four, and on other occasions but two for its 3
3
3
3
268 3
3
3
3
progress. From the tips of the fingers or toes, long rat-Hke claws extended. The 3
hands or feet were not prehensile, a fact that I ascribed to that long residence in 3
the cave which, as I before mentioned, seemed evident from the all-pervading 3
and almost unearthly whiteness so characteristic of the whole anatomy. No tail 3
seemed to be present. 3
3
The respiration had now grown very feeble, and the guide had drawn his pistol 3
with the evident intent of despatching the creature, when a sudden sound 3
emitted by the latter caused the weapon to fall unused. The sound was of a 3
nature difficult to describe. It was not like the normal note of any known species 3
of simian, and I wonder if this unnatural quality were not the result of a long 3
continued and complete silence, broken by the sensations produced by the 3
advent of the light, a thing which the beast could not have seen since its first 3
entrance into the cave. The sound, which I might feebly attempt to classify as a 3
kind of deep-tone chattering, was faintly continued. 3
3
All at once a fleeting spasm of energy seemed to pass through the frame of the 3
beast. The paws went through a convulsive motion, and the limbs contracted. 3
With a jerk, the white body rolled over so that its face was turned in our 3
direction. For a moment I was so struck with horror at the eyes thus revealed that 3
I noted nothing else. They were black, those eyes, deep jetty black, in hideous 3
contrast to the snow-white hair and flesh. Like those of other cave denizens, they 3
were deeply sunken in their orbits, and were entirely destitute of iris. As I looked 3
more closely, I saw that they were set in a face less prognathous than that of the 3
average ape, and infinitely less hairy. The nose was quite distinct. As we gazed 3
upon the uncanny sight presented to our vision, the thick lips opened, and 3
several sounds issued from them, after which the thing relaxed in death. 3
3
The guide clutched my coat sleeve and trembled so violently that the light shook 3
fitfully, casting weird moving shadows on the walls. 3
3
I made no motion, but stood rigidly still, my horrified eyes fixed upon the floor 3
ahead. 3
3
The fear left, and wonder, awe, compassion, and reverence succeeded in its 3
place, for the sounds uttered by the stricken figure that lay stretched out on the 3
limestone had told us the awesome truth. The creature I had killed, the strange 3
beast of the unfathomed cave, was, or had at one time been a MAN!!! 3

The Book 3
3
Written in 1934 3
3
My memories are very confused. There is even much doubt as to where they 3
begin; for at times I feel appaUing vistas of years stretching behind me, while at 3
other times it seems as if the present moment were an isolated point in a grey, 3
formless infinity. I am not even certain how I am communicating this message. 3
While I know I am speaking, I have a vague impression that some strange and 3
perhaps terrible mediation will be needed to bear what I say to the points where 3
I wish to be heard. My identity, too, is bewilderingly cloudy. I seem to have 3
suffered a great shock- perhaps from some utterly monstrous outgrowth of my 3
cycles of unique, incredible experience. 3
3
These cycles of experience, of course, all stem from that worm-riddled book. I 3
remember when I found it- in a dimly lighted place near the black, oily river 3
where the mists always swirl. That place was very old, and the ceiling-high 3
shelves full of rotting volumes reached back endlessly through windowless inner 3
rooms and alcoves. There were, besides, great formless heaps of books on the 3
floor and in crude bins; and it was in one of these heaps that I found the thing. I 3
never learned its title, for the early pages were missing; but it fell open toward 3
the end and gave me a glimpse of something which sent my senses reeling. 3
3
There was a formula- a sort of list of things to say and do- which I recognized as 3
something black and forbidden; something which I had read of before in furtive 3
paragraphs of mixed abhorrence and fascination penned by those strange ancient 3
delvers into the universe's guarded secrets whose decaying texts I loved to 3
absorb. It was a key- a guide- to certain gateways and transitions of which 3
mystics have dreamed and whispered since the race was young, and which lead 3
to freedoms and discoveries beyond the three dimensions and realms of life and 3
matter that we know. Not for centuries had any man recalled its vital substance 3
or known where to find it, but this book was very old indeed. No printing-press, 3
but the hand of some half-crazed monk, had traced these ominous Latin phrases 3
in uncials of awesome antiquity. 3
3
I remember how the old man leered and tittered, and made a curious sign with 3
his hand when I bore it away. He had refused to take pay for it, and only long 3
afterwards did I guess why. As I hurried home through those narrow, winding, 3
mist-cloaked waterfront streets I had a frightful impression of being stealthily 3
followed by softly padding feet. The centuried, tottering houses on both sides 3
seemed alive with a fresh and morbid malignity- as if some hitherto closed 3
channel of evil understanding had abruptly been opened. I felt that those walls 3
3
3
3
270 3
3
3
3
and over-hanging gables of mildewed brick and fungoid plaster and timber- 3
with eyelike, diamond-paned windows that leered- could hardly desist from 3
advancing and crushing me . . . yet I had read only the least fragment of that 3
blasphemous rune before closing the book and bringing it away. 3
3
I remember how I read the book at last- white-faced, and locked in the attic room 3
that I had long devoted to strange searchings. The great house was very still, for I 3
had not gone up till after midnight. I think I had a family then- though the details 3
are very uncertain- and I know there were many servants. Just what the year was 3
I cannot say; for since then I have known many ages and dimensions, and have 3
had all my notions of time dissolved and refashioned. It was by the light of 3
candles that I read- I recall the relentless dripping of the wax- and there were 3
chimes that came every now and then from distant belfries. I seemed to keep 3
track of those chimes with a peculiar intentness, as if I feared to hear some very 3
remote, intruding note among them. 3
3
Then came the first scratching and fumbling at the dormer window that looked 3
out high above the other roofs of the city. It came as I droned aloud the ninth 3
verse of that primal lay, and I knew amidst my shudders what it meant. For he 3
who passes the gateways always wins a shadow, and never again can he be 3
alone. I had evoked- and the book was indeed all I had suspected. That night I 3
passed the gateway to a vortex of twisted time and vision, and when morning 3
found me in the attic room I saw in the walls and shelves and fittings that which 3
I had never seen before. 3
3
Nor could I ever after see the world as I had known it. Mixed with the present 3
scene was always a little of the past and a little of the future, and every once- 3
familiar object loomed alien in the new perspective brought by my widened 3
sight. From then on I walked in a fantastic dream of unknown and half-known 3
shapes; and with each new gateway crossed, the less plainly could I recognise the 3
things of the narrow sphere to which I had so long been bound. What I saw 3
about me, none else saw; and I grew doubly silent and aloof lest I be thought 3
mad. Dogs had a fear of me, for they felt the outside shadow which never left my 3
side. But still I read more- in hidden, forgotten books and scrolls to which my 3
new vision led me- and pushed through fresh gateways of space and being and 3
life-patterns toward the core of the unknown cosmos. 3
3
I remember the night I made the five concentric circles of fire on the floor, and 3
stood in the innermost one chanting that monstrous litany the messenger from 3
Tartary had brought. The walls melted away, and I was swept by a black wind 3
through gulfs of fathomless grey with the needle-like pinnacles of unknown 3
mountains miles below me. After a while there was utter blackness, and then the 3
light of myriad stars forming strange, alien constellations. Finally I saw a green- 3
3
3
3
271 3
3
3
3
litten plain far below me, and discerned on it the twisted towers of a city built in 3
no fashion I had ever known or read or dreamed of. As I floated closer to that 3
city I saw a great square building of stone in an open space, and felt a hideous 3
fear clutching at me. I screamed and struggled, and after a blankness was again 3
in my attic room sprawled flat over the five phosphorescent circles on the floor. 3
In that night's wandering there was no more of strangeness than in many a 3
former night's wandering; but there was more of terror because I knew I was 3
closer to those outside gulfs and worlds than I had ever been before. Thereafter I 3
was more cautious with my incantations, for I had no wish to be cut off from my 3
body and from the earth in unknown abysses whence I could never return. . . 3

I. The Horror In Clay 3
3
The most merciful thing in the world, I think, is the inability of the human mind 3
to correlate all its contents. We live on a placid island of ignorance in the midst of 3
black seas of infinity, and it was not meant that we should voyage far. The 3
sciences, each straining in its own direction, have hitherto harmed us little; but 3
some day the piecing together of dissociated knowledge will open up such 3
terrifying vistas of reality, and of our frightful position therein, that we shall 3
either go mad from the revelation or flee from the light into the peace and safety 3
of a new dark age. 3
3
Theosophists have guessed at the awesome grandeur of the cosmic cycle wherein 3
our world and human race form transient incidents. They have hinted at strange 3
survivals in terms which would freeze the blood if not masked by a bland 3
optimism. But it is not from them that there came the single glimpse of forbidden 3
eons which chills me when I think of it and maddens me when I dream of it. That 3
glimpse, like all dread glimpses of truth, flashed out from an accidental piecing 3
together of separated things - in this case an old newspaper item and the notes of 3
a dead professor. I hope that no one else will accomplish this piecing out; 3
certainly, if I live, I shall never knowingly supply a link in so hideous a chain. I 3
think that the professor, too intented to keep silent regarding the part he knew, 3
and that he would have destroyed his notes had not sudden death seized him. 3
3
My knowledge of the thing began in the winter of 1926-27 with the death of my 3
great-uncle, George Gammell Angell, Professor Emeritus of Semitic Languages in 3
Brown University, Providence, Rhode Island. Professor Angell was widely 3
known as an authority on ancient inscriptions, and had frequently been resorted 3
to by the heads of prominent museums; so that his passing at the age of ninety- 3
two may be recalled by many. Locally, interest was intensified by the obscurity 3
of the cause of death. The professor had been stricken whilst returning from the 3
3
3
3
273 3
3
3
3
Newport boat; falling suddenly; as witnesses said, after having been jostled by a 3
nautical-looking negro who had come from one of the queer dark courts on the 3
precipitous hillside which formed a short cut from the waterfront to the 3
deceased's home in Williams Street. Physicians were unable to find any visible 3
disorder, but concluded after perplexed debate that some obscure lesion of the 3
heart, induced by the brisk ascent of so steep a hill by so elderly a man, was 3
responsible for the end. At the time I saw no reason to dissent from this dictum, 3
but latterly I am inclined to wonder - and more than wonder. 3
3
As my great-uncle's heir and executor, for he died a childless widower, I was 3
expected to go over his papers with some thoroughness; and for that purpose 3
moved his entire set of files and boxes to my quarters in Boston. Much of the 3
material which I correlated will be later published by the American 3
Archaeological Society, but there was one box which I found exceedingly 3
puzzling, and which I felt much averse from showing to other eyes. It had been 3
locked and I did not find the key till it occurred to me to examine the personal 3
ring which the professor carried in his pocket. Then, indeed, I succeeded in 3
opening it, but when I did so seemed only to be confronted by a greater and 3
more closely locked barrier. For what could be the meaning of the queer clay bas- 3
relief and the disjointed jottings, ramblings, and cuttings which I found? Had my 3
uncle, in his latter years become credulous of the most superficial impostures? I 3
resolved to search out the eccentric sculptor responsible for this apparent 3
disturbance of an old man's peace of mind. 3
3
The bas-relief was a rough rectangle less than an inch thick and about five by six 3
inches in area; obviously of modern origin. Its designs, however, were far from 3
modern in atmosphere and suggestion; for, although the vagaries of cubism and 3
futurism are many and wild, they do not often reproduce that cryptic regularity 3
which lurks in prehistoric writing. And writing of some kind the bulk of these 3
designs seemed certainly to be; though my memory, despite much the papers 3
and collections of my uncle, failed in any way to identify this particular species, 3
or even hint at its remotest affiliations. 3
3
Above these apparent hieroglyphics was a figure of evident pictorial intent, 3
though its impressionistic execution forbade a very clear idea of its nature. It 3
seemed to be a sort of monster, or symbol representing a monster, of a form 3
which only a diseased fancy could conceive. If I say that my somewhat 3
extravagant imagination yielded simultaneous pictures of an octopus, a dragon, 3
and a human caricature, I shall not be unfaithful to the spirit of the thing. A 3
pulpy, tentacled head surmounted a grotesque and scaly body with rudimentary 3
wings; but it was the general outline of the whole which made it most shockingly 3
frightful. Behind the figure was a vague suggestions of a Cyclopean architectural 3
background. 3
3
3

3
3
3
The writing accompanying this oddity was, aside from a stack of press cuttings, 3
in Professor Angell's most recent hand; and made no pretense to Hterary style. 3
What seemed to be the main document was headed "CTHULHU CULT" in 3
characters painstakingly printed to avoid the erroneous reading of a word so 3
unheard-of. This manuscript was divided into two sections, the first of which 3
was headed "1925 - Dream and Dream Work of H.A. Wilcox, 7 Thomas St., 3
Providence, R. I.", and the second, "Narrative of Inspector John R. Legrasse, 121 3
Bienville St., New Orleans, La., at 1908 A. A. S. Mtg. - Notes on Same, & Prof. 3
Webb's Acct." The other manuscript papers were brief notes, some of them 3
accounts of the queer dreams of different persons, some of them citations from 3
theosophical books and magazines (notably W. Scott-Elliot's Atlantis and the 3
Lost Lemuria), and the rest comments on long-surviving secret societies and 3
hidden cults, with references to passages in such mythological and 3
anthropological source-books as Frazer's Golden Bough and Miss Murray's 3
Witch-Cult in Western Europe. The cuttings largely alluded to outre mental 3
illness and outbreaks of group folly or mania in the spring of 1925. 3
3
The first half of the principal manuscript told a very particular tale. It appears 3
that on March 1st, 1925, a thin, dark young man of neurotic and excited aspect 3
had called upon Professor Angell bearing the singular clay bas-relief, which was 3
then exceedingly damp and fresh. His card bore the name of Henry Anthony 3
Wilcox, and my uncle had recognized him as the youngest son of an excellent 3
family slightly known to him, who had latterly been studying sculpture at the 3
Rhode Island School of Design and living alone at the Fleur-de-Lys Building near 3
that institution. Wilcox was a precocious youth of known genius but great 3
eccentricity, and had from chidhood excited attention through the strange stories 3
and odd dreams he was in the habit of relating. He called himself "psychically 3
hypersensitive", but the staid folk of the ancient commercial city dismissed him 3
as merely "queer." Never mingling much with his kind, he had dropped 3
gradually from social visibility, and was now known only to a small group of 3
esthetes from other towns. Even the Providence Art Club, anxious to preserve its 3
conservatism, had found him quite hopeless. 3
3
On the ocassion of the visit, ran the professor's manuscript, the sculptor abruptly 3
asked for the benefit of his host's archeological knowledge in identifying the 3
hieroglyphics of the bas-relief. He spoke in a dreamy, stilted manner which 3
suggested pose and alienated sympathy; and my uncle showed some sharpness 3
in replying, for the conspicuous freshness of the tablet implied kinship with 3
anything but archeology. Young Wilcox's rejoinder, which impressed my uncle 3
enough to make him recall and record it verbatim, was of a fantastically poetic 3
cast which must have typified his whole conversation, and which I have since 3
found highly characteristic of him. He said, "It is new, indeed, for I made it last 3
3
3
3
275 3
3
3
3
night in a dream of strange cities; and dreams are older than brooding Tyre, or 3
the contemplative Sphinx, or garden-girdled Babylon." 3
3
It was then that he began that rambling tale which suddenly played upon a 3
sleeping memory and won the fevered interest of my uncle. There had been a 3
slight earthquake tremor the night before, the most considerable felt in New 3
England for some years; and Wilcox's imagination had been keenly affected. 3
Upon retiring, he had had an unprecedented dream of great Cyclopean cities of 3
Titan blocks and sky-flung monoliths, all dripping with green ooze and sinister 3
with latent horror. Hieroglyphics had covered the walls and pillars, and from 3
some undetermined point below had come a voice that was not a voice; a chaotic 3
sensation which only fancy could transmute into sound, but which he attempted 3
to render by the almost unpronounceable jumble of letters: "Cthulhu fhtagn." 3
3
This verbal jumble was the key to the recollection which excited and disturbed 3
Professor Angell. He questioned the sculptor with scientific minuteness; and 3
studied with frantic intensity the bas-relief on which the youth had found 3
himself working, chilled and clad only in his night clothes, when waking had 3
stolen bewilderingly over him. My uncle blamed his old age, Wilcox afterwards 3
said, for his slowness in recognizing both hieroglyphics and pictorial design. 3
Many of his questions seemed highly out of place to his visitor, especially those 3
which tried to connect the latter with strange cults or societies; and Wilcox could 3
not understand the repeated promises of silence which he was offered in 3
exchange for an admission of membership in some widespread mystical or 3
paganly religious body. When Professor Angell became convinced that the 3
sculptor was indeed ignorant of any cult or system of cryptic lore, he besieged 3
his visitor with demands for future reports of dreams. This bore regular fruit, for 3
after the first interview the manuscript records daily calls of the young man, 3
during which he related startling fragments of nocturnal imaginery whose 3
burden was always some terrible Cyclopean vista of dark and dripping stone, 3
with a subterrene voice or intelligence shouting monotonously in enigmatical 3
sense-impacts uninscribable save as gibberish. The two sounds frequently 3
repeated are those rendered by the letters "Cthulhu" and "R'lyeh." 3
3
On March 23, the manuscript continued, Wilcox failed to appear; and inquiries at 3
his quarters revealed that he had been stricken with an obscure sort of fever and 3
taken to the home of his family in Waterman Street. He had cried out in the 3
night, arousing several other artists in the building, and had manifested since 3
then only alternations of unconsciousness and delirium. My uncle at once 3
telephoned the family, and from that time forward kept close watch of the case; 3
calling often at the Thayer Street office of Dr. Tobey, whom he learned to be in 3
charge. The youth's febrile mind, apparently, was dwelling on strange things; 3
and the doctor shuddered now and then as he spoke of them. They included not 3
3
3
3
276 3
3
3
3
only a repetition of what he had formerly dreamed, but touched wildly on a 3
gigantic thing "miles high" which walked or lumbered about. 3
3
He at no time fully described this object but occasional frantic words, as repeated 3
by Dr. Tobey, convinced the professor that it must be identical with the nameless 3
monstrosity he had sought to depict in his dream-sculpture. Reference to this 3
object, the doctor added, was invariably a prelude to the young man's 3
subsidence into lethargy. His temperature, oddly enough, was not greatly above 3
normal; but the whole condition was otherwise such as to suggest true fever 3
rather than mental disorder. 3
3
On April 2 at about 3 P.M. every trace of Wilcox's malady suddenly ceased. He 3
sat upright in bed, astonished to find himself at home and completely ignorant of 3
what had happened in dream or reality since the night of March 22. Pronounced 3
well by his physician, he returned to his quarters in three days; but to Professor 3
Angell he was of no further assistance. All traces of strange dreaming had 3
vanished with his recovery, and my uncle kept no record of his night-thoughts 3
after a week of pointless and irrelevant accounts of thoroughly usual visions. 3
3
Here the first part of the manuscript ended, but references to certain of the 3
scattered notes gave me much material for thought - so much, in fact, that only 3
the ingrained skepticism then forming my philosophy can account for my 3
continued distrust of the artist. The notes in question were those descriptive of 3
the dreams of various persons covering the same period as that in which young 3
Wilcox had had his strange visitations. My uncle, it seems, had quickly instituted 3
a prodigiously far-flung body of inquires amongst nearly all the friends whom 3
he could question without impertinence, asking for nightly reports of their 3
dreams, and the dates of any notable visions for some time past. The reception of 3
his request seems to have varied; but he must, at the very least, have received 3
more responses than any ordinary man could have handled without a secretary. 3
This original correspondence was not preserved, but his notes formed a 3
thorough and really significant digest. Average people in society and business - 3
New England's traditional "salt of the earth" - gave an almost completely 3
negative result, though scattered cases of uneasy but formless nocturnal 3
impressions appear here and there, always between March 23 and and April 2 - 3
the period of young Wilcox's delirium. Scientific men were little more affected, 3
though four cases of vague description suggest fugitive glimpses of strange 3
landscapes, and in one case there is mentioned a dread of something abnormal. 3
3
It was from the artists and poets that the pertinent answers came, and I know 3
that panic would have broken loose had they been able to compare notes. As it 3
was, lacking their original letters, I half suspected the compiler of having asked 3
leading questions, or of having edited the correspondence in corroboration of 3
3
3
3
277 3
3
3
3
what he had latently resolved to see. That is why I continued to feel that Wilcox, 3
somehow cognizant of the old data which my uncle had possessed, had been 3
imposing on the veteran scientist. These responses from esthetes told disturbing 3
tale. From February 28 to April 2 a large proportion of them had dreamed very 3
bizarre things, the intensity of the dreams being immeasurably the stronger 3
during the period of the sculptor's delirium. Over a fourth of those who reported 3
anything, reported scenes and half-sounds not unlike those which Wilcox had 3
described; and some of the dreamers confessed acute fear of the gigantic 3
nameless thing visible toward the last. One case, which the note describes with 3
emphasis, was very sad. The subject, a widely known architect with leanings 3
toward theosophy and occultism, went violently insane on the date of young 3
Wilcox's seizure, and expired several months later after incessant screamings to 3
be saved from some escaped denizen of hell. Had my uncle referred to these 3
cases by name instead of merely by number, I should have attempted some 3
corroboration and personal investigation; but as it was, I succeeded in tracing 3
down only a few. All of these, however, bore out the notes in full. I have often 3
wondered if all the the objects of the professor's questioning felt as puzzled as 3
did this fraction. It is well that no explanation shall ever reach them. 3
3
The press cuttings, as I have intimated, touched on cases of panic, mania, and 3
eccentricity during the given period. Professor Angell must have employed a 3
cutting bureau, for the number of extracts was tremendous, and the sources 3
scattered throughout the globe. Here was a nocturnal suicide in London, where a 3
lone sleeper had leaped from a window after a shocking cry. Here likewise a 3
rambling letter to the editor of a paper in South America, where a fanatic 3
deduces a dire future from visions he has seen. A dispatch from California 3
describes a theosophist colony as donning white robes en masse for some 3
"glorious fulfiment" which never arrives, whilst items from India speak 3
guardedly of serious native unrest toward the end of March 22-23. 3
3
The west of Ireland, too, is full of wild rumour and legendry, and a fantastic 3
painter named Ardois-Bonnot hangs a blasphemous Dream Landscape in the 3
Paris spring salon of 1926. And so numerous are the recorded troubles in insane 3
asylums that only a miracle can have stopped the medical fraternity from noting 3
strange parallelisms and drawing mystified conclusions. A weird bunch of 3
cuttings, all told; and I can at this date scarcely envisage the callous rationalism 3
with which I set them aside. But I was then convinced that young Wilcox had 3
known of the older matters mentioned by the professor. 3
3
II. The Tale of Inspector Legrasse. 3
3
The older matters which had made the sculptor's dream and bas-relief so 3
significant to my uncle formed the subject of the second half of his long 3
3
3
3
278 3
3
3
3
manuscript. Once before, it appears. Professor Angell had seen the helHsh 3
outhnes of the nameless monstrosity, puzzled over the unknown hieroglyphics, 3
and heard the ominous syllables which can be rendered only as "Cthulhu"; and 3
all this in so stirring and horrible a connexion that it is small wonder he pursued 3
young Wilcox with queries and demands for data. 3
3
This earlier experience had come in 1908, seventeen years before, when the 3
American Archaeological Society held its annual meeting in St. Louis. Professor 3
Angell, as befitted one of his authority and attainments, had had a prominent 3
part in all the deliberations; and was one of the first to be approached by the 3
several outsiders who took advantage of the convocation to offer questions for 3
correct answering and problems for expert solution. 3
3
The chief of these outsiders, and in a short time the focus of interest for the entire 3
meeting, was a commonplace-looking middle-aged man who had travelled all 3
the way from New Orleans for certain special information unobtainable from any 3
local source. His name was John Raymond Legrasse, and he was by profession 3
an Inspector of Police. With him he bore the subject of his visit, a grotesque, 3
repulsive, and apparently very ancient stone statuette whose origin he was at a 3
loss to determine. It must not be fancied that Inspector Legrasse had the least 3
interest in archaeology. On the contrary, his wish for enlightenment was 3
prompted by purely professional considerations. The statuette, idol, fetish, or 3
whatever it was, had been captured some months before in the wooded swamps 3
south of New Orleans during a raid on a supposed voodoo meeting; and so 3
singular and hideous were the rites connected with it, that the police could not 3
but realise that they had stumbled on a dark cult totally unknown to them, and 3
infinitely more diabolic than even the blackest of the African voodoo circles. Of 3
its origin, apart from the erratic and unbelievable tales extorted from the 3
captured members, absolutely nothing was to be discovered; hence the anxiety of 3
the police for any antiquarian lore which might help them to place the frightful 3
symbol, and through it track down the cult to its fountain-head. 3
3
Inspector Legrasse was scarcely prepared for the sensation which his offering 3
created. One sight of the thing had been enough to throw the assembled men of 3
science into a state of tense excitement, and they lost no time in crowding around 3
him to gaze at the diminutive figure whose utter strangeness and air of 3
genuinely abysmal antiquity hinted so potently at unopened and archaic vistas. 3
No recognised school of sculpture had animated this terrible object, yet centuries 3
and even thousands of years seemed recorded in its dim and greenish surface of 3
unplaceable stone. 3
3
The figure, which was finally passed slowly from man to man for close and 3
careful study, was between seven and eight inches in height, and of exquisitely 3
3
3
3
279 3
3
3
3
artistic workmanship. It represented a monster of vaguely anthropoid outHne, 3
but with an octopus-Hke head whose face was a mass of feelers, a scaly, rubbery- 3
looking body, prodigious claws on hind and fore feet, and long, narrow wings 3
behind. This thing, which seemed instinct with a fearsome and unnatural 3
malignancy, was of a somewhat bloated corpulence, and squatted evilly on a 3
rectangular block or pedestal covered with undecipherable characters. The tips of 3
the wings touched the back edge of the block, the seat occupied the centre, whilst 3
the long, curved claws of the doubled-up, crouching hind legs gripped the front 3
edge and extended a quarter of the way clown toward the bottom of the 3
pedestal. The cephalopod head was bent forward, so that the ends of the facial 3
feelers brushed the backs of huge fore paws which clasped the croucher's 3
elevated knees. The aspect of the whole was abnormally life-like, and the more 3
subtly fearful because its source was so totally unknown. Its vast, awesome, and 3
incalculable age was unmistakable; yet not one link did it shew with any known 3
type of art belonging to civilisation's youth - or indeed to any other time. Totally 3
separate and apart, its very material was a mystery; for the soapy, greenish-black 3
stone with its golden or iridescent flecks and striations resembled nothing 3
familiar to geology or mineralogy. The characters along the base were equally 3
baffling; and no member present, despite a representation of half the world's 3
expert learning in this field, could form the least notion of even their remotest 3
linguistic kinship. They, like the subject and material, belonged to something 3
horribly remote and distinct from mankind as we know it. something frightfully 3
suggestive of old and unhallowed cycles of life in which our world and our 3
conceptions have no part. 3
3
And yet, as the members severally shook their heads and confessed defeat at the 3
Inspector's problem, there was one man in that gathering who suspected a touch 3
of bizarre familiarity in the monstrous shape and writing, and who presently 3
told with some diffidence of the odd trifle he knew. This person was the late 3
William Channing Webb, Professor of Anthropology in Princeton University, 3
and an explorer of no slight note. Professor Webb had been engaged, forty-eight 3
years before, in a tour of Greenland and Iceland in search of some Runic 3
inscriptions which he failed to unearth; and whilst high up on the West 3
Greenland coast had encountered a singular tribe or cult of degenerate 3
Esquimaux whose religion, a curious form of devil-worship, chilled him with its 3
deliberate bloodthirstiness and repulsiveness. It was a faith of which other 3
Esquimaux knew little, and which they mentioned only with shudders, saying 3
that it had come down from horribly ancient aeons before ever the world was 3
made. Besides nameless rites and human sacrifices there were certain queer 3
hereditary rituals addressed to a supreme elder devil or tornasuk; and of this 3
Professor Webb had taken a careful phonetic copy from an aged angekok or 3
wizard-priest, expressing the sounds in Roman letters as best he knew how. But 3
just now of prime significance was the fetish which this cult had cherished, and 3
3
3
3
280 3
3
3
3
around which they danced when the aurora leaped high over the ice chffs. It 3
was, the professor stated, a very crude bas-rehef of stone, comprising a hideous 3
picture and some cryptic writing. And so far as he could tell, it was a rough 3
parallel in all essential features of the bestial thing now lying before the meeting. 3
3
This data, received with suspense and astonishment by the assembled members, 3
proved doubly exciting to Inspector Legrasse; and he began at once to ply his 3
informant with questions. Having noted and copied an oral ritual among the 3
swamp cult-worshippers his men had arrested, he besought the professor to 3
remember as best he might the syllables taken down amongst the diabolist 3
Esquimaux. There then followed an exhaustive comparison of details, and a 3
moment of really awed silence when both detective and scientist agreed on the 3
virtual identity of the phrase common to two hellish rituals so many worlds of 3
distance apart. What, in substance, both the Esquimaux wizards and the 3
Louisiana swamp-priests had chanted to their kindred idols was something very 3
like this: the word-divisions being guessed at from traditional breaks in the 3
phrase as chanted aloud: 3
3
"Ph'nglui mglw'nafh Cthulhu R'lyeh wgah'nagl fhtagn." 3
3
Legrasse had one point in advance of Professor Webb, for several among his 3
mongrel prisoners had repeated to him what older celebrants had told them the 3
words meant. This text, as given, ran something like this: 3
3
"In his house at R'lyeh dead Cthulhu waits dreaming." 3
3
And now, in response to a general and urgent demand. Inspector Legrasse 3
related as fully as possible his experience with the swamp worshippers; telling a 3
story to which I could see my uncle attached profound significance. It savoured 3
of the wildest dreams of myth-maker and theosophist, and disclosed an 3
astonishing degree of cosmic imagination among such half-castes and pariahs as 3
might be least expected to possess it. 3
3
On November 1st, 1907, there had come to the New Orleans police a frantic 3
summons from the swamp and lagoon country to the south. The squatters there, 3
mostly primitive but good-natured descendants of Lafitte's men, were in the grip 3
of stark terror from an unknown thing which had stolen upon them in the night. 3
It was voodoo, apparently, but voodoo of a more terrible sort than they had ever 3
known; and some of their women and children had disappeared since the 3
malevolent tom-tom had begun its incessant beating far within the black haunted 3
woods where no dweller ventured. There were insane shouts and harrowing 3
screams, soul-chilling chants and dancing devil-flames; and, the frightened 3
messenger added, the people could stand it no more. 3
3
3
3
281 3
3
3
3
So a body of twenty police, filling two carriages and an automobile, had set out 3
in the late afternoon with the shivering squatter as a guide. At the end of the 3
passable road they alighted, and for miles splashed on in silence through the 3
terrible cypress woods where day never came. Ugly roots and malignant 3
hanging nooses of Spanish moss beset them, and now and then a pile of dank 3
stones or fragment of a rotting wall intensified by its hint of morbid habitation a 3
depression which every malformed tree and every fungous islet combined to 3
create. At length the squatter settlement, a miserable huddle of huts, hove in 3
sight; and hysterical dwellers ran out to cluster around the group of bobbing 3
lanterns. The muffled beat of tom-toms was now faintly audible far, far ahead; 3
and a curdling shriek came at infrequent intervals when the wind shifted. A 3
reddish glare, too, seemed to filter through pale undergrowth beyond the endless 3
avenues of forest night. Reluctant even to be left alone again, each one of the 3
cowed squatters refused point-blank to advance another inch toward the scene of 3
unholy worship, so Inspector Legrasse and his nineteen colleagues plunged on 3
unguided into black arcades of horror that none of them had ever trod before. 3
3
The region now entered by the police was one of traditionally evil repute, 3
substantially unknown and untraversed by white men. There were legends of a 3
hidden lake unglimpsed by mortal sight, in which dwelt a huge, formless white 3
polypous thing with luminous eyes; and squatters whispered that bat-winged 3
devils flew up out of caverns in inner earth to worship it at midnight. They said 3
it had been there before d'Iberville, before La Salle, before the Indians, and before 3
even the wholesome beasts and birds of the woods. It was nightmare itself, and 3
to see it was to die. But it made men dream, and so they knew enough to keep 3
away. The present voodoo orgy was, indeed, on the merest fringe of this 3
abhorred area, but that location was bad enough; hence perhaps the very place of 3
the worship had terrified the squatters more than the shocking sounds and 3
incidents. 3
3
Only poetry or madness could do justice to the noises heard by Legrasse's men 3
as they ploughed on through the black morass toward the red glare and muffled 3
tom-toms. There are vocal qualities peculiar to men, and vocal qualities peculiar 3
to beasts; and it is terrible to hear the one when the source should yield the other. 3
Animal fury and orgiastic license here whipped themselves to daemoniac heights 3
by howls and squawking ecstacies that tore and reverberated through those 3
nighted woods like pestilential tempests from the gulfs of hell. Now and then the 3
less organized ululation would cease, and from what seemed a well-drilled 3
chorus of hoarse voices would rise in sing-song chant that hideous phrase or 3
ritual: 3
3
"Ph'nglui mglw'nafh Cthulhu R'lyeh wgah'nagl fhtagn." 3
3
3
3
282 3
3
3
3
Then the men, having reached a spot where the trees were thinner, came 3
suddenly in sight of the spectacle itself. Four of them reeled, one fainted, and two 3
were shaken into a frantic cry which the mad cacophony of the orgy fortunately 3
deadened. Legrasse dashed swamp water on the face of the fainting man, and all 3
stood trembling and nearly hypnotised with horror. 3
3
In a natural glade of the swamp stood a grassy island of perhaps an acre's extent, 3
clear of trees and tolerably dry. On this now leaped and twisted a more 3
indescribable horde of human abnormality than any but a Sime or an Angarola 3
could paint. Void of clothing, this hybrid spawn were braying, bellowing, and 3
writhing about a monstrous ring-shaped bonfire; in the centre of which, revealed 3
by occasional rifts in the curtain of flame, stood a great granite monolith some 3
eight feet in height; on top of which, incongruous in its diminutiveness, rested 3
the noxious carven statuette. From a wide circle of ten scaffolds set up at regular 3
intervals with the flame-girt monolith as a centre hung, head downward, the 3
oddly marred bodies of the helpless squatters who had disappeared. It was 3
inside this circle that the ring of worshippers jumped and roared, the general 3
direction of the mass motion being from left to right in endless Bacchanal 3
between the ring of bodies and the ring of fire. 3
3
It may have been only imagination and it may have been only echoes which 3
induced one of the men, an excitable Spaniard, to fancy he heard antiphonal 3
responses to the ritual from some far and unillumined spot deeper within the 3
wood of ancient legendry and horror. This man, Joseph D. Galvez, I later met 3
and questioned; and he proved distractingly imaginative. He indeed went so far 3
as to hint of the faint beating of great wings, and of a glimpse of shining eyes and 3
a mountainous white bulk beyond the remotest trees but I suppose he had been 3
hearing too much native superstition. 3
3
Actually, the horrified pause of the men was of comparatively brief duration. 3
Duty came first; and although there must have been nearly a hundred mongrel 3
celebrants in the throng, the police relied on their firearms and plunged 3
determinedly into the nauseous rout. For five minutes the resultant din and 3
chaos were beyond description. Wild blows were struck, shots were fired, and 3
escapes were made; but in the end Legrasse was able to count some forty-seven 3
sullen prisoners, whom he forced to dress in haste and fall into line between two 3
rows of policemen. Five of the worshippers lay dead, and two severely wounded 3
ones were carried away on improvised stretchers by their fellow-prisoners. The 3
image on the monolith, of course, was carefully removed and carried back by 3
Legrasse. 3
3
Examined at headquarters after a trip of intense strain and weariness, the 3
prisoners all proved to be men of a very low, mixed-blooded, and mentally 3
3
3
3
283 3
3
3
3
aberrant type. Most were seamen, and a sprinkling of Negroes and mulattoes, 3
largely West Indians or Brava Portuguese from the Cape Verde Islands, gave a 3
colouring of voodooism to the heterogeneous cult. But before many questions 3
were asked, it became manifest that something far deeper and older than Negro 3
fetishism was involved. Degraded and ignorant as they were, the creatures held 3
with surprising consistency to the central idea of their loathsome faith. 3
3
They worshipped, so they said, the Great Old Ones who lived ages before there 3
were any men, and who came to the young world out of the sky. Those Old Ones 3
were gone now, inside the earth and under the sea; but their dead bodies had 3
told their secrets in dreams to the first men, who formed a cult which had never 3
died. This was that cult, and the prisoners said it had always existed and always 3
would exist, hidden in distant wastes and dark places all over the world until the 3
time when the great priest Cthulhu, from his dark house in the mighty city of 3
R'lyeh under the waters, should rise and bring the earth again beneath his sway. 3
Some day he would call, when the stars were ready, and the secret cult would 3
always be waiting to liberate him. 3
3
Meanwhile no more must be told. There was a secret which even torture could 3
not extract. Mankind was not absolutely alone among the conscious things of 3
earth, for shapes came out of the dark to visit the faithful few. But these were not 3
the Great Old Ones. No man had ever seen the Old Ones. The carven idol was 3
great Cthulhu, but none might say whether or not the others were precisely like 3
him. No one could read the old writing now, but things were told by word of 3
mouth. The chanted ritual was not the secret - that was never spoken aloud, only 3
whispered. The chant meant only this: "In his house at R'lyeh dead Cthulhu 3
waits dreaming." 3
3
Only two of the prisoners were found sane enough to be hanged, and the rest 3
were committed to various institutions. All denied a part in the ritual murders, 3
and averred that the killing had been done by Black Winged Ones which had 3
come to them from their immemorial meeting-place in the haunted wood. But of 3
those mysterious allies no coherent account could ever be gained. What the 3
police did extract, came mainly from the immensely aged mestizo named Castro, 3
who claimed to have sailed to strange ports and talked with undying leaders of 3
the cult in the mountains of China. 3
3
Old Castro remembered bits of hideous legend that paled the speculations of 3
theosophists and made man and the world seem recent and transient indeed. 3
There had been aeons when other Things ruled on the earth, and They had had 3
great cities. Remains of Them, he said the deathless Chinamen had told him, 3
were still be found as Cyclopean stones on islands in the Pacific. They all died 3
vast epochs of time before men came, but there were arts which could revive 3
3
3
3
284 3
3
3
3
Them when the stars had come round again to the right positions in the cycle of 3
eternity. They had, indeed, come themselves from the stars, and brought Their 3
images with Them. 3
3
These Great Old Ones, Castro continued, were not composed altogether of flesh 3
and blood. They had shape - for did not this star-fashioned image prove it? - but 3
that shape was not made of matter. When the stars were right. They could 3
plunge from world to world through the sky; but when the stars were wrong. 3
They could not live. But although They no longer lived. They would never really 3
die. They all lay in stone houses in Their great city of R'lyeh, preserved by the 3
spells of mighty Cthulhu for a glorious surrection when the stars and the earth 3
might once more be ready for Them. But at that time some force from outside 3
must serve to liberate Their bodies. The spells that preserved them intact 3
likewise prevented Them from making an initial move, and They could only lie 3
awake in the dark and think whilst uncounted millions of years rolled by. They 3
knew all that was occurring in the universe, for Their mode of speech was 3
transmitted thought. Even now They talked in Their tombs. When, after infinities 3
of chaos, the first men came, the Great Old Ones spoke to the sensitive among 3
them by moulding their dreams; for only thus could Their language reach the 3
fleshly minds of mammals. 3
3
Then, whispered Castro, those first men formed the cult around tall idols which 3
the Great Ones shewed them; idols brought in dim eras from dark stars. That cult 3
would never die till the stars came right again, and the secret priests would take 3
great Cthulhu from His tomb to revive His subjects and resume His rule of earth. 3
The time would be easy to know, for then mankind would have become as the 3
Great Old Ones; free and wild and beyond good and evil, with laws and morals 3
thrown aside and all men shouting and killing and revelling in joy. Then the 3
liberated Old Ones would teach them new ways to shout and kill and revel and 3
enjoy themselves, and all the earth would flame with a holocaust of ecstasy and 3
freedom. Meanwhile the cult, by appropriate rites, must keep alive the memory 3
of those ancient ways and shadow forth the prophecy of their return. 3
3
In the elder time chosen men had talked with the entombed Old Ones in dreams, 3
but then something happened. The great stone city R'lyeh, with its monoliths 3
and sepulchres, had sunk beneath the waves; and the deep waters, full of the one 3
primal mystery through which not even thought can pass, had cut off the 3
spectral intercourse. But memory never died, and the high-priests said that the 3
city would rise again when the stars were right. Then came out of the earth the 3
black spirits of earth, mouldy and shadowy, and full of dim rumours picked up 3
in caverns beneath forgotten sea-bottoms. But of them old Castro dared not 3
speak much. He cut himself off hurriedly, and no amount of persuasion or 3
subtlety could elicit more in this direction. The size of the Old Ones, too, he 3
3
3
3
285 3
3
3
3
curiously declined to mention. Of the cult, he said that he thought the centre lay 3
amid the pathless desert of Arabia, where Irem, the City of Pillars, dreams 3
hidden and untouched. It was not allied to the European witch-cult, and was 3
virtually unknown beyond its members. No book had ever really hinted of it, 3
though the deathless Chinamen said that there were double meanings in the 3
Necronomicon of the mad Arab Abdul Alhazred which the initiated might read 3
as they chose, especially the much-discussed couplet: 3
3
That is not dead which can eternal lie. 3
3
And with strange aeons even death may die. 3
3
Legrasse, deeply impressed and not a little bewildered, had inquired in vain 3
concerning the historic affiliations of the cult. Castro, apparently, had told the 3
truth when he said that it was wholly secret. The authorities at Tulane University 3
could shed no light upon either cult or image, and now the detective had come to 3
the highest authorities in the country and met with no more than the Greenland 3
tale of Professor Webb. 3
3
The feverish interest aroused at the meeting by Legrasse's tale, corroborated as it 3
was by the statuette, is echoed in the subsequent correspondence of those who 3
attended; although scant mention occurs in the formal publications of the society. 3
Caution is the first care of those accustomed to face occasional charlatanry and 3
imposture. Legrasse for some time lent the image to Professor Webb, but at the 3
latter's death it was returned to him and remains in his possession, where I 3
viewed it not long ago. It is truly a terrible thing, and unmistakably akin to the 3
dream-sculpture of young Wilcox. 3
3
That my uncle was excited by the tale of the sculptor I did not wonder, for what 3
thoughts must arise upon hearing, after a knowledge of what Legrasse had 3
learned of the cult, of a sensitive young man who had dreamed not only the 3
figure and exact hieroglyphics of the swamp-found image and the Greenland 3
devil tablet, but had come in his dreams upon at least three of the precise words 3
of the formula uttered alike by Esquimaux diabolists and mongrel Louisianans?. 3
Professor Angell's instant start on an investigation of the utmost thoroughness 3
was eminently natural; though privately I suspected young Wilcox of having 3
heard of the cult in some indirect way, and of having invented a series of dreams 3
to heighten and continue the mystery at my uncle's expense. The dream- 3
narratives and cuttings collected by the professor were, of course, strong 3
corroboration; but the rationalism of my mind and the extravagance of the whole 3
subject led me to adopt what I thought the most sensible conclusions. So, after 3
thoroughly studying the manuscript again and correlating the theosophical and 3
anthropological notes with the cult narrative of Legrasse, I made a trip to 3
3
3
3
286 3
3
3
3
Providence to see the sculptor and give him the rebuke I thought proper for so 3
boldly imposing upon a learned and aged man. 3
3
Wilcox still lived alone in the Fleur-de-Lys Building in Thomas Street, a hideous 3
Victorian imitation of seventeenth century Breton Architecture which flaunts its 3
stuccoed front amidst the lovely olonial houses on the ancient hill, and under the 3
very shadow of the finest Georgian steeple in America, I found him at work in 3
his rooms, and at once conceded from the specimens scattered about that his 3
genius is indeed profound and authentic. He will, I believe, some time be heard 3
from as one of the great decadents; for he has crystallised in clay and will one 3
day mirror in marble those nightmares and phantasies which Arthur Machen 3
evokes in prose, and Clark Ashton Smith makes visible in verse and in painting. 3
3
Dark, frail, and somewhat unkempt in aspect, he turned languidly at my knock 3
and asked me my business without rising. Then I told him who I was, he 3
displayed some interest; for my uncle had excited his curiosity in probing his 3
strange dreams, yet had never explained the reason for the study. I did not 3
enlarge his knowledge in this regard, but sought with some subtlety to draw him 3
out. In a short time I became convinced ofhis absolute sincerity, for he spoke of 3
the dreams in a manner none could mistake. They and their subconscious 3
residuum had influenced his art profoundly, and he shewed me a morbid statue 3
whose contours almost made me shake with the potency of its black suggestion. 3
He could not recall having seen the original of this thing except in his own dream 3
bas-relief, but the outlines had formed themselves insensibly under his hands. It 3
was, no doubt, the giant shape he had raved of in delirium. That he really knew 3
nothing of the hidden cult, save from what my uncle's relentless catechism had 3
let fall, he soon made clear; and again I strove to think of some way in which he 3
could possibly have received the weird impressions. 3
3
He talked of his dreams in a strangely poetic fashion; making me see with 3
terrible vividness the damp Cyclopean city of slimy green stone - whose 3
geometry, he oddly said, was all wrong - and hear with frightened expectancy 3
the ceaseless, half-mental calling from underground: "Cthulhu fhtagn", 3
"Cthulhu fhtagn." 3
3
These words had formed part of that dread ritual which told of dead Cthulhu's 3
dream-vigil in his stone vault at R'lyeh, and I felt deeply moved despite my 3
rational beliefs. Wilcox, I was sure, had heard of the cult in some casual way, and 3
had soon forgotten it amidst the mass of his equally weird reading and 3
imagining. Later, by virtue of its sheer impressiveness, it had found subconscious 3
expression in dreams, in the bas-relief, and in the terrible statue I now beheld; so 3
that his imposture upon my uncle had been a very innocent one. The youth was 3
of a type, at once slightly affected and slightly ill-mannered, which I could never 3
3
3
3
287 3
3
3
3
like, but I was willing enough now to admit both his genius and his honesty. I 3
took leave of him amicably, and wish him all the success his talent promises. 3
3
The matter of the cult still remained to fascinate me, and at times I had visions of 3
personal fame from researches into its origin and connexions. I visited New 3
Orleans, talked with Legrasse and others of that old-time raiding-party, saw the 3
frightful image, and even questioned such of the mongrel prisoners as still 3
survived. Old Castro, unfortunately, had been dead for some years. What I now 3
heard so graphically at first-hand, though it was really no more than a detailed 3
confirmation of what my uncle had written, excited me afresh; for I felt sure that 3
I was on the track of a very real, very secret, and very ancient religion whose 3
discovery would make me an anthropologist of note. My attitude was still one of 3
absolute materialism, as 1 wish it still were, and I discounted with almost 3
inexplicable perversity the coincidence of the dream notes and odd cuttings 3
collected by Professor Angell. 3
3
One thing I began to suspect, and which I now fear I know, is that my uncle's 3
death was far from natural. He fell on a narrow hill street leading up from an 3
ancient waterfront swarming with foreign mongrels, after a careless push from a 3
Negro sailor. I did not forget the mixed blood and marine pursuits of the cult- 3
members in Louisiana, and would not be surprised to learn of secret methods 3
and rites and beliefs. Legrasse and his men, it is true, have been let alone; but in 3
Norway a certain seaman who saw things is dead. Might not the deeper inquiries 3
of my uncle after encountering the sculptor's data have come to sinister ears?. I 3
think Professor Angell died because he knew too much, or because he was likely 3
to learn too much. Whether I shall go as he did remains to be seen, for I have 3
learned much now. 3
3
III. The Madness from the Sea 3
3
If heaven ever wishes to grant me a boon, it will be a total effacing of the results 3
of a mere chance which fixed my eye on a certain stray piece of shelf-paper. It 3
was nothing on which I would naturally have stumbled in the course of my daily 3
round, for it was an old number of an Australian journal, the Sydney Bulletin for 3
April 18, 1925. It had escaped even the cutting bureau which had at the time of 3
its issuance been avidly collecting material for my uncle's research. 3
3
I had largely given over my inquiries into what Professor Angell called the 3
"Cthulhu Cult", and was visiting a learned friend in Pater son. New Jersey; the 3
curator of a local museum and a mineralogist of note. Examining one day the 3
reserve specimens roughly set on the storage shelves in a rear room of the 3
museum, my eye was caught by an odd picture in one of the old papers spread 3
beneath the stones. It was the Sydney Bulletin I have mentioned, for my friend 3
3
3
3
288 3
3
3
3
had wide affiliations in all conceivable foreign parts; and the picture was a half- 3
tone cut of a hideous stone image almost identical with that which Legrasse had 3
found in the swamp. 3
3
Eagerly clearing the sheet of its precious contents, I scanned the item in detail; 3
and was disappointed to find it of only moderate length. What it suggested, 3
however, was of portentous significance to my flagging quest; and I carefully 3
tore it out for immediate action. It read as follows: 3
3
MYSTERY DERELICT FOUND AT SEA 3
3
Vigilant Arrives With Helpless Armed New Zealand Yacht in Tow. One Survivor 3
and Dead Man Found Aboard. Tale of Desperate Battle and Deaths at Sea. 3
Rescued Seaman Refuses Particulars of Strange Experience. Odd Idol Found in 3
His Possession. Inquiry to Follow. 3
3
The Morrison Co.'s freighter Vigilant, bound from Valparaiso, arrived this 3
morning at its wharf in Darling Harbour, having in tow the battled and disabled 3
but heavily armed steam yacht Alert of Dunedin, N.Z., which was sighted April 3
12th in S. Latitude 34°21', W. Longitude 152°17', with one living and one dead 3
man aboard. 3
3
The Vigilant left Valparaiso March 25th, and on April 2nd was driven 3
considerably south of her course by exceptionally heavy storms and monster 3
waves. On April 12th the derelict was sighted; and though apparently deserted, 3
was found upon boarding to contain one survivor in a half-delirious condition 3
and one man who had evidently been dead for more than a week. The living 3
man was clutching a horrible stone idol of unknown origin, about foot in height, 3
regarding whose nature authorities at Sydney University, the Royal Society, and 3
the Museum in College Street all profess complete bafflement, and which the 3
survivor says he found in the cabin of the yacht, in a small carved shrine of 3
common pattern. 3
3
This man, after recovering his senses, told an exceedingly strange story of piracy 3
and slaughter. He is Gustaf Johansen, a Norwegian of some intelligence, and had 3
been second mate of the two-masted schooner Emma of Auckland, which sailed 3
for Callao February 20th with a complement of eleven men. The Emma, he says, 3
was delayed and thrown widely south of her course by the great storm of March 3
1st, and on March 22nd, in S. Latitude 49°51' W. Longitude 128°34', encountered 3
the Alert, manned by a queer and evil-looking crew of Kanakas and half-castes. 3
Being ordered peremptorily to turn back, Capt. Collins refused; whereupon the 3
strange crew began to fire savagely and without warning upon the schooner 3
with a peculiarly heavy battery of brass cannon forming part of the yacht's 3
3
3
3
289 3
3
3
3
equipment. The Emma's men shewed fight, says the survivor, and though the 3
schooner began to sink from shots beneath the water-hne they managed to heave 3
alongside their enemy and board her, grappHng with the savage crew on the 3
yacht's deck, and being forced to kill them all, the number being slightly 3
superior, because of their particularly abhorrent and desperate though rather 3
clumsy mode of fighting. 3
3
Three of the Emma's men, including Capt. Collins and First Mate Green, were 3
killed; and the remaining eight under Second Mate Johansen proceeded to 3
navigate the captured yacht, going ahead in their original direction to see if any 3
reason for their ordering back had existed. The next day, it appears, they raised 3
and landed on a small island, although none is known to exist in that part of the 3
ocean; and six of the men somehow died ashore, though Johansen is queerly 3
reticent about this part of his story, and speaks only of their falling into a rock 3
chasm. Later, it seems, he and one companion boarded the yacht and tried to 3
manage her, but were beaten about by the storm of April 2nd, From that time till 3
his rescue on the 12th the man remembers little, and he does not even recall 3
when William Briden, his companion, died. Briden's death reveals no apparent 3
cause, and was probably due to excitement or exposure. Cable advices from 3
Dunedin report that the Alert was well known there as an island trader, and bore 3
an evil reputation along the waterfront. It was owned by a curious group of half- 3
castes whose frequent meetings and night trips to the woods attracted no little 3
curiosity; and it had set sail in great haste just after the storm and earth tremors 3
of March 1st. Our Auckland correspondent gives the Emma and her crew an 3
excellent reputation, and Johansen is described as a sober and worthy man. The 3
admiralty will institute an inquiry on the whole matter beginning tomorrow, at 3
which every effort will be made to induce Johansen to speak more freely than he 3
has done hitherto. 3
3
This was all, together with the picture of the hellish image; but what a train of 3
ideas it started in my mind! Here were new treasuries of data on the Cthulhu 3
Cult, and evidence that it had strange interests at sea as well as on land. What 3
motive prompted the hybrid crew to order back the Emma as they sailed about 3
with their hideous idol? What was the unknown island on which six of the 3
Emma's crew had died, and about which the mate Johansen was so secretive? 3
What had the vice-admiralty's investigation brought out, and what was known 3
of the noxious cult in Dunedin? And most marvellous of all, what deep and more 3
than natural linkage of dates was this which gave a malign and now undeniable 3
significance to the various turns of events so carefully noted by my uncle? 3
3
March 1st - or February 28th according to the International Date Line - the 3
earthquake and storm had come. From Dunedin the Alert and her noisome crew 3
had darted eagerly forth as if imperiously summoned, and on the other side of 3
3
3
3
290 3
3
3
3
the earth poets and artists had begun to dream of a strange, dank Cyclopean city 3
whilst a young sculptor had moulded in his sleep the form of the dreaded 3
Cthulhu. March 23rd the crew of the Emma landed on an unknown island and 3
left six men dead; and on that date the dreams of sensitive men assumed a 3
heightened vividness and darkened with dread of a giant monster's malign 3
pursuit, whilst an architect had gone mad and a sculptor had lapsed suddenly 3
into delirium! And what of this storm of April 2nd - the date on which all dreams 3
of the dank city ceased, and Wilcox emerged unharmed from the bondage of 3
strange fever? What of all this - and of those hints of old Castro about the 3
sunken, star-born Old Ones and their coming reign; their faithful cult and their 3
mastery of dreams? Was I tottering on the brink of cosmic horrors beyond man's 3
power to bear? If so, they must be horrors of the mind alone, for in some way the 3
second of April had put a stop to whatever monstrous menace had begun its 3
siege of mankind's soul. 3
3
That evening, after a day of hurried cabling and arranging, I bade my host adieu 3
and took a train for San Francisco. In less than a month I was in Dunedin; where, 3
however, I found that little was known of the strange cult-members who had 3
lingered in the old sea-taverns. Waterfront scum was far too common for special 3
mentnon; though there was vague talk about one inland trip these mongrels had 3
made, during which faint drumming and red flame were noted on the distant 3
hills. In Auckland I learned that Johansen had returned with yellow hair turned 3
white after a perfunctory and inconclusive questioning at Sydney, and had 3
thereafter sold his cottage in West Street and sailed with his wife to his old home 3
in Oslo. Of his stirring experience he would tell his friends no more than he had 3
told the admiralty officials, and all they could do was to give me his Oslo 3
address. 3
3
After that I went to Sydney and talked profitlessly with seamen and members of 3
the vice-admiralty court. I saw the Alert, now sold and in commercial use, at 3
Circular Quay in Sydney Cove, but gained nothing from its non-committal bulk. 3
The crouching image with its cuttlefish head, dragon body, scaly wings, and 3
hieroglyphed pedestal, was preserved in the Museum at Hyde Park; and I 3
studied it long and well, finding it a thing of balefully exquisite workmanship, 3
and with the same utter mystery, terrible antiquity, and unearthly strangeness of 3
material which I had noted in Legrasse's smaller specimen. Geologists, the 3
curator told me, had found it a monstrous puzzle; for they vowed that the world 3
held no rock like it. Then I thought with a shudder of what Old Castro had told 3
Legrasse about the Old Ones; "They had come from the stars, and had brought 3
Their images with Them." 3
3
Shaken with such a mental revolution as I had never before known, I now 3
resolved to visit Mate Johansen in Oslo. Sailing for London, I reembarked at once 3
3
3
3
291 3
3
3
3
for the Norwegian capital; and one autumn day landed at the trim wharves in 3
the shadow of the Egeberg. Johansen's address, I discovered, lay in the Old 3
Town of King Harold Haardrada, which kept alive the name of Oslo during all 3
the centuries that the greater city masqueraded as "Christiana." I made the brief 3
trip by taxicab, and knocked with palpitant heart at the door of a neat and 3
ancient building with plastered front. A sad-faced woman in black answered my 3
summons, and I was stung th disappointment when she told me in halting 3
English that Gustaf Johansen was no more. 3
3
He had not long survived his return, said his wife, for the doings sea in 1925 had 3
broken him. He had told her no more than he told the public, but had left a long 3
manuscript - of "technical matters" as he said - written in English, evidently in 3
order to guard her from the peril of casual perusal. During a walk rough a 3
narrow lane near the Gothenburg dock, a bundle of papers falling from an attic 3
window had knocked him down. Two Lascar sailors at once helped him to his 3
feet, but before the ambulance could reach him he was dead. Physicians found 3
no adequate cause the end, and laid it to heart trouble and a weakened 3
constitution. I now felt gnawing at my vitals that dark terror which will never 3
leave me till I, too, am at rest; "accidentally" or otherwise. Persuad-g the widow 3
that my connexion with her husband's "technical matters" was sufficient to 3
entitle me to his manuscript, I bore the document away and began to read it on 3
the London boat. 3
3
It was a simple, rambling thing - a naive sailor's effort at a post-facto diary - and 3
strove to recall day by day that last awful voyage. I cannot attempt to transcribe 3
it verbatim in all its cloudiness and redundance, but I will tell its gist enough to 3
shew why the sound the water against the vessel's sides became so unendurable 3
to me that I stopped my ears with cotton. 3
3
Johansen, thank God, did not know quite all, even though he saw the city and 3
the Thing, but I shall never sleep calmly again when I think of the horrors that 3
lurk ceaselessly behind life in time and in space, and of those unhallowed 3
blasphemies from elder stars which dream beneath the sea, known and favoured 3
by a nightmare cult ready and eager to loose them upon the world whenever 3
another earthquake shall heave their monstrous stone city again to the sun and 3
air. 3
3
Johansen's voyage had begun just as he told it to the vice-admiralty. The Emma, 3
in ballast, had cleared Auckland on February 20th, and had felt the full force of 3
that earthquake-born tempest which must have heaved up from the sea-bottom 3
the horrors that filled men's dreams. Once more under control, the ship was 3
making good progress when held up by the Alert on March 22nd, and I could 3
feel the mate's regret as he wrote of her bombardment and sinking. Of the 3
3
3
3
292 3
3
3
3
swarthy cult-fiends on the Alert he speaks with significant horror. There was 3
some peculiarly abominable quality about them which made their destruction 3
seem almost a duty, and Johansen shews ingenuous wonder at the charge of 3
ruthlessness brought against his party during the proceedings of the court of 3
inquiry. Then, driven ahead by curiosity in their captured yacht under 3
Johansen's command, the men sight a great stone pillar sticking out of the sea, 3
and in S. Latitude 47°9', W. Longitude 123°43', come upon a coastline of mingled 3
mud, ooze, and weedy Cyclopean masonry which can be nothing less than the 3
tangible substance of earth's supreme terror - the nightmare corpse-city of 3
R'lyeh, that was built in measureless aeons behind history by the vast, loathsome 3
shapes that seeped down from the dark stars. There lay great Cthulhu and his 3
hordes, hidden in green slimy vaults and sending out at last, after cycles 3
incalculable, the thoughts that spread fear to the dreams of the sensitive and 3
called imperiously to the faithfull to come on a pilgrimage of liberation and 3
restoration. All this Johansen did not suspect, but God knows he soon saw 3
enough! 3
3
I suppose that only a single mountain-top, the hideous monolith-crowned citadel 3
whereon great Cthulhu was buried, actually emerged from the waters. When I 3
think of the extent of all that may be brooding down there I almost wish to kill 3
myself forthwith. Johansen and his men were awed by the cosmic majesty of this 3
dripping Babylon of elder daemons, and must have guessed without guidance 3
that it was nothing of this or of any sane planet. Awe at the unbelievable size of 3
the greenish stone blocks, at the dizzying height of the great carven monolith, 3
and at the stupefying identity of the colossal statues and bas-reliefs with the 3
queer image found in the shrine on the Alert, is poignantly visible in every line 3
of the mates frightened description. 3
3
Without knowing what futurism is like, Johansen achieved something very close 3
to it when he spoke of the city; for instead of describing any definite structure or 3
building, he dwells only on broad impressions of vast angles and stone surfaces - 3
surfaces too great to belong to anything right or proper for this earth, and 3
impious with horrible images and hieroglyphs. I mention his talk about angles 3
because it suggests something Wilcox had told me of his awful dreams. He said 3
that the geometry of the dream-place he saw was abnormal, non-Euclidean, and 3
loathsomely redolent of spheres and dimensions apart from ours. Now an 3
unlettered seaman felt the same thing whilst gazing at the terrible reality. 3
3
Johansen and his men landed at a sloping mud-bank on this monstrous 3
Acropolis, and clambered slipperily up over titan oozy blocks which could have 3
been no mortal staircase. The very sun of heaven seemed distorted when viewed 3
through the polarising miasma welling out from this sea-soaked perversion, and 3
twisted menace and suspense lurked leeringly in those crazily elusive angles of 3
3
3
3
293 3
3
3
3
carven rock where a second glance shewed concavity after the first shewed 3
convexity. 3
3
Something very hke fright had come over all the explorers before anything more 3
definite than rock and ooze and weed was seen. Each would have fled had he not 3
feared the scorn of the others, and it was only half-heartedly that they searched - 3
vainly, as it proved - for some portable souvenir to bear away. 3
3
It was Rodriguez the Portuguese who climbed up the foot of the monolith and 3
shouted of what he had found. The rest followed him, and looked curiously at 3
the immense carved door with the now familiar squid-dragon bas-relief. It was, 3
Johansen said, like a great barn-door; and they all felt that it was a door because 3
of the ornate lintel, threshold, and jambs around it, though they could not decide 3
whether it lay flat like a trap-door or slantwise like an outside cellar-door. As 3
Wilcox would have said, the geometry of the place was all wrong. One could not 3
be sure that the sea and the ground were horizontal, hence the relative position 3
of everything else seemed phantasmally variable. 3
3
Briden pushed at the stone in several places without result. Then Donovan felt 3
over it delicately around the edge, pressing each point separately as he went. He 3
climbed interminably along the grotesque stone moulding - that is, one would 3
call it climbing if the thing was not after all horizontal - and the men wondered 3
how any door in the universe could be so vast. Then, very softly and slowly, the 3
acre-great lintel began to give inward at the top; and they saw that it was 3
balanced 3
3
Donovan slid or somehow propelled himself down or along the jamb and 3
rejoined his fellows, and everyone watched the queer recession of the 3
monstrously carven portal. In this phantasy of prismatic distortion it moved 3
anomalously in a diagonal way, so that all the rules of matter and perspective 3
seemed upset. 3
3
The aperture was black with a darkness almost material. That tenebrousness was 3
indeed a positive quality; for it obscured such parts of the inner walls as ought to 3
have been revealed, and actually burst forth like smoke from its aeon-long 3
imprisonment, visibly darkening the sun as it slunk away into the shrunken and 3
gibbous sky on flapping membraneous wings. The odour rising from the newly 3
opened depths was intolerable, and at length the quick-eared Hawkins thought 3
he heard a nasty, slopping sound down there. Everyone listened, and everyone 3
was listening still when It lumbered slobberingly into sight and gropingly 3
squeezed Its gelatinous green immensity through the black doorway into the 3
tainted outside air of that poison city of madness. 3
3
3
3
294 3
3
3
3
Poor Johansen's handwriting almost gave out when he wrote of this. Of the six 3
men who never reached the ship, he thinks two perished of pure fright in that 3
accursed instant. The Thing cannot be described - there is no language for such 3
abysms of shrieking and immemorial lunacy, such eldritch contradictions of all 3
matter, force, and cosmic order. A mountain walked or stumbled. God! What 3
wonder that across the earth a great architect went mad, and poor Wilcox raved 3
with fever in that telepathic instant? The Thing of the idols, the green, sticky 3
spawn of the stars, had awaked to claim his own. The stars were right again, and 3
what an age-old cult had failed to do by design, a band of innocent sailors had 3
done by accident. After vigintillions of years great Cthulhu was loose again, and 3
ravening for delight. 3
3
Three men were swept up by the flabby claws before anybody turned. God rest 3
them, if there be any rest in the universe. They were Donovan, Guerrera, and 3
Angstrom. Parker slipped as the other three were plunging frenziedly over 3
endless vistas of green-crusted rock to the boat, and Johansen swears he was 3
swallowed up by an angle of masonry which shouldn't have been there; an angle 3
which was acute, but behaved as if it were obtuse. So only Briden and Johansen 3
reached the boat, and pulled desperately for the Alert as the mountainous 3
monstrosity flopped down the slimy stones and hesitated, floundering at the 3
edge of the water. 3
3
Steam had not been suffered to go down entirely, despite the departure of all 3
hands for the shore; and it was the work of only a few moments of feverish 3
rushing up and down between wheel and engines to get the Alert under way. 3
Slowly, amidst the distorted horrors of that indescribable scene, she began to 3
churn the lethal waters; whilst on the masonry of that charnel shore that was not 3
of earth the titan Thing from the stars slavered and gibbered like Polypheme 3
cursing the fleeing ship of Odysseus. Then, bolder than the storied Cyclops, great 3
Cthulhu slid greasily into the water and began to pursue with vast wave-raising 3
strokes of cosmic potency. Briden looked back and went mad, laughing shrilly as 3
he kept on laughing at intervals till death found him one night in the cabin whilst 3
Johansen was wandering deliriously. 3
3
But Johansen had not given out yet. Knowing that the Thing could surely 3
overtake the Alert until steam was fully up, he resolved on a desperate chance; 3
and, setting the engine for full speed, ran lightning-like on deck and reversed the 3
wheel. There was a mighty eddying and foaming in the noisome brine, and as 3
the steam mounted higher and higher the brave Norwegian drove his vessel 3
head on against the pursuing jelly which rose above the unclean froth like the 3
stern of a daemon galleon. The awful squid-head with writhing feelers came 3
nearly up to the bowsprit of the sturdy yacht, but johansen drove on relentlessly. 3
There was a bursting as of an exploding bladder, a slushy nastiness as of a cloven 3
3
3
3
295 3
3
3
3
sunfish, a stench as of a thousand opened graves, and a sound that the chronicler 3
could not put on paper. For an instant the ship was befouled by an acrid and 3
blinding green cloud, and then there was only a venomous seething astern; 3
where - God in heaven! - the scattered plasticity of that nameless sky-spawn was 3
nebulously recombining in its hateful original form, whilst its distance widened 3
every second as the Alert gained impetus from its mounting steam. 3
3
That was all. After that Johansen only brooded over the idol in the cabin and 3
attended to a few matters of food for himself and the laughing maniac by his 3
side. He did not try to navigate after the first bold flight, for the reaction had 3
taken something out of his soul. Then came the storm of April 2nd, and a 3
gathering of the clouds about his consciousness. There is a sense of spectral 3
whirling through liquid gulfs of infinity, of dizzying rides through reeling 3
universes on a comets tail, and of hysterical plunges from the pit to the moon 3
and from the moon back again to the pit, all livened by a cachinnating chorus of 3
the distorted, hilarious elder gods and the green, bat-winged mocking imps of 3
Tartarus. 3
3
Out of that dream came rescue-the Vigilant, the vice-admiralty court, the streets 3
of Dunedin, and the long voyage back home to the old house by the Egeberg. He 3
could not tell - they would think him mad. He would write of what he knew 3
before death came, but his wife must not guess. Death would be a boon if only it 3
could blot out the memories. 3
3
That was the document I read, and now I have placed it in the tin box beside the 3
bas-relief and the papers of Professor Angell. With it shall go this record of mine 3
- this test of my own sanity, wherein is pieced together that which I hope may 3
never be pieced together again. I have looked upon all that the universe has to 3
hold of horror, and even the skies of spring and the flowers of summer must ever 3
afterward be poison to me. But I do not think my life will be long. As my uncle 3
went, as poor Johansen went, so I shall go. I know too much, and the cult still 3
lives. 3
3
Cthulhu still lives, too, I suppose, again in that chasm of stone which has 3
shielded him since the sun was young. His accursed city is sunken once more, for 3
the Vigilant sailed over the spot after the April storm; but his ministers on earth 3
still bellow and prance and slay around idol-capped monoliths in lonely places. 3
He must have been trapped by the sinking whilst within his black abyss, or else 3
the world would by now be screaming with fright and frenzy. Who knows the 3
end? What has risen may sink, and what has sunk may rise. Loathsomeness 3
waits and dreams in the deep, and decay spreads over the tottering cities of men. 3
A time will come - but I must not and cannot think! Let me pray that, if I do not 3
3

survive this manuscript, my executors may put caution before audacity and see 3
that it meets no other eye. 3

3
From a private hospital for the insane near Providence, Rhode Island, there 3
recently disappeared an exceedingly singular person. He bore the name of 3
Charles Dexter Ward, and was placed under restraint most reluctantly by the 3
grieving father who had watched his aberration grow from a mere eccentricity to 3
a dark mania involving both a possibility of murderous tendencies and a 3
profound and peculiar change in the apparent contents of his mind. Doctors 3
confess themselves quite baffled by his case, since it presented oddities of a 3
general physiological as well as psychological character. 3
3
In the first place, the patient seemed oddly older than his twenty-six years would 3
warrant. Mental disturbance, it is true, will age one rapidly; but the face of this 3
young man had taken on a subtle cast which only the very aged normally 3
acquire. In the second place, his organic processes shewed a certain queerness of 3
proportion which nothing in medical experience can parallel. Respiration and 3
heart action had a baffling lack of symmetry; the voice was lost, so that no 3
sounds above a whisper were possible; digestion was incredibly prolonged and 3
minimised, and neural reactions to standard stimuli bore no relation at all to 3
anything heretofore recorded, either normal or pathological. The skin had a 3
morbid chill and dryness, and the cellular structure of the tissue seemed 3
exaggeratedly coarse and loosely knit. Even a large olive birthmark on the right 3
hip had disappeared, whilst there had formed on the chest a very peculiar mole 3
or blackish spot of which no trace existed before. In general, all physicians agree 3
that in Ward the processes of metabolism had become retarded to a degree 3
beyond precedent. 3
3
3
3
298 3
3
3
3
Psychologically, too, Charles Ward was unique. His madness held no affinity to 3
any sort recorded in even the latest and most exhaustive of treatises, and was 3
conjoined to a mental force which would have made him a genius or a leader had 3
it not been twisted into strange and grotesque forms. Dr. Willett, who was 3
Ward's family physician, affirms that the patient's gross mental capacity, as 3
gauged by his response to matters outside the sphere of his insanity, had actually 3
increased since the seizure. Ward, it is true, was always a scholar and an 3
antiquarian; but even his most brilliant early work did not shew the prodigious 3
grasp and insight displayed during his last examinations by the alienists. It was, 3
indeed, a difficult matter to obtain a legal commitment to the hospital, so 3
powerful and lucid did the youth's mind seem; and only on the evidence of 3
others, and on the strength of many abnormal gaps in his stock of information as 3
distinguished from his intelligence, was he finally placed in confinement. To the 3
very moment of his vanishment he was an omnivorous reader and as great a 3
conversationalist as his poor voice permitted; and shrewd observers, failing to 3
foresee his escape, freely predicted that he would not be long in gaining his 3
discharge from custody. 3
3
Only Dr. Willett, who brought Charles Ward into the world and had watched his 3
growth of body and mind ever since, seemed frightened at the thought of his 3
future freedom. He had had a terrible experience and had made a terrible 3
discovery which he dared not reveal to his sceptical colleagues. Willett, indeed, 3
presents a minor mystery all his own in his connexion with the case. He was the 3
last to see the patient before his flight, and emerged from that final conversation 3
in a state of mixed horror and relief which several recalled when Ward's escape 3
became known three hours later. That escape itself is one of the unsolved 3
wonders of Dr. Waite's hospital. A window open above a sheer drop of sixty feet 3
could hardly explain it, yet after that talk with Willett the youth was undeniably 3
gone. Willett himself has no public explanations to offer, though he seems 3
strangely easier in mind than before the escape. Many, indeed, feel that he would 3
like to say more if he thought any considerable number would believe him. He 3
had found Ward in his room, but shortly after his departure the attendants 3
knocked in vain. When they opened the door the patient was not there, and all 3
they found was the open window with a chill April breeze blowing in a cloud of 3
fine bluish-grey dust that almost choked them. True, the dogs howled some time 3
before; but that was while Willett was still present, and they had caught nothing 3
and shewn no disturbance later on. Ward's father was told at once over the 3
telephone, but he seemed more saddened than surprised. By the time Dr. Waite 3
called in person. Dr. Willett had been talking with him, and both disavowed any 3
knowledge or complicity in the escape. Only from certain closely confidential 3
friends of Willett and the senior Ward have any clues been gained, and even 3
these are too wildly fantastic for general credence. The one fact which remains is 3
that up to the present time no trace of the missing madman has been unearthed. 3

3
Charles Ward was an antiquarian from infancy, no doubt gaining his taste from 3
the venerable town around him, and from the relics of the past which filled every 3
corner of his parents' old mansion in Prospect Street on the crest of the hill. With 3
the years his devotion to ancient things increased; so that history, genealogy, and 3
the study of colonial architecture, furniture, and craftsmanship at length 3
crowded everything else from his sphere of interests. These tastes are important 3
to remember in considering his madness; for although they do not form its 3
absolute nucleus, they play a prominent part in its superficial form. The gaps of 3
information which the alienists noticed were all related to modern matters, and 3
were invariably offset by a correspondingly excessive though outwardly 3
concealed knowledge of bygone matters as brought out by adroit questioning; so 3
that one would have fancied the patient literally transferred to a former age 3
through some obscure sort of auto-hypnosis. The odd thing was that Ward 3
seemed no longer interested in the antiquities he knew so well. He had, it 3
appears, lost his regard for them through sheer familiarity; and all his final 3
efforts were obviously bent toward mastering those common facts of the modern 3
world which had been so totally and unmistakably expunged from his brain. 3
That this wholesale deletion had occurred, he did his best to hide; but it was clear 3
to all who watched him that his whole programme of reading and conversation 3
was determined by a frantic wish to imbibe such knowledge of his own life and 3
of the ordinary practical and cultural background of the twentieth century as 3
ought to have been his by virtue of his birth in 1902 and his education in the 3
schools of our own time. Alienists are now wondering how, in view of his vitally 3
impaired range of data, the escaped patient manages to cope with the 3
complicated world of today; the dominant opinion being that he is "lying low" in 3
some humble and unexacting position till his stock of modern information can be 3
brought up to the normal. 3
3
The beginning of Ward's madness is a matter of dispute among alienists. Dr. 3
Lyman, the eminent Boston authority, places it in 1919 or 1920, during the boy's 3
last year at the Moses Brown School, when he suddenly turned from the study of 3
the past to the study of the occult, and refused to qualify for college on the 3
ground that he had individual researches of much greater importance to make. 3
This is certainly borne out by Ward's altered habits at the time, especially by his 3
continual search through town records and among old burying-grounds for a 3
certain grave dug in 1771; the grave of an ancestor named Joseph Curwen, some 3
of whose papers he professed to have found behind the panelling of a very old 3
house in Olney Court, on Stampers' Hill, which Curwen was known to have 3
built and occupied. It is, broadly speaking, undeniable that the winter of 1919-20 3
saw a great change in Ward; whereby he abruptly stopped his general 3
antiquarian pursuits and embarked on a desperate delving into occult subjects 3
both at home and abroad, varied only by this strangely persistent search for his 3
forefather's grave. 3
3
3
3
300 3
3
3
3
From this opinion, however. Dr. Willett substantially dissents; basing his verdict 3
on his close and continuous knowledge of the patient, and on certain frightful 3
investigations and discoveries which he made toward the last. Those 3
investigations and discoveries have left their mark upon him; so that his voice 3
trembles when he tells them, and his hand trembles when he tries to write of 3
them. Willett admits that the change of 1919-20 would ordinarily appear to mark 3
the beginning of a progressive decadence which culminated in the horrible and 3
uncanny alienation of 1928; but believes from personal observation that a finer 3
distinction must be made. Granting freely that the boy was always ill-balanced 3
temperamentally, and prone to be unduly susceptible and enthusiastic in his 3
responses to phenomena around him, he refuses to concede that the early 3
alteration marked the actual passage from sanity to madness; crediting instead 3
Ward's own statement that he had discovered or rediscovered something whose 3
effect on human though was likely to be marvellous and profound. The true 3
madness, he is certain, came with a later change; after the Curwen portrait and 3
the ancient papers had been unearthed; after a trip to strange foreign places had 3
been made, and some terrible invocations chanted under strange and secret 3
circumstances; after certain answers to these invocations had been plainly 3
indicated, and a frantic letter penned under agonising and inexplicable 3
conditions; after the wave of vampirism and the ominous Pawtuxet gossip; and 3
after the patient's memory commenced to exclude contemporary images whilst 3
his physical aspect underwent the subtle modification so many subsequently 3
noticed. 3
3
It was only about this time, Willett points out with much acuteness, that the 3
nightmare qualities became indubitably linked with Ward; and the doctor feels 3
shudderingly sure that enough solid evidence exists to sustain the youth's claim 3
regarding his crucial discovery. In the first place, two workmen of high 3
intelligence saw Joseph Curwen's ancient papers found. Secondly, the boy once 3
shewed Dr. Willett those papers and a page of the Curwen diary, and each of the 3
documents had every appearance of genuineness. The hole where Ward claimed 3
to have found them was long a visible reality, and Willett had a very convincing 3
final glimpse of them in surroundings which can scarcely be believed and can 3
never perhaps be proved. Then there were the mysteries and coincidences of the 3
Orne and Hutchinson letters, and the problem of the Curwen penmanship and of 3
what the detectives brought to light about Dr. Allen; these things, and the terrible 3
message in mediaeval minuscules found in Willett's pocket when he gained 3
consciousness after his shocking experience. 3
3
And most conclusive of all, there are the two hideous results which the doctor 3
obtained from a certain pair of formulae during his final investigations; results 3
which virtually proved the authenticity of the papers and of their monstrous 3
3
3
3
301 3
3
3
3
implications at the same time that those papers were borne forever from human 3
knowledge. 3
3
3
3
One must look back at Charles Ward's earlier life as at something belonging as 3
much to the past as the antiquities he loved so keenly. In the autumn of 1918, and 3
with a considerable show of zest in the military training of the period, he had 3
begun his junior year at the Moses Brown School, which lies very near his home. 3
The old main building, erected in 1819, had always charmed his youthful 3
antiquarian sense; and the spacious park in which the academy is set appealed to 3
his sharp eye for landscape. His social activities were few; and his hours were 3
spent mainly at home, in rambling walks, in his classes and drills, and in pursuit 3
of antiquarian and genealogical data at the City Hall, the State House, the Public 3
Library, the Athenaeum, the Historical Society, the John Carter Brown and John 3
Hay Libraries of Brown University, and the newly opened Shepley Library in 3
Benefit Street. One may picture him yet as he was in those days; tall, slim, and 3
blond, with studious eyes and a slight droop, dressed somewhat carelessly, and 3
giving a dominant impression of harmless awkwardness rather than 3
attractiveness. 3
3
His walks were always adventures in antiquity, during which he managed to 3
recapture from the myriad relics of a glamorous old city a vivid and connected 3
picture of the centuries before. His home was a great Georgian mansion atop the 3
well-nigh precipitous hill that rises just east of the river; and from the rear 3
windows of its rambling wings he could look dizzily out over all the clustered 3
spires, domes, roofs, and skyscraper summits of the lower town to the purple 3
hills of the countryside beyond. Here he was born, and from the lovely classic 3
porch of the double-bayed brick facade his nurse had first wheeled him in his 3
carriage; past the little white farmhouse of two hundred years before that the 3
town had long ago overtaken, and on toward the stately colleges along the 3
shady, sumptuous street, whose old square brick mansions and smaller wooden 3
houses with narrow, heavy-columned Doric porches dreamed solid and 3
exclusive amidst their generous yards and gardens. 3
3
He had been wheeled, too, along sleepy Congdon Street, one tier lower down on 3
the steep hill, and with all its eastern homes on high terraces. The small wooden 3
houses averaged a greater age here, for it was up this hill that the growing town 3
had climbed; and in these rides he had imbibed something of the colour of a 3
quaint colonial village. The nurse used to stop and sit on the benches of Prospect 3
Terrace to chat with policemen; and one of the child's first memories was of the 3
great westward sea of hazy roofs and domes and steeples and far hills which he 3
saw one winter afternoon from that great railed embankment, and violet and 3
3
3
3
302 3
3
3
3
mystic against a fevered, apocalyptic sunset of reds and golds and purples and 3
curious greens. The vast marble dome of the State House stood out in massive 3
silhouette, its crowning statue haloed fantastically by a break in one of the tinted 3
stratus clouds that barred the flaming sky. 3
3
When he was larger his famous walks began; first with his impatiently dragged 3
nurse, and then alone in dreamy meditation. Farther and farther down that 3
almost perpendicular hill he would venture, each time reaching older and 3
quainter levels of the ancient city. He would hesitate gingerly down vertical 3
Jenckes Street with its bank walls and colonial gables to the shady Benefit Street 3
corner, where before him was a wooden antique with an lonic-pilastered pair of 3
doorways, and beside him a prehistoric gambrel-roofer with a bit of primal 3
farmyard remaining, and the great Judge Durfee house with its fallen vestiges of 3
Georgian grandeur. It was getting to be a slum here; but the titan elms cast a 3
restoring shadow over the place, and the boy used to stroll south past the long 3
lines of the pre-Revolutionary homes with their great central chimneys and 3
classic portals. On the eastern side they were set high over basements with railed 3
double flights of stone steps, and the young Charles could picture them as they 3
were when the street was new, and red heels and periwigs set off the painted 3
pediments whose signs of wear were now becoming so visible. 3
3
Westward the hill dropped almost as steeply as above, down to the old "Town 3
Street" that the founders had laid out at the river's edge in 1636. Here ran 3
innumerable little lanes with leaning, huddled houses of immense antiquity; and 3
fascinated though he was, it was long before he dared to thread their archaic 3
verticality for fear they would turn out a dream or a gateway to unknown 3
terrors. He found it much less formidable to continue along Benefit Street past 3
the iron fence of St. John's hidden churchyard and the rear of the 1761 Colony 3
House and the mouldering bulk of the Golden Ball Inn where Washington 3
stopped. At Meeting Street - the successive Gaol Lane and King Street of other 3
periods - he would look upward to the east and see the arched flight of steps to 3
which the highway had to resort in climbing the slope, and downward to the 3
west, glimpsing the old brick colonial schoolhouse that smiles across the road at 3
the ancient Sign of Shakespeare's Head where the Providence Gazette and 3
Country-Journal was printed before the Revolution. Then came the exquisite 3
First Baptist Church of 1775, luxurious with its matchless Gibbs steeple, and the 3
Georgian roofs and cupolas hovering by. Here and to the southward the 3
neighbourhood became better, flowering at last into a marvellous group of early 3
mansions; but still the little ancient lanes led off down the precipice to the west, 3
spectral in their many-gabled archaism and dipping to a riot of iridescent decay 3
where the wicked old water-front recalls its proud East India days amidst 3
polyglot vice and squalor, rotting wharves, and blear-eyed ship-chandleries. 3
3
3
3
303 3
3
3
3
with such surviving alley names as Packet, Bullion, Gold, Silver, Coin, Doubloon, 3
Sovereign, Guilder, Dollar, Dime, and Cent. 3
3
Sometimes, as he grew taller and more adventurous, young Ward would venture 3
down into this maelstrom of tottering houses, broken transoms, tumbling steps, 3
twisted balustrades, swarthy faces, and nameless odours; winding from South 3
Main to South Water, searching out the docks where the bay and sound steamers 3
still touched, and returning northward at this lower level past the steep-roofed 3
1816 warehouses and the broad square at the Great Bridge, where the 1773 3
Market House still stands firm on its ancient arches. In that square he would 3
pause to drink in the bewildering beauty of the old town as it rises on its 3
eastward bluff, decked with its two Georgian spires and crowned by the vast 3
new Christian Science dome as London is crowned by St. Paul's. He like mostly 3
to reach this point in the late afternoon, when the slanting sunlight touches the 3
Market House and the ancient hill roofs and belfries with gold, and throws 3
magic around the dreaming wharves where Providence Indiamen used to ride at 3
anchor. After a long look he would grow almost dizzy with a poet's love for the 3
sight, and then he would scale the slope homeward in the dusk past the old 3
white church and up the narrow precipitous ways where yellow gleams would 3
begin to peep out in small-paned windows and through fanlights set high over 3
double flights of steps with curious wrought-iron railings. 3
3
At other times, and in later years, he would seek for vivid contrasts; spending 3
half a walk in the crumbling colonial regions northwest of his home, where the 3
hill drops to the lower eminence of Stampers' Hill with its ghetto and negro 3
quarter clustering round the place where the Boston stage coach used to start 3
before the Revolution, and the other half in the gracious southerly realm about 3
George, Benevolent, Power, and Williams Streets, where the old slope holds 3
unchanged the fine estates and bits of walled garden and steep green lane in 3
which so many fragrant memories linger. These rambles, together with the 3
diligent studies which accompanied them, certainly account for a large amount 3
of the antiquarian lore which at last crowded the modern world from Charles 3
Ward's mind; and illustrate the mental soil upon which fell, in that fateful winter 3
of 1919-20, the seeds that came to such strange and terrible fruition. 3
3
Dr. Willett is certain that, up to this ill-omened winter of first change, Charles 3
Ward's antiquarianism was free from every trace of the morbid. Graveyards held 3
for him no particular attraction beyond their quaintness and historic value, and 3
of anything like violence or savage instinct he was utterly devoid. Then, by 3
insidious degrees, there appeared to develop a curious sequel to one of his 3
genealogical triumphs of the year before; when he had discovered among his 3
maternal ancestors a certain very long-lived man named Joseph Curwen, who 3
3
3
3
304 3
3
3
3
had come from Salem in March of 1692, and about whom a whispered series of 3
highly peculiar and disquieting stories clustered. 3
3
Ward's great-great-grandfather Welcome Potter had in 1785 married a certain 3
'Ann Tillinghast, daughter of Mrs. Eliza, daughter to Capt. James Tillinghast,' of 3
whose paternity the family had preserved no trace. Late in 1918, whilst 3
examining a volume of original town records in manuscript, the young 3
genealogist encountered an entry describing a legal change of name, by which in 3
1772 a Mrs. Eliza Curwen, widow of Joseph Curwen, resumed, along with her 3
seven-year-old daughter Ann, her maiden name of Tillinghast; on the ground 3
'that her Husband's name was become a public Reproach by Reason of what was 3
knowne after his Decease; the which confirming an antient common Rumour, 3
tho' not to be credited by a loyall Wife till so proven as to be wholely past 3
Doubting.' 3
3
This entry came to light upon the accidental separation of two leaves which had 3
been carefully pasted together and treated as one by a laboured revision of the 3
page numbers. 3
3
It was at once clear to Charles Ward that he had indeed discovered a hitherto 3
unknown great-great-great-grandfather. The discovery doubly excited him 3
because he had already heard vague reports and seen scattered allusions relating 3
to this person; about whom there remained so few publicly available records, 3
aside from those becoming public only in modern times, that it almost seemed as 3
if a conspiracy had existed to blot him from memory. What did appear, 3
moreover, was of such a singular and provocative nature that one could not fail 3
to imagine curiously what it was that the colonial recorders were so anxious to 3
conceal and forget; or to suspect that the deletion had reasons all too valid. 3
3
Before this. Ward had been content to let his romancing about old Joseph 3
Curwen remain in the idle stage; but having discovered his own relationship to 3
this apparently "hushed-up" character, he proceeded to hunt out as 3
systematically as possible whatever he might find concerning him. In this excited 3
quest he eventually succeeded beyond his highest expectations; for old letters, 3
diaries, and sheaves of unpublished memoirs in cobwebbed Providence garrets 3
and elsewhere yielded many illuminating passages which their writers had not 3
thought it worth their while to destroy. One important sidelight came from a 3
point as remote as New York, where some Rhode Island colonial correspondence 3
was stored in the Museum at Fraunces' Tavern. The really crucial thing, though, 3
and what in Dr, Willett's opinion formed the definite source of Ward's undoing, 3
was the matter found in August 1919 behind the panelling of the crumbling 3
house in Olney Court. It was that, beyond a doubt, which opened up those black 3
vistas whose end was deeper than the pit. 3
3

3
3
II. An Antecedent and a Horror 3
3
3
3
Joseph Curwen, as revealed by the rambhng legends embodied in what Ward 3
heard and unearthed, was a very astonishing, enigmatic, and obscurely horrible 3
individual. He had fled from Salem to Providence - that universal haven of the 3
odd, the free, and the dissenting - at the beginning of the great witchcraft panic; 3
being in fear of accusation because of his solitary ways and queer chemical or 3
alchemical experiments. He was a colourless-looking man of about thirty, and 3
was soon found qualified to become a freeman of Providence; thereafter buying a 3
home lot just north of Gregory Dexter's at about the foot of Olney Street. His 3
house was built on Stampers' Hill west of the Town Street, in what later became 3
Olney Court; and in 1761 he replaced this with a larger one, on the same site, 3
which is still standing. 3
3
Now the first odd thing about Joseph Curwen was that he did not seem to grow 3
much older than he had been on his arrival. He engaged in shipping enterprises, 3
purchased wharfage near Mile-End Cove, helped rebuild the Great Bridge in 3
1713, and in 1723 was one of the founders of the Congregational Church on the 3
hill; but always did he retain his nondescript aspect of a man not greatly over 3
thirty or thirty-five. As decades mounted up, this singular quality began to excite 3
wide notice; but Curwen always explained it by saying that he came of hardy 3
forefathers, and practised a simplicity of living which did not wear him our. 3
How such simplicity could be reconciled with the inexplicable comings and 3
goings of the secretive merchant, and with the queer gleaming of his windows at 3
all hours of night, was not very clear to the townsfolk; and they were prone to 3
assign other reasons for his continued youth and longevity. It was held, for the 3
most part, that Curwen's incessant mixings and boilings of chemicals had much 3
to do with his condition. Gossip spoke of the strange substances he brought from 3
London and the Indies on his ships or purchased in Newport, Boston, and New 3
York; and when old Dr. Jabez Bowen came from Rehoboth and opened his 3
apothecary shop across the Great Bridge at the Sign of the Unicorn and Mortar, 3
there was ceaseless talk of the drugs, acids, and metals that the taciturn recluse 3
incessantly bought or ordered from him. Acting on the assumption that Curwen 3
possessed a wondrous and secret medical skill, many sufferers of various sorts 3
applied to him for aid; but though he appeared to encourage their belief in a non- 3
committal way, and always gave them odd-coloured potions in response to their 3
requests, it was observed that his ministrations to others seldom proved of 3
benefit. At length, when over fifty years had passed since the stranger's advent, 3
and without producing more than five years' apparent change in his face and 3
physique, the people began to whisper more darkly; and to meet more than half 3
way that desire for isolation which he had always shewn. 3
3
3
3
306 3
3
3
3
Private letters and diaries of the period reveal, too, a multitude of other reasons 3
why Joseph Curwen was marvelled at, feared, and finally shunned like a plague. 3
His passion for graveyards, in which he was glimpsed at all hours, and under all 3
conditions, was notorious; though no one had witnessed any deed on his part 3
which could actually be termed ghoulish. On the Pawtuxet Road he had a farm, 3
at which he generally lived during the summer, and to which he would 3
frequently be seen riding at various odd times of the day or night. Here his only 3
visible servants, farmers, and caretakers were a sullen pair of aged Narragansett 3
Indians; the husband dumb and curiously scarred, and the wife of a very 3
repulsive cast of countenance, probably due to a mixture of negro blood. In the 3
lead-to of this house was the laboratory where most of the chemical experiments 3
were conducted. Curious porters and teamers who delivered bottles, bags, or 3
boxes at the small read door would exchange accounts of the fantastic flasks, 3
crucibles, alembics, and furnaces they saw in the low shelved room; and 3
prophesied in whispers that the close-mouthed "chymist" - by which they meant 3
alchemist - would not be long in finding the Philosopher's Stone. The nearest 3
neighbours to this farm - the Fenners, a quarter of a mile away - had still queerer 3
things to tell of certain sounds which they insisted came from the Curwen place 3
in the night. There were cries, they said, and sustained bowlings; and they did 3
not like the large numbers of livestock which thronged the pastures, for no such 3
amount was needed to keep a lone old man and a very few servants in meat, 3
milk, and wool. The identity of the stock seemed to change from week to week as 3
new droves were purchased from the Kingstown farmers. Then, too, there was 3
something very obnoxious about a certain great stone outbuilding with only high 3
narrow slits for windows. 3
3
Great Bridge idlers likewise had much to say of Curwen's town house in Olney 3
Court; not so much the fine new one built in 1761, when the man must have been 3
nearly a century old, but the first low gambrel-roofed one with the windowless 3
attic and shingled sides, whose timbers he took the peculiar precaution of 3
burning after its demolition. Here there was less mystery, it is true; but the hours 3
at which lights were seen, the secretiveness of the two swarthy foreigners who 3
comprised the only menservants, the hideous indistinct mumbling of the 3
incredibly aged French housekeeper, the large amounts of food seen to enter a 3
door within which only four persons lived, and the quality of certain voices often 3
heard in muffled conversation at highly unseasonable times, all combined with 3
what was known of the Pawtuxet farm to give the place a bad name. 3
3
In choicer circles, too, the Curwen home was by no means undiscussed; for as the 3
newcomer had gradually worked into the church and trading life of the town, he 3
had naturally made acquaintances of the better sort, whose company and 3
conversation he was well fitted by education to enjoy. His birth was known to be 3
good, since the Curwens or Corwins of Salem needed no introduction in New 3
3
3
3
307 3
3
3
3
England. It developed that Joseph Curwen had travelled much in very early life, 3
living for a time in England and making at least two voyages to the Orient; and 3
his speech, when he deigned to use it, was that of a learned and cultivated 3
Englishman. But for some reason or other Curwen did not care for society. 3
Whilst never actually rebuffing a visitor, he always reared such a wall of reserve 3
that few could think of anything to say to him which would not sound inane. 3
3
There seemed to lurk in his bearing some cryptic, sardonic arrogance, as if he 3
had come to find all human beings dull though having moved among stranger 3
and more potent entities. When Dr. Checkley the famous wit came from Boston 3
in 1738 to be rector of King's Church, he did not neglect calling on one of whom 3
he soon heard so much; but left in a very short while because of some sinister 3
undercurrent he detected in his host's discourse. Charles Ward told his father, 3
when they discussed Curwen one winter evening, that he would give much to 3
learn what the mysterious old man had said to the sprightly cleric, but that all 3
diarists agree concerning Dr. Checkley's reluctance to repeat anything he had 3
heard. The good man had been hideously shocked, and could never recall Joseph 3
Curwen without a visible loss of the gay urbanity for which he was famed. 3
3
More definite, however, was the reason why another man of taste and breeding 3
avoided the haughty hermit. In 1746 Mr. John Merritt, an elderly English 3
gentleman of literary and scientific leanings, came from Newport to the town 3
which was so rapidly overtaking it in standing, and built a fine country seat on 3
the Neck in what is now the heart of the best residence section. He lived in 3
considerable style and comfort, keeping the first coach and liveried servants in 3
town, and taking great pride in his telescope, his microscope, and his well- 3
chosen library of English and Latin books. Hearing of Curwen as the owner of 3
the best library in Providence, Mr. Merritt early paid him a call, and was more 3
cordially received than most other callers at the house had been. His admiration 3
for his host's ample shelves, which besides the Greek, Latin, and English classics 3
were equipped with a remarkable battery of philosophical, mathematical, and 3
scientific works including Paracelsus, Agricola, Van Helmont, Sylvius, Glauber, 3
Boyle, Boerhaave, Becher, and Stahl, led Curwen to suggest a visit to the 3
farmhouse and laboratory whither he had never invited anyone before; and the 3
two drove out at once in Mr. Merritt's coach. 3
3
Mr. Merritt always confessed to seeing nothing really horrible at the farmhouse, 3
but maintained that the titles of the books in the special library of 3
thaumaturgical, alchemical, and theological subjects which Curwen kept in a 3
front room were alone sufficient to inspire him with a lasting loathing. Perhaps, 3
however, the facial expression of the owner in exhibiting them contributed much 3
of the prejudice. This bizarre collection, besides a host of standard works which 3
Mr. Merritt was not too alarmed to envy, embraced nearly all the cabbalists. 3
3
3
3
308 3
3
3
3
daemonologists, and magicians known to man; and was a treasure-house of lore 3
in the doubtful realms of alchemy and astrology. Hermes Trismegistus in 3
Mesnard's edition, the Turba Philosophorum, Geber's Liber Investigationis, and 3
Artephius's Key of Wisdom all were there; with the cabbalistic Zohar, Peter 3
Jammy's set of Albertus Magnus, Raymond Lully's Ars Magna et Ultima in 3
Zetsner's edition, Roger Bacon's Thesaurus Chemicus, Fludd's Clavis Alchimiae, 3
and Trithemius's De Lapide Philosophico crowding them close. Mediaeval Jews 3
and Arabs were represented in profusion, and Mr. Merritt turned pale when, 3
upon taking down a fine volume conspicuously labelled as the Qanoon-e-Islam, 3
he found it was in truth the forbidden Necronomicon of the mad Arab Abdul 3
Alhazred, of which he had heard such monstrous things whispered some years 3
previously after the exposure of nameless rites at the strange little fishing village 3
of Kingsport, in the province of the Massachussetts-Bay. 3
3
But oddly enough, the worthy gentleman owned himself most impalpably 3
disquieted by a mere minor detail. On the huge mahogany table there lay face 3
downwards a badly worn copy of Borellus, bearing many cryptical marginalia 3
and interlineations in Curwen's hand. The book was open at about its middle, 3
and one paragraph displayed such thick and tremulous pen-strokes beneath the 3
lines of mystic black-letter that the visitor could not resist scanning it through. 3
Whether it was the nature of the passage underscored, or the feverish heaviness 3
of the strokes which formed the underscoring, he could not tell; but something in 3
that combination affected him very badly and very peculiarly. He recalled it to 3
the end of his days, writing it down from memory in his diary and once trying to 3
recite it to his close friend Dr. Checkley till he saw how greatly it disturbed the 3
urbane rector. It read: 3
3
'The essential Saltes of Animals may be so prepared and preserved, that an 3
ingenious Man may have the whole Ark of Noah in his own Studie, and raise the 3
fine Shape of an Animal out of its Ashes at his Pleasure; and by the lyke Method 3
from the essential Saltes of humane Dust, a Philosopher may, without any 3
criminal Necromancy, call up the Shape of any dead Ancestour from the Dust 3
whereinto his Bodie has been incinerated.' 3
3
It was near the docks along the southerly part of the Town Street, however, that 3
the worst things were muttered about Joseph Curwen. Sailors are superstitious 3
folk; and the seasoned salts who manned the infinite rum, slave, and molasses 3
sloops, the rakish privateers, and the great brigs of the Browns, Crawfords, and 3
Tillinghasts, all made strange furtive signs of protection when they saw the slim, 3
deceptively young-looking figure with its yellow hair and slight stoop entering 3
the Curwen warehouse in Doubloon Street or talking with captains and 3
supercargoes on the long quay where the Curwen ships rode restlessly. 3
Curwen's own clerks and captains hated and feared him, and all his sailors were 3
3
3
3
309 3
3
3
3
mongrel riff-raff from Martinique, St. Eustatius, Havana, or Port Royal. It was, in 3
a way, the frequency with which these sailors were replaced which inspired the 3
acutest and most tangible part of the fear in which the old man was held. A crew 3
would be turned loose in the town on shore leave, some of its members perhaps 3
charged with this errand or that; and when reassembled it would be almost sure 3
to lack one or more men. That many of the errands had concerned the farm of 3
Pawtuxet Road, and that few of the sailors had ever been seen to return from that 3
place, was not forgotten; so that in time it became exceedingly difficult for 3
Curwen to keep his oddly assorted hands. Almost invariably several would 3
desert soon after hearing the gossip of the Providence wharves, and their 3
replacement in the West Indies became an increasingly great problem to the 3
merchant. 3
3
By 1760 Joseph Curwen was virtually an outcast, suspected of vague horrors and 3
daemoniac alliances which seemed all the more menacing because they could not 3
be named, understood, or even proved to exist. The last straw may have come 3
from the affair of the missing soldiers in 1758, for in March and April of that year 3
two Royal regiments on their way to New France were quartered in Providence, 3
and depleted by an inexplicable process far beyond the average rate of desertion. 3
Rumour dwelt on the frequency with which Curwen was wont to be seen talking 3
with the red-coated strangers; and as several of them began to be missed, people 3
thought of the odd conditions among his own seamen. What would have 3
happened if the regiments had not been ordered on, no one can tell. 3
3
Meanwhile the merchant's worldly affairs were prospering. He had a virtual 3
monopoly of the town's trade in saltpetre, black pepper, and cinnamon, and 3
easily led any other one shipping establishment save the Browns in his 3
importation of brassware, indigo, cotton, woollens, salt, rigging, iron, paper, and 3
English goods of every kind. Such shopkeepers as James Green, at the Sign of the 3
Elephant in Cheapside, the Russells, at the Sign of the Golden Eagle across the 3
Bridge, or Clark and Nightingale at the Frying-Pan and Fish near New Coffee- 3
House, depended almost wholly upon him for their stock; and his arrangements 3
with the local distillers, the Narragansett dairymen and horse-breeders, and the 3
Newport candle-makers, made him one of the prime exporters of the Colony. 3
3
Ostracised though he was, he did not lack for civic spirit of a sort. When the 3
Colony House burned down, he subscribed handsomely to the lotteries by which 3
the new brick one - still standing at the head of its parade in the old main street - 3
was built in 1761. In that same year, too, he helped rebuild the Great Bridge after 3
the October gale. He replaced many of the books of the public library consumed 3
in the Colony House fire, and bought heavily in the lottery that gave the muddy 3
Market Parade and deep-rutted Town Street their pavement of great round 3
stones with a brick footwalk or "causey" in the middle. About this time, also, he 3
3
3
3
310 3
3
3
3
built the plain but excellent new house whose doorway is still such a triumph of 3
carving. When the Whitefield adherents broke off from Dr. Cotton's hill church 3
in 1743 and founded Deacon Snow's church across the Bridge, Curwen had gone 3
with them; though his zeal and attendance soon abated. Now, however, he 3
cultivated piety once more; as if to dispel the shadow which had thrown him into 3
isolation and would soon begin to wreck his business fortunes if not sharply 3
checked. 3
3
3
3
The sight of this strange, pallid man, hardly middle-aged in aspect yet certainly 3
not less than a full century old, seeking at last to emerge from a cloud of fright 3
and detestation too vague to pin down or analyse, was at once a pathetic, a 3
dramatic, and a contemptible thing. Such is the power of wealth and of surface 3
gestures, however, that there came indeed a slight abatement in the visible 3
aversion displayed toward him; especially after the rapid disappearances of his 3
sailors abruptly ceased. He must likewise have begun to practice an extreme care 3
and secrecy in his graveyard expeditions, for he was never again caught at such 3
wanderings; whilst the rumours of uncanny sounds and manoeuvres at his 3
Pawtuxet farm diminished in proportion. His rate of food consumption and 3
cattle replacement remained abnormally high; but not until modern times, when 3
Charles Ward examined a set of his accounts and invoices in the Shepley Library, 3
did it occur to any person - save one embittered youth, perhaps - to make dark 3
comparisons between the large number of Guinea blacks he imported until 1766, 3
and the disturbingly small number for whom he could produce bona fide bills of 3
sale either to slave-dealers at the Great Bridge or to the planters of the 3
Narragansett Country. Certainly, the cunning and ingenuity of this abhorred 3
character were uncannily profound, once the necessity for their exercise had 3
become impressed upon him. 3
3
But of course the effect of all this belated mending was necessarily slight. 3
Curwen continued to be avoided and distrusted, as indeed the one fact of his 3
continued air of youth at a great age would have been enough to warrant; and he 3
could see that in the end his fortunes would be likely to suffer. His elaborate 3
studies and experiments, whatever they may have been, apparently required a 3
heavy income for their maintenance; and since a change of environment would 3
deprive him of the trading advantages he had gained, it would not have profited 3
him to begin anew in a different region just then. Judgement demanded that he 3
patch up his relations with the townsfolk of Providence, so that his presence 3
might no longer be a signal for hushed conversation, transparent excuses or 3
errands elsewhere, and a general atmosphere of constraint and uneasiness. His 3
clerks, being now reduced to the shiftless and impecunious residue whom no 3
one else would employ, were giving him much worry; and he held to his sea- 3
3
3
3
311 3
3
3
3
captains and mates only by shrewdness in gaining some kind of ascendancy over 3
them - a mortgage, a promissory note, or a bit of information very pertinent to 3
their welfare. In many cases, diarists have recorded with some awe, Curwen 3
shewed almost the power of a wizard in unearthing family secrets for 3
questionable use. During the final five years of his life it seemed as though only 3
direct talks with the long-dead could possibly have furnished some of the data 3
which he had so glibly at his tongue's end. 3
3
About this time the crafty scholar hit upon a last desperate expedient to regain 3
his footing in the community. Hitherto a complete hermit, he now determined to 3
contract an advantageous marriage; securing as a bride some lady whose 3
unquestioned position would make all ostracism of his home impossible. It may 3
be that he also had deeper reasons for wishing an alliance; reasons so far outside 3
the known cosmic sphere that only papers found a century and a half after his 3
death caused anyone to suspect them; but of this nothing certain can ever be 3
learned. Naturally he was aware of the horror and indignation with which any 3
ordinary courtship of his would be received, hence he looked about for some 3
likely candidate upon whose parents he might exert a suitable pressure. Such 3
candidates, he found, were not at all easy to discover; since he had very 3
particular requirements in the way of beauty, accomplishments, and social 3
security. At length his survey narrowed down to the household of one of his best 3
and oldest ship-captains, a widower of high birth and unblemished standing 3
named Dutee Tillinghast, whose only daughter Eliza seemed dowered with 3
every conceivable advantage save prospects as an heiress. Capt. Tillinghast was 3
completely under the domination of Curwen; and consented, after a terrible 3
interview in his cupolaed house on Power's Lane hill, to sanction the 3
blasphemous alliance. 3
3
Eliza Tillinghast was at that time eighteen years of age, and had been reared as 3
gently as the reduced circumstances of her father permitted. She had attended 3
Stephen Jackson's school opposite the Court-House Parade; and had been 3
diligently instructed by her mother, before the latter's death of smallpox in 1757, 3
in all the arts and refinements of domestic life. A sampler of hers, worked in 1753 3
at the age of nine, may still be found in the rooms of the Rhode Island Historical 3
Society. After her mother's death she had kept the house, aided only by one old 3
black woman. Her arguments with her father concerning the proposed Curwen 3
marriage must have been painful indeed; but of these we have no record. Certain 3
it is that her engagement to young Ezra Weeden, second mate of the Crawford 3
packet Enterprise, was dutifully broken off, and that her union with Joseph 3
Curwen took place on the seventh of March, 1763, in the Baptist church, in the 3
presence of the most distinguished assemblages which the town could boast; the 3
ceremony being performed by the younger Samuel Winsor. The Gazette 3
mentioned the event very briefly, and in most surviving copies the item in 3
3
3
3
312 3
3
3
3
question seems to be cut or torn out. Ward found a single intact copy after much 3
search in the archives of a private collector of note, observing with amusement 3
the meaningless urbanity of the language: 3
3
'Monday evening last, Mr. Joseph Curwen, of this Town, Merchant, was married 3
to Miss Eliza Tillinghast, Daughter of Capt. Dutee Tillinghast, a young Lady who 3
has real Merit, added to a beautiful Person, to grace the connubial State and 3
perpetuate its Felicity.' 3
3
The collection of Durfee-Arnold letters, discovered by Charles Ward shortly 3
before his first reputed madness in the private collection of Melville F. Peters, 3
Esq., of George St., and covering this and a somewhat antecedent period, throws 3
vivid light on the outrage done to public sentiment by this ill-assorted match. 3
The social influence of the Tillinghasts, however, was not to be denied; and once 3
more Joseph Curwen found his house frequented by persons whom he could 3
never otherwise have induced to cross his threshold. His acceptance was by no 3
means complete, and his bride was socially the sufferer through her forced 3
venture; but at all events the wall of utter ostracism was somewhat torn down. In 3
his treatment of his wife the strange bridegroom astonished both her and the 3
community by displaying an extreme graciousness and consideration. The new 3
house in Olney Court was now wholly free from disturbing manifestations, and 3
although Curwen was much absent at the Pawtuxet farm which his wife never 3
visited, he seemed more like a normal citizen than at any other time in his long 3
years of residence. Only one person remained in open enmity with him, this 3
being the youthful ship's officer whose engagement to Eliza Tillinghast had been 3
so abruptly broken. Ezra Weeden had frankly vowed vengeance; and though of a 3
quiet and ordinarily mild disposition, was now gaining a hate-bred, dogged 3
purpose which boded no good to the usurping husband. 3
3
On the seventh of May, 1765, Curwen's only child Ann was born; and was 3
christened by the Rev. John Graves of King's Church, of which both husband and 3
wife had become communicants shortly after their marriage, in order to 3
compromise between their respective Congregational and Baptist affiliations. 3
The record of this birth, as well as that of the marriage two years before, was 3
stricken from most copies of the church and town annals where it ought to 3
appear; and Charles Ward located both with the greatest difficulty after his 3
discover of the widow's change of name had apprised him of his own 3
relationship, and engendered the feverish interest which culminated in his 3
madness. The birth entry, indeed, was found very curiously through 3
correspondence with the heirs of the loyalist Dr. Graves, who had taken with 3
him a duplicate set of records when he left his pastorate at the outbreak of the 3
Revolution. Ward had tried this source because he knew that his great-great- 3
grandmother Ann Tillinghast Potter had been an Episcopalian. 3
3
3
3
313 3
3
3
3
Shortly after the birth of his daughter, an event he seemed to welcome with a 3
fervour greatly out of keeping with his usual coldness, Curwen resolved to sit for 3
a portrait. This he had painted by a very gifted Scotsman named Cosmo 3
Alexander, then a resident of Newport, and since famous as the early teacher of 3
Gilbert Stuart. The likeness was said to have been executed on a wall-panel of the 3
library of the house in Olney Court, but neither of the two old diaries mentioning 3
it gave any hint of its ultimate disposition. At this period the erratic scholar 3
shewed signs of unusual abstraction, and spent as much time as he possibly 3
could at his farm on the Pawtuxet Road. He seemed, as was stated, in a condition 3
of suppressed excitement or suspense; as if expecting some phenomenal thing or 3
on the brink of some strange discovery. Chemistry or alchemy would appear to 3
have played a great part, for he took from his house to the farm the greater 3
number of his volumes on that subject. 3
3
His affectation of civic interest did not diminish, and he lost no opportunities for 3
helping such leaders as Stephen Hopkins, Joseph Brown, and Benjamin West in 3
their efforts to raise the cultural tone of the town, which was then much below 3
the level of Newport in its patronage of the liberal arts. He had helped Daniel 3
Jenckes found his bookshop in 1763, and was thereafter his best customer; 3
extending aid likewise to the struggling Gazette that appeared each Wednesday 3
at the Sign of Shakespeare's Head. In politics he ardently supported Governor 3
Hopkins against the Ward party whose prime strength was in Newport, and his 3
really eloquent speech at Hacher's Hall in 1765 against the setting off of North 3
Providence as a separate town with a pro-Ward vote in the General Assembly 3
did more than any other thing to wear down the prejudice against him. But Ezra 3
Weeden, who watched him closely, sneered cynically at all this outward activity; 3
and freely swore it was no more than a mask for some nameless traffick with the 3
blackest gulfs of Tartarus. The revengeful youth began a systematic study of the 3
man and his doings whenever he was in port; spending hours at night by the 3
wharves with a dory in readiness when he saw lights in the Curwen warehouses, 3
and following the small boat which would sometimes steal quietly off and down 3
the bay. He also kept as close a watch as possible on the Pawtuxet farm, and was 3
once severely bitten by the dogs the old Indian couple loosed upon him. 3
3
3
3
In 1766 came the final change in Joseph Curwen. It was very sudden, and gained 3
wide notice amongst the curious townsfolk; for the air of suspense and 3
expectancy dropped like an old cloak, giving instant place to an ill-concealed 3
exaltation of perfect triumph. Curwen seemed to have difficulty in restraining 3
himself from public harangues on what he had found or learned or made; but 3
apparently the need of secrecy was greater than the longing to share his 3
rejoicing, for no explanation was ever offered by him. It was after this transition. 3
3
3
3
314 3
3
3
3
which appears to have come early in July, that the sinister scholar began to 3
astonish people by his possession of information which only their long-dead 3
ancestors would seem to be able to impart. 3
3
But Curwen's feverish secret activities by no means ceased with this change. On 3
the contrary, they tended rather to increase; so that more and more of his 3
shipping business was handled by the captains whom he now bound to him by 3
ties of fear as potent as those of bankruptcy had been. He altogether abandoned 3
the slave trade, alleging that its profits were constantly decreasing. Every 3
possible moment was spent at the Pawtuxet farm; although there were rumours 3
now and then of his presence in places which, though not actually near 3
graveyards, were yet so situated in relation to graveyards that thoughtful people 3
wondered just how thorough the old merchant's change of habits really was. 3
Ezra Weeden, though his periods of espionage were necessarily brief and 3
intermittent on account of his sea voyaging, had a vindictive persistence which 3
the bulk of the practical townsfolk and farmers lacked; and subjected Curwen's 3
affairs to a scrutiny such as they had never had before. 3
3
Many of the odd manoeuvres of the strange merchant's vessels had been taken 3
for granted on account of the unrest of the times, when every colonist seemed 3
determined to resist the provisions of the Sugar Act which hampered a 3
prominent traffick. Smuggling and evasion were the rule in Narragansett Bay, 3
and nocturnal landings of illicit cargoes were continuous commonplaces. But 3
Weeden, night after night following the lighters or small sloops which he saw 3
steal off from the Curwen warehouses at the Town Street docks, soon felt 3
assured that it was not merely His Majesty's armed ships which the sinister 3
skulker was anxious to avoid. Prior to the change in 1766 these boats had for the 3
most part contained chained negroes, who were carried down and across the bay 3
and landed at an obscure point on the shore just north of Pawtuxet; being 3
afterward driven up the bluff and across country to the Curwen farm, where 3
they were locked in that enormous stone outbuilding which had only five high 3
narrow slits for windows. After that change, however, the whole programme 3
was altered. Importation of slaves ceased at once, and for a time Curwen 3
abandoned his midnight sailings. Then, about the spring of 1767, a new policy 3
appeared. Once more the lighters grew wont to put out from the black, silent 3
docks, and this time they would go down the bay some distance, perhaps as far 3
as Namquit Point, where they would meet and receive cargo from strange ships 3
of considerable size and widely varied appearance. Curwen's sailors would then 3
deposit this cargo at the usual point on the shore, and transport it overland to the 3
farm; locking it in the same cryptical stone building which had formerly received 3
the negroes. The cargo consisted almost wholly of boxes and cases, of which a 3
large proportion were oblong and heavy and disturbingly suggestive of coffins. 3
3
3
3
315 3
3
3
3
Weeden always watched the farm with unremitting assiduity; visiting it each 3
night for long periods, and seldom letting a week go by without a sight except 3
when the ground bore a footprint-revealing snow. Even then he would often 3
walk as close as possible in the travelled road or on the ice of the neighbouring 3
river to see what tracks others might have left. Finding his own vigils interrupted 3
by nautical duties, he hired a tavern companion named Eleazar Smith to 3
continue the survey during his absence; and between them the two could have 3
set in motion some extraordinary rumours. That they did not do so was only 3
because they knew the effect of publicity would be to warn their quarry and 3
make further progress impossible. Instead, they wished to learn something 3
definite before taking any action. What they did learn must have been startling 3
indeed, and Charles Ward spoke many times to his parents of his regret at 3
Weeden's later burning of his notebooks. All that can be told of their discoveries 3
is what Eleazar Smith jotted down in a non too coherent diary, and what other 3
diarists and letter-writers have timidly repeated from the statements which they 3
finally made - and according to which the farm was only the outer shell of some 3
vast and revolting menace, of a scope and depth too profound and intangible for 3
more than shadowy comprehension. 3
3
It is gathered that Weeden and Smith became early convinced that a great series 3
of tunnels and catacombs, inhabited by a very sizeable staff of persons besides 3
the old Indian and his wife, underlay the farm. The house was an old peaked 3
relic of the middle seventeenth century with enormous stack chimney and 3
diamond-paned lattice windows, the laboratory being in a lean-to toward the 3
north, where the roof came nearly to the ground. This building stood clear of any 3
other; yet judging by the different voices heard at odd times within, it must have 3
been accessible through secret passages beneath. These voices, before 1766, were 3
mere mumblings and negro whisperings and frenzied screams, coupled with 3
curious chants or invocations. After that date, however, they assumed a very 3
singular and terrible cast as they ran the gamut betwixt dronings of dull 3
acquiescence and explosions of frantic pain or fury, rumblings of conversations 3
and whines of entreaty, pantings of eagerness and shouts of protest. They 3
appeared to be in different languages, all known to Curwen, whose rasping 3
accents were frequently distinguishable in reply, reproof, or threatening. 3
Sometimes it seemed that several persons must be in the house; Curwen, certain 3
captives, and the guards of those captives. There were voices of a sort that 3
neither Weeden nor Smith had ever heard before despite their wide knowledge 3
of foreign parts, and many that they did seem to place as belonging to this or that 3
nationality. The nature of the conversations seemed always a kind of catechism, 3
as if Curwen were extorting some sort of information from terrified or rebellious 3
prisoners. 3
3
3
3
316 3
3
3
3
Weeden had many verbatim reports of overheard scraps in his notebook, for 3
Enghsh, French, and Spanish, which he knew, were frequently used; but of these 3
nothing has survived. He did, however, say that besides a few ghouhsh 3
dialogues in which the past affairs of Providence families were concerned, most 3
of the questions and answers he could understand were historical or scientific; 3
occasionally pertaining to very remote places and ages. Once, for example, an 3
alternately raging and sullen figure was questioned in French about the Black 3
Prince's massacre at Limoges in 1370, as if there were some hidden reason which 3
he ought to know. Curwen asked the prisoner - if prisoner he were - whether the 3
order to slay was given because of the Sign of the Goat found on the altar in the 3
ancient Roman crypt beneath the Cathedral, or whether the Dark Man of the 3
Haute Vienne had spoken the Three Words. Failing to obtain replies, the 3
inquisitor had seemingly resorted to extreme means; for there was a terrific 3
shriek followed by silence and muttering and a bumping sound. 3
3
None of these colloquies was ever ocularly witnessed, since the windows were 3
always heavily draped. Once, though, during a discourse in an unknown tongue, 3
a shadow was seen on the curtain which startled Weeden exceedingly; 3
reminding him of one of the puppets in a show he had seen in the autumn of 3
1764 in Hacher's Hall, when a man from Germantown, Pennsylvania, had given 3
a clever mechanical spectacle advertised as 3
3
'A View of the Famous City of Jerusalem, in which are represented Jerusalem, 3
the Temple of Solomon, his Royal Throne, the noted Towers, and Hills, likewise 3
the Suffering of Our Saviour from the Garden of Gethsemane to the Cross on the 3
Hill of Golgotha; an artful piece of Statuary, Worthy to be seen by the Curious.' 3
3
It was on this occasion that the listener, who had crept close to the window of the 3
front room whence the speaking proceeded, gave a start which roused the old 3
Indian pair and caused them to loose the dogs on him. After that no more 3
conversations were ever heard in the house, and Weeden and Smith concluded 3
that Curwen had transferred his field of action to regions below. 3
3
That such regions in truth existed, seemed amply clear from many things. Faint 3
cries and groans unmistakably came up now and then from what appeared to be 3
the solid earth in places far from any structure; whilst hidden in the bushes along 3
the river-bank in the rear, where the high ground sloped steeply down to the 3
valley of the Pawtuxet, there was found an arched oaken door in a frame of 3
heavy masonry, which was obviously an entrance to caverns within the hill. 3
When or how these catacombs could have been constructed, Weeden was unable 3
to say; but he frequently pointed out how easily the place might have been 3
reached by bands of unseen workmen from the river. Joseph Curwen put his 3
mongrel seamen to diverse uses indeed! During the heavy spring rains of 1769 3
3
3
3
317 3
3
3
3
the two watchers kept a sharp eye on the steep river-bank to see if any 3
subterrene secrets might be washed to hght, and were rewarded by the sight of a 3
profusion of both human and animal bones in places where deep gullies had 3
been worn in the banks. Naturally there might be many explanations of such 3
things in the rear of a stock farm, and a locality where old Indian bury-grounds 3
were common, but Weeden and Smith drew their own inferences. 3
3
It was in January 1770, whilst Weeden and Smith were still debating vainly on 3
what, if anything, to think or do about the whole bewildering business, that the 3
incident of the Fortaleza occurred. Exasperated by the burning of the revenue 3
sloop Liberty at Newport during the previous summer, the customs fleet under 3
Admiral Wallace had adopted an increased vigilance concerning strange vessels; 3
and on this occasion His Majesty's armed schooner Cygnet, under Capt. Charles 3
Leslie, captured after a short pursuit one early morning the scow Fortaleza of 3
Barcelona, Spain, under Capt. Manuel Arruda, bound according to its log from 3
Grand Cairo, Egypt, to Providence. When searched for contraband material, this 3
ship revealed the astonishing fact that its cargo consisted exclusively of Egyptian 3
mummies, consigned to "Sailor A. B. C", who would come to remove his goods 3
in a lighter just off Namquit Point and whose identity Capt. Arruda felt himself 3
in honour bound not to reveal. The Vice-Admiralty at Newport, at a loss what to 3
do in view of the non-contraband nature of the cargo on the one hand and of the 3
unlawful secrecy of the entry on the other hand, compromised on Collector 3
Robinson's recommendation by freeing the ship but forbidding it a port in Rhode 3
Island waters. There were later rumours of its having been seen in Boston 3
Harbour, though it never openly entered the Port of Boston. 3
3
This extraordinary incident did not fail of wide remark in Providence, and there 3
were not many who doubted the existence of some connexion between the cargo 3
of mummies and the sinister Joseph Curwen. His exotic studies and his curious 3
chemical importations being common knowledge, and his fondness for 3
graveyards being common suspicion; it did not take much imagination to link 3
him with a freakish importation which could not conceivably have been destined 3
for anyone else in the town. As if conscious of this natural belief, Curwen took 3
care to speak casually on several occasions of the chemical value of the balsams 3
found in mummies; thinking perhaps that he might make the affair seem less 3
unnatural, yet stopping just short of admitting his participation. Weeden and 3
Smith, of course, felt no doubt whatsoever of the significance of the thing; and 3
indulged in the wildest theories concerning Curwen and his monstrous labours. 3
3
The following spring, like that of the year before, had heavy rains; and the 3
watchers kept careful track of the river-bank behind the Curwen farm. Large 3
sections were washed away, and a certain number of bones discovered; but no 3
glimpse was afforded of any actual subterranean chambers or burrows. 3
3
3
3
318 3
3
3
3
Something was rumoured, however, at the village of Pawtuxet about a mile 3
below, where the river flows in falls over a rocky terrace to join the placed 3
landlocked cove. There, where quaint old cottages climbed the hill from the 3
rustic bridge, and fishing-smacks lay anchored at their sleepy docks, a vague 3
report went round of things that were floating down the river and flashing into 3
sight for a minute as they went over the falls. Of course the Pawtuxet in a long 3
river which winds through many settled regions abounding in graveyards, and 3
of course the spring rains had been very heavy; but the fisherfolk about the 3
bridge did not like the wild way that one of the things stared as it shot down to 3
the still waters below, or the way that another half cried out although its 3
condition had greatly departed from that of objects which normally cried out. 3
That rumour sent Smith - for Weeden was just then at sea - in haste to the river- 3
bank behind the farm; where surely enough there remained the evidence of an 3
extensive cave-in. There was, however, no trace of a passage into the steep bank; 3
for the miniature avalanche had left behind a solid wall of mixed earth and 3
shrubbery from aloft. Smith went to the extent of some experimental digging, but 3
was deterred by lack of success - or perhaps by fear of possible success. It is 3
interesting to speculate on what the persistent and revengeful Weeden would 3
have done had he been ashore at the time. 3
3
3
3
By the autumn of 1770 Weeden decided that the time was ripe to tell others of his 3
discoveries; for he had a large number of facts to link together, and a second eye- 3
witness to refute the possible charge that jealousy and vindictiveness had 3
spurred his fancy. As his first confidant he selected Capt. James Mathewson of 3
the Enterprise, who on the one hand knew him well enough not to doubt his 3
veracity, and on the other hand was sufficiently influential in the town to be 3
heard in turn with respect. The colloquy took place in an upper room of Sabin's 3
Tavern near the docks, with Smith present to corroborate virtually every 3
statement; and it could be seen that Capt. Mathewson was tremendously 3
impressed. Like nearly everyone else in the town, he had had black suspicions of 3
his own anent Joseph Curwen; hence it needed only this confirmation and 3
enlargement of data to convince him absolutely. At the end of the conference he 3
was very grave, and enjoined strict silence upon the two younger men. He 3
would, he said, transmit the information separately to some ten or so of the most 3
learned and prominent citizens of Providence; ascertaining their views and 3
following whatever advice they might have to offer. Secrecy would probably be 3
essential in any case, for this was no matter that the town constables or militia 3
could cope with; and above all else the excitable crowd must be kept in 3
ignorance, lest there be enacted in these already troublous times a repetition of 3
that frightful Salem panic of less than a century before which had first brought 3
Curwen hither. 3
3
3
3
319 3
3
3
3
The right persons to tell, he believed, would be Dr. Benjamin West, whose 3
pamphlet on the late transit of Venus proved him a scholar and keen thinker; 3
Rev. James Manning, President of the College which had just moved up from 3
Warren and was temporarily housed in the new King Street schoolhouse 3
awaiting the completion of its building on the hill above Presbyterian-Lane; ex- 3
Governor Stephen Hopkins, who had been a member of the Philosophical 3
Society at Newport, and was a man of very broad perceptions; John Carter, 3
publisher of the Gazette; all four of the Brown brothers, John, Joseph, Nicholas, 3
and Moses, who formed the recognised local magnates, and of whom Joseph was 3
an amateur scientist of parts; old Dr. Jabez Bowen, whose erudition was 3
considerable, and who had much first-hand knowledge of Curwen's odd 3
purchases; and Capt. Abraham Whipple, a privateersman of phenomenal 3
boldness and energy who could be counted on to lead in any active measures 3
needed. These men, if favourable, might eventually be brought together for 3
collective deliberation; and with them would rest the responsibility of deciding 3
whether or not to inform the Governor of the Colony, Joseph Wanton of 3
Newport, before taking action. 3
3
The mission of Capt. Mathewson prospered beyond his highest expectations; for 3
whilst he found one or two of the chosen confidants somewhat sceptical of the 3
possible ghastly side of Weeden's tale, there was not one who did not think it 3
necessary to take some sort of secret and coordinated action. Curwen, it was 3
clear, formed a vague potential menace to the welfare of the town and Colony; 3
and must be eliminated at any cost. Late in December 1770 a group of eminent 3
townsmen met at the home of Stephen Hopkins and debated tentative measures. 3
Weeden's notes, which he had given to Capt. Mathewson, were carefully read; 3
and he and Smith were summoned to give testimony anent details. Something 3
very like fear seized the whole assemblage before the meeting was over, though 3
there ran through that fear a grim determination which Capt. Whipple's bluff 3
and resonant profanity best expressed. They would not notify the Governor, 3
because a more than legal course seemed necessary. With hidden powers of 3
uncertain extent apparently at his disposal, Curwen was not a man who could 3
safely be warned to leave town. Nameless reprisals might ensue, and even if the 3
sinister creature complied, the removal would be no more than the shifting of an 3
unclean burden to another place. The times were lawless, and men who had 3
flouted the King's revenue forces for years were not the ones to balk at sterner 3
things when duty impelled. Curwen must be surprised at his Pawtuxet farm by a 3
large raiding-party of seasoned privateersmen and given one decisive chance to 3
explain himself. If he proved a madman, amusing himself with shrieks and 3
imaginary conversations in different voices, he would be properly confined. If 3
something graver appeared, and if the underground horrors indeed turned out 3
to be real, he and all with him must die. It could be done quietly, and even the 3
widow and her father need not be told how it came about. 3
3
3
3
320 3
3
3
3
While these serious steps were under discussion there occurred in the town an 3
incident so terrible and inexplicable that for a time little else was mentioned for 3
miles around. In the middle of a moon-light January night with heavy snow 3
underfoot there resounded over the river and up the hill a shocking series of 3
cries which brought sleepy heads to every window; and people around 3
Weybosset Point saw a great white thing plunging frantically along the badly 3
cleared space in front of the Turk's Head. There was a baying of dogs in the 3
distance, but this subsided as soon as the clamour of the awakened town became 3
audible. Parties of men with lanterns and muskets hurried out to see what was 3
happening, but nothing rewarded their search. The next morning, however, a 3
giant, muscular body, stark naked, was found on the jams of ice around the 3
southern piers of the Great Bridge, where the Long Dock stretched out beside 3
Abbott's distil-house, and the identity of this object became a theme for endless 3
speculation and whispering. It was not so much the younger as the older folk 3
who whispered, for only in the patriarchs did that rigid face with horror-bulging 3
eyes strike any chord of memory. They, shaking as they did so, exchanged 3
furtive murmurs of wonder and fear; for in those stiff, hideous features lay a 3
resemblance so marvellous as to be almost an identity - and that identity was 3
with a man who had died full fifty years before. 3
3
Ezra Weeden was present at the finding; and remembering the baying of the 3
night before, set out along Weybosset Street and across Muddy Dock Bridge 3
whence the sound had come. He had a curious expectancy, and was not 3
surprised when, reaching the edge of the settled district where the street merged 3
into the Pawtuxet Road, he came upon some very curious tracks in the snow. The 3
naked giant had been pursued by dogs and many booted men, and the returning 3
tracks of the hounds and their masters could be easily traced. They had given up 3
the chase upon coming too near the town. Weeden smiled grimly, and as a 3
perfunctory detail traced the footprints back to their source. It was the Pawtuxet 3
farm of Joseph Curwen, as he well knew it would be; and he would have given 3
much had the yard been less confusingly trampled. As it was, he dared not seem 3
too interested in full daylight. Dr. Bowen, to whom Weeden went at once with 3
his report, performed an autopsy on the strange corpse, and discovered 3
peculiarities which baffled him utterly. The digestive tracts of the huge man 3
seemed never to have been in use, whilst the whole skin had a coarse, loosely 3
knit texture impossible to account for. Impressed by what the old men whispered 3
of this body's likeness to the long-dead blacksmith Daniel Green, whose great- 3
grandson Aaron Hoppin was a supercargo in Curwen's employ, Weeden asked 3
casual questions till he found where Green was buried. That night a party of ten 3
visited the old North Burying Ground opposite Herrenden's Lane and opened a 3
grave. They found it vacant, precisely as they had expected. 3
3
3
3
321 3
3
3
3
Meanwhile arrangements had been made with the post riders to intercept Joseph 3
Curwen's mail, and shortly before the incident of the naked body there was 3
found a letter from one Jedediah Orne of Salem which made the cooperating 3
citizens think deeply. Parts of it, copied and preserved in the private archives of 3
the Smith family where Charles Ward found it, ran as follows. 3
3
I delight that you continue in ye Gett'g at Olde Matters in your Way, and doe not 3
think better was done at Mr. Hutchinson's in Salem- Village. Certainely, there 3
was Noth'g but ye liveliest Awfulness in that which H. rais'd upp from What he 3
cou'd gather onlie a part of. What you sente, did not Worke, whether because of 3
Any Thing miss'g, or because ye Wordes were not Righte from my Speak'g or yr 3
Copy'g. I alone am at a Loss. I have not ye Chymicall art to foUowe Borellus, and 3
owne my Self confounded by ye VII. Booke of ye Necronomicon that you 3
recommende. But I wou'd have you Observe what was told to us aboute tak'g 3
Care whom to calle upp, for you are Sensible what Mr. Mather writ in ye 3
3
Magnalia of , and can judge how truely that Horrendous thing is reported. I 3
3
say to you againe, doe not call up Any that you can not put downe; by the Which 3
I meane. Any that can in Turne call up Somewhat against you, whereby your 3
PowerfuUest Devices may not be of use. Ask of the Lesser, lest the Greater shal 3
not wish to Answer, and shal commande more than you. I was frighted when I 3
read of your know'g what Ben Zariatnatmik hadde in his ebony Boxe, for I was 3
conscious who must have tolde you. And againe I ask that you shalle write me as 3
Jedediah and not Simon. In this Community a Man may not live too long, and 3
you knowe my Plan by which I came back as my Son. I am desirous you will 3
Acquaint me with what ye Black Man learnt from Sylvanus Cocidius in ye Vault, 3
under ye Roman Wall, and will be oblig'd for ye lend'g of ye MS. you speak of. 3
3
Another and unsigned letter from Philadelphia provoked equal thought, 3
especially for the following passage: 3
3
I will observe what you say respecting the sending of Accounts only by yr 3
Vessels, but can not always be certain when to expect them. In the Matter spoke 3
of, I require onlie one more thing; but wish to be sure I apprehend you exactly. 3
You inform me, that no Part must be missing if the finest Effects are to be had, 3
but you can not but know how hard it is to be sure. It seems a great Hazard and 3
Burthen to take away the whole Box, and in Town (i.e. St. Peter's, St. Paul's, St. 3
Mary's or Christ Church) it can scarce be done at all. But I know what 3
Imperfections were in the one I rais'd up October last, and how many live 3
Specimens you were forc'd to imploy before you hit upon the right Mode in the 3
year 1766; so will be guided by you in all Matters. I am impatient for yr Brig, and 3
inquire daily at Mr. Biddle's Wharf. 3
3
3
3
322 3
3
3
3
A third suspicious letter was in an unknown tongue and even an unknown 3
alphabet. In the Smith diary found by Charles Ward a single oft-repeated 3
combination of characters is clumsily copied; and authorities at Brown 3
University have pronounced the alphabet Amharic or Abyssinian, although they 3
do not recognise the word. None of these epistles was ever delivered to Curwen, 3
though the disappearance of Jedediah Orne from Salem as recorded shortly 3
afterward shewed that the Providence men took certain quiet steps. The 3
Pennsylvania Historical Society also has some curious letters received by Dr. 3
Shippen regarding the presence of an unwholesome character in Philadelphia. 3
But more decisive steps were in the air, and it is in the secret assemblages of 3
sworn and tested sailors and faithful old privateersmen in the Brown 3
warehouses by night that we must look for the main fruits of Weeden's 3
disclosures. Slowly and surely a plan of campaign was under development 3
which would leave no trace of Joseph Curwen's noxious mysteries. 3
3
Curwen, despite all precautions, apparently felt that something was in the wind; 3
for he was now remarked to wear an unusually worried look. His coach was seen 3
at all hours in the town and on the Pawtuxet Road, and he dropped little by little 3
the air of forced geniality with which he had latterly sought to combat the town's 3
prejudice. The nearest neighbours to his farm, the Fenners, one night remarked a 3
great shaft of light shooting into the sky from some aperture in the roof of that 3
cryptical stone building with the high, excessively narrow windows; an event 3
which they quickly communicated to John Brown in Providence. Mr. Brown had 3
become the executive leader of the select group bent on Curwen's extirpation, 3
and had informed the Fenners that some action was about to be taken. This he 3
deemed needful because of the impossibility of their not witnessing the final 3
raid; and he explained his course by saying that Curwen was known to be a spy 3
of the customs officers at Newport, against whom the hand of every Providence 3
skipper, merchant, and farmer was openly or clandestinely raised. Whether the 3
ruse was wholly believed by neighbours who had seen so many queer things is 3
not certain; but at any rate the Fenners were willing to connect any evil with a 3
man of such queer ways. To them Mr. Brown had entrusted the duty of watching 3
the Curwen farmhouse, and of regularly reporting every incident which took 3
place there. 3
3
3
3
The probability that Curwen was on guard and attempting unusual things, as 3
suggested by the odd shaft of light, precipitated at last the action so carefully 3
devised by the band of serious citizens. According to the Smith diary a company 3
of about 100 men met at 10 p.m. on Friday, April 12th, 1771, in the great room of 3
Thurston's Tavern at the Sign of the Golden Lion on Weybosset Point across the 3
Bridge. Of the guiding group of prominent men in addition to the leader John 3
3
3
3
323 3
3
3
3
Brown there were present Dr. Bowen, with his case of surgical instruments. 3
President Manning without the great periwig (the largest in the Colonies) for 3
which he was noted. Governor Hopkins, wrapped in his dark cloak and 3
accompanied by his seafaring brother Esek, whom he had initiated at the last 3
moment with the permission of the rest, John Carter, Capt. Mathewson, and 3
Capt. Whipple, who was to lead the actual raiding party. These chiefs conferred 3
apart in a rear chamber, after which Capt. Whipple emerged to the great room 3
and gave the gathered seamen their last oaths and instructions. Eleazar Smith 3
was with the leaders as they sat in the rear apartment awaiting the arrival of Ezra 3
Weeden, whose duty was to keep track of Curwen and report the departure of 3
his coach for the farm. 3
3
About 10:30 a heavy rumble was heard on the Great Bridge, followed by the 3
sound of a coach in the street outside; and at that hour there was no need of 3
waiting for Weeden in order to know that the doomed man had set out for his 3
last night of unhallowed wizardry. A moment later, as the receding coach 3
clattered faintly over the Muddy Dock Bridge, Weeden appeared; and the raiders 3
fell silently into military order in the street, shouldering the firelocks, fowling- 3
pieces, or whaling harpoons which they had with them. Weeden and Smith were 3
with the party, and of the deliberating citizens there were present for active 3
service Capt. Whipple, the leader, Capt. Esek Hopkins, John Carter, President 3
Manning, Capt. Mathewson, and Dr. Bowen; together with Moses Brown, who 3
had come up at the eleventh hour though absent from the preliminary session in 3
the tavern. All these freemen and their hundred sailors began the long march 3
without delay, grim and a trifle apprehensive as they left the Muddy Dock 3
behind and mounted the gentle rise of Broad Street toward the Pawtuxet Road. 3
Just beyond Elder Snow's church some of the men turned back to take a parting 3
look at Providence lying outspread under the early spring stars. Steeples and 3
gables rose dark and shapely, and salt breezes swept up gently from the cove 3
north of the Bridge. Vega was climbing above the great hill across the water, 3
whose crest of trees was broken by the roof-line of the unfinished College edifice. 3
At the foot of that hill, and along the narrow mounting lanes of its side, the old 3
town dreamed; Old Providence, for whose safety and sanity so monstrous and 3
colossal a blasphemy was about to be wiped out. 3
3
An hour and a quarter later the raiders arrived, as previously agreed, at the 3
Fenner farmhouse; where they heard a final report on their intended victim. He 3
had reached his farm over half an hour before, and the strange light had soon 3
afterward shot once more into the sky, but there were no lights in any visible 3
windows. This was always the case of late. Even as this news was given another 3
great glare arose toward the south, and the party realised that they had indeed 3
come close to the scene of awesome and unnatural wonders. Capt. Whipple now 3
ordered his force to separate into three divisions; one of twenty men under 3
3
3
3
324 3
3
3
3
Eleazar Smith to strike across to the shore and guard the landing-place against 3
possible reinforcements for Curwen until summoned by a messenger for 3
desperate service, a second of twenty men under Capt. Esek Hopkins to steal 3
down into the river valley behind the Curwen farm and demolish with axes or 3
gunpowder the oaken door in the high, steep bank, and the third to close in on 3
the house and adjacent buildings themselves. Of this division one third was to be 3
led by Capt. Mathewson to the cryptical stone edifice with high narrow 3
windows, another third to follow Capt. Whipple himself to the main farmhouse, 3
and the remaining third to preserve a circle around the whole group of buildings 3
until summoned by a final emergency signal. 3
3
The river party would break down the hillside door at the sound of a single 3
whistle-blast, then wait and capture anything which might issue from the regions 3
within. At the sound of two whistle-blasts it would advance through the 3
aperture to oppose the enemy or join the rest of the raiding contingent. The party 3
at the stone building would accept these respective signals in an analogous 3
manner; forcing an entrance at the first, and at the second descending whatever 3
passage into the ground might be discovered, and joining the general or focal 3
warfare expected to take place within the caverns. A third or emergency signal of 3
three blasts would summon the immediate reserve from its general guard duty; 3
its twenty men dividing equally and entering the unknown depths through both 3
farmhouse and stone building. Capt. Whipple's belief in the existence of 3
catacombs was absolute, and he took no alternative into consideration when 3
making his plans. He had with him a whistle of great power and shrillness, and 3
did not fear any upsetting or misunderstanding of signals. The final reserve at 3
the landing, of course, was nearly out of the whistle's range; hence would require 3
a special messenger if needed for help. Moses Brown and John Carter went with 3
Capt. Hopkins to the river-bank, while President Manning was detailed with 3
Capt. Mathewson to the stone building. Dr. Bowen, with Ezra Weeden, remained 3
in Capt. Whipple's party which was to storm the farmhouse itself. The attack was 3
to begin as soon as a messenger from Capt. Hopkins had joined Capt. Whipple to 3
notify him of the river party's readiness. The leader would then deliver the loud 3
single blast, and the various advance parties would commence their 3
simultaneous attack on three points. Shortly before 1 a.m. the three divisions left 3
the Fenner farmhouse; one to guard the landing, another to seek the river valley 3
and the hillside door, and the third to subdivide and attend to teh actual 3
buildings of the Curwen farm. 3
3
Eleazar Smith, who accompanied the shore-guarding party, records in his diary 3
an uneventful march and a long wait on the bluff by the bay; broken once by 3
what seemed to be the distant sound of the signal whistle and again by a peculiar 3
muffled blend of roaring and crying and a powder blast which seemed to come 3
from the same direction. Later on one man thought he caught some distant 3
3
3
3
325 3
3
3
3
gunshots, and still later Smith himself felt the throb of titanic and thunderous 3
words resounding in upper air. It was just before dawn that a single haggard 3
messenger with wild eyes and a hideous unknown odour about his clothing 3
appeared and told the detachment to disperse quietly to their homes and never 3
again think or speak of the night's doings or of him who had been Joseph 3
Curwen. Something about the bearing of the messenger carried a conviction 3
which his mere words could never have conveyed; for though he was a seaman 3
well known to many of them, there was something obscurely lost or gained in his 3
soul which set him for evermore apart. It was the same later on when they met 3
other old companions who had gone into that zone of horror. Most of them had 3
lost or gained something imponderable and indescribable. They had seen or 3
heard or felt something which was not for human creatures, and could not forget 3
it. From them there was never any gossip, for to even the commonest of mortal 3
instincts there are terrible boundaries. And from that single messenger the party 3
at the shore caught a nameless awe which almost sealed their own lips. Very few 3
are the rumours which ever came from any of them, and Eleazar Smith's diary is 3
the only written record which has survived from that whole expedition which set 3
forth from the Sign of the Golden Lion under the stars. 3
3
Charles Ward, however, discovered another vague sidelight in some Fenner 3
correspondence which he found in New London, where he knew another branch 3
of the family had lived. It seems that the Fenners, from whose house the doomed 3
farm was distantly visible, had watched the departing columns of raiders; and 3
had heard very clearly the angry barking of the Curwen dogs, followed by the 3
first shrill blast which precipitated the attack. This blast had been followed by a 3
repetition of the great shaft of light from the stone building, and in another 3
moment, after a quick sounding of the second signal ordering a general invasion, 3
there had come a subdued prattle of musketry followed by a horrible roaring cry 3
which the correspondent Luke Fenner had represented in his epistle by the 3
characters 'Waaaahrrrrr-R'waaahrrr.' 3
3
This cry, however, had possessed a quality which no mere writing could convey, 3
and the correspondent mentions that his mother fainted completely at the sound. 3
It was later repeated less loudly, and further but more muffled evidences of 3
gunfire ensued; together with a loud explosion of powder from the direction of 3
the river. About an hour afterward all the dogs began to bark frightfully, and 3
there were vague ground rumblings so marked that the candlesticks tottered on 3
the mantelpiece. A strong smell of sulphur was noted; and Luke Tenner's father 3
declared that he heard the third or emergency whistle signal, though the others 3
failed to detect it. Muffled musketry sounded again, followed by a deep scream 3
less piercing but even more horrible than the those which had preceded it; a kind 3
of throaty, nastily plastic cough or gurgle whose quality as a scream must have 3
3
3
3
326 3
3
3
3
come more from its continuity and psychological import than from its actual 3
acoustic value. 3
3
Then the flaming thing burst into sight at a point where the Curwen farm ought 3
to lie, and the human cries of desperate and frightened men were heard. Muskets 3
flashed and cracked, and the flaming thing fell to the ground. A second flaming 3
thing appeared, and a shriek of human origin was plainly distinguished. Fenner 3
wrote that he could even gather a few words belched in frenzy: Almighty, 3
protect thy lamb! Then there were more shots, and the second flaming thing fell. 3
After that came silence for about three-quarters of an hour; at the end of which 3
time little Arthur Fenner, Luke's brother, exclaimed that he saw "a red fog" 3
going up to the stars from the accursed farm in the distance. No one but the child 3
can testify to this, but Luke admits the significant coincidence implied by the 3
panic of almost convulsive fright which at the same moment arched the backs 3
and stiffened the fur of the three cats then within the room. 3
3
Five minutes later a chill wind blew up, and the air became suffused with an 3
intolerable stench that only the strong freshness of the sea could have prevented 3
its being notice by the shore party or by any wakeful souls in the Pawtuxet 3
village. This stench was nothing which any of the Tenners had ever encountered 3
before, and produced a kind of clutching, amorphous fear beyond that of the 3
tomb or the charnel-house. Close upon it came the awful voice which no hapless 3
hearer will ever be able to forget. It thundered out of the sky like a doom, and 3
windows rattled as its echoes died away. It was deep and musical; powerful as a 3
bass organ, but evil as the forbidden books of the Arabs. What it said no man can 3
tell, for it spoke in an unknown tongue, but this is the writing Luke Fenner set 3
down to portray the daemoniac intonations: 'DEESMEES JESHET BONE 3
DOSEFE DUVEMA ENITEMOSS.' Not till the year 1919 did any soul link this 3
crude transcript with anything else in mortal knowledge, but Charles Ward 3
paled as he recognised what Mirandola had denounced in shudders as the 3
ultimate horror among black magic's incantations. 3
3
An unmistakable human shout or deep chorused scream seemed to answer this 3
malign wonder from the Curwen farm, after which the unknown stench grew 3
complex with an added odour equally intolerable. A wailing distinctly different 3
from the scream now burst out, and was protracted ululantly in rising and falling 3
paroxysms. At times it became almost articulate, though no auditor could trace 3
any definite words; and at one point it seemed to verge toward the confines of 3
diabolic and hysterical laughter. Then a yell of utter, ultimate fright and stark 3
madness wrenched from scores of human throats - a yell which came strong and 3
clear despite the depth from which it must have burst; after which darkness and 3
silence ruled all things. Spirals of acrid smoke ascended to blot out the stars. 3
3
3
3
327 3
3
3
3
though no flames appeared and no buildings were observed to be gone or 3
injured on the following day. 3
3
Toward dawn two frightened messengers with monstrous and unplaceable 3
odours saturating their clothing knocked at the Fenner door and requested a keg 3
of rum, for which they paid very well indeed. One of them told the family that 3
the affair of Joseph Curwen was over, and that the events of the night were not to 3
be mentioned again. Arrogant as the order seemed, the aspect of him who gave it 3
took away all resentment and lent it a fearsome authority; so that only these 3
furtive letters of Luke Fenner, which he urged his Connecticut relative to 3
destroy, remain to tell what was seen and heard. The non-compliance of that 3
relative, whereby the letters were saved after all, has alone kept the matter from 3
a merciful oblivion. Charles Ward had one detail to add as a result of a long 3
canvass of Pawtuxet residents for ancestral traditions. Old Charles Slocum of that 3
village said that there was known to his grandfather a queer rumour concerning 3
a charred, distorted body found in the fields a week after the death of Joseph 3
Curwen was announced. What kept the talk alive was the notion that this body, 3
so far as could be seen in its burnt and twisted condition, was neither thoroughly 3
human nor wholly allied to any animal which Pawtuxet folk had ever seen or 3
read about. 3
3
3
3
Not one man who participated in that terrible raid could ever be induced to say a 3
word concerning it, and every fragment of the vague data which survives comes 3
from those outside the final fighting party. There is something frightful in the 3
care with which these actual raiders destroyed each scrap which bore the least 3
allusion to the matter. Eight sailors had been killed, but although their bodies 3
were not produced their families were satisfied with the statement that a clash 3
with customs officers had occurred. The same statement also covered the 3
numerous cases of wounds, all of which were extensively bandaged and treated 3
only by Dr. Jabez Bowen, who had accompanied the party. Hardest to explain 3
was the nameless odour clinging to all the raiders, a thing which was discussed 3
for weeks. Of the citizen leaders, Capt. Whipple and Moses Brown were most 3
severely hurt, and letters of their wives testify the bewilderment which their 3
reticence and close guarding of their bandages produced. Psychologically every 3
participant was aged, sobered, and shaken. It is fortunate that they were all 3
strong men of action and simple, orthodox religionists, for with more subtle 3
introspectiveness and mental complexity they would have fared ill indeed. 3
President Manning was the most disturbed; but even he outgrew the darkest 3
shadow, and smothered memories in prayers. Every man of those leaders had a 3
stirring part to play in later years, and it is perhaps fortunate that this is so. Little 3
more than a twelvemonth afterward Capt. Whipple led the mob who burnt the 3
3
3
3
328 3
3
3
3
revenue ship Gaspee, and in this bold act we may trace one step in the blotting 3
out of unwholesome images. 3
3
There was delivered to the widow of Joseph Curwen a sealed leaden coffin of 3
curious design, obviously found ready on the spot when needed, in which she 3
was told her husband's body lay. He had, it was explained, been killed in a 3
customs battle about which it was not politic to give details. More than this no 3
tongue ever uttered of Joseph Curwen's end, and Charles Ward had only a single 3
hint wherewith to construct a theory. This hint was the merest thread - a shaky 3
underscoring of a passage in Jedediah Orne's confiscated letter to Curwen, as 3
partly copied in Ezra Weeden's handwriting. The copy was found in the 3
possession of Smith's descendants; and we are left to decide whether Weeden 3
gave it to his companion after the end, as a mute clue to the abnormality which 3
had occurred, or whether, as is more probable. Smith had it before, and added 3
the underscoring himself from what he had managed to extract from his friend 3
by shrewd guessing and adroit cross-questioning. The underlined passage is 3
merely this: 3
3
I say to you againe, doe not call up Any that you can not put downe; by the 3
Which I meane. Any that can in Turne call up Somewhat against you, whereby 3
your Powerfullest Devices may not be of use. Ask of the Lesser, lest the Greater 3
shal not wish to Answer, and shal commande more than you. 3
3
In the light of this passage, and reflecting on what last unmentionable allies a 3
beaten man might try to summon in his direst extremity, Charles Ward may well 3
have wondered whether any citizen of Providence killed Joseph Curwen. 3
3
The deliberate effacement of every memory of the dead man from Providence life 3
and annals was vastly aided by the influence of the raiding leaders. They had not 3
at first meant to be so thorough, and had allowed the widow and her father and 3
child to remain in ignorance of the true conditions; but Capt. Tillinghast was an 3
astute man, and soon uncovered enough rumours to whet his horror and cause 3
him to demand that the daughter and granddaughter change their name, burn 3
the library and all remaining papers, and chisel the inscription from the slate slab 3
above Joseph Curwen's grave. He knew Capt. Whipple well, and probably 3
extracted more hints from that bluff mariner and anyone else ever gained 3
repecting the end of the accursed sorcerer. 3
3
From that time on the obliteration of Curwen's memory became increasingly 3
rigid, extending at last by common consent even to the town records and files of 3
the Gazette. It can be compared in spirit only to the hush that lay on Oscar 3
Wilde's name for a decade after his disgrace, and in extent only to the fate of that 3
3
3
3
329 3
3
3
3
sinful King of Runazar in Lord Dunsany's tale, whom the Gods decided must not 3
only cease to be, but must cease ever to have been. 3
3
Mrs. Tillinghast, as the widow became known after 1772, sold the house in Olney 3
Court and resided with her father in Power's Lane till her death in 1817. The 3
farm at Pawtuxet, shunned by every living soul, remained to moulder through 3
the years; and seemed to decay with unaccountable rapidity. By 1780 only the 3
stone and brickwork were standing, and by 1800 even these had fallen to 3
shapeless heaps. None ventured to pierce the tangled shrubbery on the river- 3
bank behind which the hillside door may have lain, nor did any try to frame a 3
definite image of the scenes amidst which Joseph Curwen departed from the 3
horrors he had wrought. 3
3
Only robust old Capt. Whipple was heard by alert listeners to mutter once in a 3
3
while to himself, "Pox on that , but he had no business to laugh while he 3
3
screamed. 'Twas as though the damn'd had some'at up his sleeve. For half a 3
3
crown I'd burn his home.' 3
3
III. A Search and an Evocation 3
3
3
3
Charles Ward, as we have seen, first learned in 1918 of his descent from Joseph 3
Curwen. That he at once took an intense interest in everything pertaining to the 3
bygone mystery is not to be wondered at; for every vague rumour that he had 3
heard of Curwen now became something vital to himself, in whom flowed 3
Curwen's blood. No spirited and imaginative genealogist could have done 3
otherwise than begin forthwith an avid and systematic collection of Curwen 3
data. 3
3
In his first delvings there was not the slightest attempt at secrecy; so that even 3
Dr. Lyman hesitates to date the youth's madness from any period before the 3
close of 1919. He talked freely with his family - though his mother was not 3
particularly pleased to own an ancestor like Curwen - and with the officials of 3
the various museums and libraries he visited. In applying to private families for 3
records thought to be in their possession he made no concealment of his object, 3
and shared the somewhat amused scepticism with which the accounts of the old 3
diarists and letter-writers were regarded. He often expressed a keen wonder as 3
to what really had taken place a century and a half before at the Pawtuxet 3
farmhouse whose site he vainly tried to find, and what Joseph Curwen really had 3
been. 3
3
3
3
330 3
3
3
3
When he came across the Smith diary and archives and encountered the letter 3
from Jedediah Orne he decided to visit Salem and look up Curwen's early 3
activities and connexions there, which he did during the Easter vacation of 1919. 3
At the Essex Institute, which was well known to him from former sojourns in the 3
glamorous old town of crumbling Puritan gables and clustered gambrel roofs, he 3
was very kindly received, and unearthed there a considerable amount of Curwen 3
data. He found that his ancestor was born in Salem-Village, now Danvers, seven 3
miles from town, on the eighteenth of February (O.S.) 1662-3; and that he had run 3
away to sea at the age of fifteen, not appearing again for nine years, when he 3
returned with the speech, dress, and manners of a native Englishman and settled 3
in Salem proper. At that time he had little to do with his family, but spent most 3
of his hours with the curious books he had brought from Europe, and the strange 3
chemicals which came for him on ships from England, France, and Holland. 3
Certain trips of his into the country were the objects of much local 3
inquisitiveness, and were whisperingly associated with vague rumours of fires 3
on the hills at night. 3
3
Curwen's only close friends had been one Edward Hutchinson of Salem-Village 3
and one Simon Orne of Salem. With these men he was often seen in conference 3
about the Common, and visits among them were by no means infrequent. 3
Hutchinson had a house well out toward the woods, and it was not altogether 3
liked by sensitive people because of the sounds heard there at night. He was said 3
to entertain strange visitors, and the lights seen from his windows were not 3
always of the same colour. The knowledge he displayed concerning long-dead 3
persons and long-forgotten events was considered distinctly unwholesome, and 3
he disappeared about the time the witchcraft panic began, never to be heard 3
from again. At that time Joseph Curwen also departed, but his settlement in 3
Providence was soon learned of. Simon Orne lived in Salem until 1720, when his 3
failure to grow visibly old began to excite attention. He thereafter disappeared, 3
though thirty years later his precise counterpart and self-styled son turned up to 3
claim his property. The claim was allowed on the strength of documents in 3
Simon Orne's known hand, and Jedediah Orne continued to dwell in Salem till 3
1771, when certain letters from Providence citizens to the Rev. Thomas Barnard 3
and others brought about his quiet removal to parts unknown. 3
3
Certain documents by and about all of the strange characters were available at 3
teh Essex Institute, the Court House, and the Registry of Deeds, and included 3
both harmless commonplaces such as land titles and bills of sale, and furtive 3
fragments of a more provocative nature. There were four or five unmistakable 3
allusions to them on the witchcraft trial records; as when one Hepzibah Lawson 3
swore on July 10, 1692, at the Court of Oyer and Terminer under Judge 3
Hathorne, that: 'fortie Witches and the Blacke Man were wont to meete in the 3
Woodes behind Mr. Hutchinson's house', and one Amity How declared at a 3
3
3
3

3
3
3
session of August 8th before Judge Gedney that:'Mr. G. B. (Rev. George 3
Burroughs) on that Nighte putt ye Divell his Marke upon Bridget S., Jonathan A., 3
Simon O., Dehverance W., Joseph C, Susan P., Mehitable C, and Deborah B.' 3
3
Then there was a catalogue of Hutchinson's uncanny Hbrary as found after his 3
disappearance, and an unfinished manuscript in his handwriting, couched in a 3
cipher none could read. Ward had a photostatic copy of this manuscript made, 3
and began to work casually on the cipher as soon as it was delivered to him. 3
After the following August his labours on the cipher became intense and 3
feverish, and there is reason to believe from his speech and conduct that he hit 3
upon the key before October or November. He never stated, though, whether or 3
not he had succeeded. 3
3
But of greatest immediate interest was the Orne material. It took Ward only a 3
short time to prove from identity of penmanship a thing he had already 3
considered established from the text of the letter to Curwen; namely, that Simon 3
Orne and his supposed son were one and the same person. As Orne had said to 3
his correspondent, it was hardly safe to live too long in Salem, hence he resorted 3
to a thirty -year sojourn abroad, and did not return to claim his lands except as a 3
representative of a new generation. Orne had apparently been careful to destroy 3
most of his correspondence, but the citizens who took action in 1771 found and 3
preserved a few letters and papers which excited their wonder. There were 3
cryptic formulae and diagrams in his and other hands which Ward now either 3
copied with care or had photographed, and one extremely mysterious letter in a 3
chirography that the searcher recognised from items in the Registry of Deeds as 3
positively Joseph Curwen's. 3
3
This Curwen letter, though undated as to the year, was evidently not the one in 3
answer to which Orne had written the confiscated missive; and from internal 3
evidence Ward placed it not much later than 1750. It may not be amiss to give the 3
text in full, as a sample of the style of one whose history was so dark and terrible. 3
The recipient is addressed as "Simon", but a line (whether drawn by Curwen or 3
Orne Ward could not tell) is run through the word. 3

3
This letter, oddly enough, was what first gave Ward the exact location of 3
Curwen's Providence home; for none of the records encountered up to that time 3
had been at all specific. The discovery was doubly striking because it indicated as 3
the newer Curwen house, built in 1761 on the site of the old, a dilapidated 3
building still standing in Olney Court and well known to Ward in his 3
antiquarian rambles over Stampers' Hill. The place was indeed only a few 3
squares from his own home on the great hill's higher ground, and was now the 3
abode of a negro family much esteemed for occasional washing, housecleaning, 3
and furnace-tending services. To find, in distant Salem, such sudden proof of the 3
significance of this familiar rookery in his own family history, was a highly 3
impressive thing to Ward; and he resolved to explore the place immediately 3
upon his return. The more mystical phases of the letter, which he took to be some 3
extravagant kind of symbolism, frankly baffled him; though he noted with a 3
thrill of curiousity that the Biblical passage referred to - Job 14,14 - was the 3
familiar verse, 'If a man die, shall he live again? All the days of my appointed 3
time will I wait, until my change come.' 3
3
3
3
Young Ward came home in a state of pleasant excitement, and spent the 3
following Saturday in a long and exhaustive study of the house in Olney Court. 3
The place, now crumbling with age, had never been a mansion; but was a modest 3
two-and-a-half story wooden town house of the familiar Providence colonial 3
type, with plain peaked roof, large central chimney, and artistically carved 3
doorway with rayed fanlight, triangular pediment, and trim Doric pilasters. It 3
had suffered but little alteration externally, and Ward felt he was gazing on 3
something very close to the sinister matters of his quest. 3
3
The present negro inhabitants were known to him, and he was very courteously 3
shewn about the interior by old Asa and his stout wife Hannah. Here there was 3
more change than the outside indicated, and Ward saw with regret that fully half 3
of the fine scroll-and-urn overmantels and shell-carved cupboard linings were 3
gone, whilst most of the fine wainscotting and bolection moulding was marked. 3
3
3
3
334 3
3
3
3
hacked, and gouged, or covered up altogether with cheap wall-paper. In general, 3
the survey did not yield as much as Ward had somehow expected; but it was at 3
least exciting to stand within the ancestral walls which had housed such a man of 3
horror as Joseph Curwen. He saw with a thrill that a monogram had been very 3
carefully effaced from the ancient brass knocker. 3
3
From then until after the close of school Ward spent his time on the photostatic 3
copy of the Hutchinson cipher and the accumulation of local Curwen data. The 3
former still proved unyielding; but of the latter he obtained so much, and so 3
many clues to similar data elsewhere, that he was ready by July to make a trip to 3
New London and New York to consult old letters whose presence in those places 3
was indicated. This trip was very fruitful, for it brought him the Tenner letters 3
with their terrible description of the Pawtuxet farmhouse raid, and the 3
Nightingale-Talbot letters in which he learned of the portrait painted on a panel 3
of the Curwen library. This matter of the portrait interested him particularly, 3
since he would have given much to know just what Joseph Curwen looked like; 3
and he decided to make a second search of the house in Olney Court to see if 3
there might not be some trace of the ancient features beneath peeling coats of 3
later paint or layers of mouldy wall-paper. 3
3
Early in August that search took place, and Ward went carefully over the walls 3
of every room sizeable enough to have been by any possibility the library of the 3
evil builder. He paid especial attention to the large panels of such overmantels as 3
still remained; and was keenly excited after about an hour, when on a broad area 3
above the fireplace in a spacious ground-floor room he became certain that the 3
surface brought out by the peeling of several coats of paint was sensibly darker 3
than any ordinary interior paint or the wood beneath it was likely to have been. 3
A few more careful tests with a thin knife, and he knew that he had come upon 3
an oil portrait of great extent. With truly scholarly restraint the youth did not risk 3
the damage which an immediate attempt to uncover the hidden picture with the 3
knife might have been, but just retired from the scene of his discovery to enlist 3
expert help. In three days he returned with an artist of long experience, Mr. 3
Walter C. Dwight, whose studio is near the foot of College Hill; and that 3
accomplished restorer of paintings set to work at once with proper methods and 3
chemical substances. Old Asa and his wife were duly excited over their strange 3
visitors, and were properly reimbursed for this invasion of their domestic hearth. 3
3
As day by the day the work of restoration progressed, Charles Ward looked on 3
with growing interest at the lines and shades gradually unveiled after their long 3
oblivion. Dwight had begun at the bottom; hence since the picture was a three- 3
quarter-length one, the face did not come out for some time. It was meanwhile 3
seen that the subject was a spare, well-shaped man with dark-blue coat, 3
embroidered waistcoat, black satin small-clothes, and white silk stockings, seated 3
3
3
3
335 3
3
3
3
in a carved chair against the background of a window with wharves and ships 3
beyond. When the head came out it was observed to bear a neat Albemarle wig, 3
and to possess a thin, calm, undistinguished face which seemed somehow 3
familiar to both Ward and the artist. Only at the very last, though, did the 3
restorer and his client begin to grasp with astonishment at the details of that lean, 3
pallid visage, and to recognise with a touch of awe the dramatic trick which 3
heredity had played. For it took the final bath of oil and the final stroke of the 3
delicate scraper to bring out fully the expression which centuries had hidden; 3
and to confront the bewildered Charles Dexter Ward, dweller in the past, with 3
his own living features in the countenance of his horrible great-great-great- 3
grandfather. 3
3
Ward brought his parents to see the marvel he had uncovered, and his father at 3
once determined to purchase the picture despite its execution on stationary 3
panelling. The resemblance to the boy, despite an appearance of rather great age, 3
was marvellous; and it could be seen that through some trick of atavism the 3
physical contours of Joseph Curwen had found precise duplication after a 3
century and a half. Mrs. Ward's resemblance to her ancestor was not at all 3
marked, though she could recall relatives who had some of the facial 3
characteristics shared by her son and by the bygone Curwen. She did not relish 3
the discovery, and told her husband that he had better burn the picture instead 3
of bringing it home. There was, she averred, something unwholesome about it; 3
not only intrinsically, but in its very resemblance to Charles. Mr. Ward, however, 3
was a practical man of power and affairs - a cotton manufacturer with extensive 3
mills at Riverpoint in the Pawtuxet Valley - and not one to listen to feminine 3
scruples. The picture impressed him mightily with its likeness to his son, and he 3
believed the boy deserved it as a present. In this opinion, it is needless to say, 3
Charles most heartily concurred; and a few days later Mr. Ward located the 3
owner of the house - a small rodent-featured person with a guttural accent - and 3
obtained the whole mantel and overmantel bearing the picture at a curtly fixed 3
price which cut short the impending torrent of unctuous haggling. 3
3
It now remained to take off the panelling and remove it to the Ward home, 3
where provisions were made for its thorough restoration and installation with an 3
electric mock-fireplace in Charles's third-floor study or library. To Charles was 3
left the task of superintending this removal, and on the twenty -eighth of August 3
he accompanied two expert workmen from the Crooker decorating firm to the 3
house in Olney Court, where the mantel and portrait-bearing overmantel were 3
detached with great care and precision for transportation in the company's 3
motor truck. There was left a space of exposed brickwork marking the chimney's 3
course, and in this young Ward observed a cubical recess about a foot square, 3
which must have lain directly behind the head of the portrait. Curious as to what 3
such a space might mean or contain, the youth approached and looked within; 3
3
3
3
336 3
3
3
3
finding beneath the deep coatings of dust and soot some loose yellowed papers, 3
a crude, thick copybook, and a few mouldering textile shreds which may have 3
formed the ribbon binding the rest together. Blowing away the bulk of the dirt 3
and cinders, he took up the book and looked at the bold inscription on its cover. 3
It was in a hand which he had learned to recognise at the Essex Institute, and 3
proclaimed the volume as the 'Journall and Notes of Jos: Curwen, Gent, of 3
Prouidence-Plantations, Late of Salem.' 3
3
Excited beyond measure by his discovery. Ward shewed the book to the two 3
curious workmen beside him. Their testimony is absolute as to the nature and 3
genuineness of the finding, and Dr. Willett relies on them to help establish his 3
theory that the youth was not mad when he began his major eccentricities. All 3
the other papers were likewise in Curwen's handwriting, and one of them 3
seemed especially portentous because of its inscription: 'To Him Who Shal Come 3
After, & How He May Gett Beyonde Time & Ye Spheres.' 3
3
Another was in a cipher; the same. Ward hoped, as the Hutchinson cipher which 3
had hitherto baffled him. A third, and here the searcher rejoiced, seemed to be a 3
key to the cipher; whilst the fourth and fifth were addressed respectively 3
to:'Edw: Hutchinson, Armiger' and Jedediah Orne, esq.', 'or Their Heir or Heirs, 3
or Those Represent'g Them.' The sixth and last was inscribed: 'Joseph Curwen 3
his Life and Travells Bet'n ye yeares 1678 and 1687: Of Whither He Voyag'd, 3
Where He Stay'd, Whom He Sawe, and What He Learnt.' 3
3
3
3
We have now reached the point from which the more academic school of 3
alienists date Charles Ward's madness. Upon his discovery the youth had looked 3
immediately at a few of the inner pages of the book and manuscripts, and had 3
evidently seen something which impressed him tremendously. Indeed, in 3
shewing the titles to the workmen, he appeared to guard the text itself with 3
peculiar care, and to labour under a perturbation for which even the antiquarian 3
and genealogical significance of the find could hardly account. Upon returning 3
home he broke the news with an almost embarrassed air, as if he wished to 3
convey an idea of its supreme importance without having to exhibit the evidence 3
itself. He did not even shew the titles to his parents, but simply told them that he 3
had found some documents in Joseph Curwen's handwriting, 'mostly in cipher', 3
which would have to be studied very carefully before yielding up their true 3
meaning. It is unlikely that he would have shewn what he did to the workmen, 3
had it not been for their unconcealed curiousity. As it was he doubtless wished to 3
avoid any display of peculiar reticence which would increase their discussion of 3
the matter. 3
3
3
3
337 3
3
3
3
That night Charles Ward sat up in his room reading the new-found book and 3
papers, and when day came he did not desist. His meals, on his urgent request 3
when his mother called to see what was amiss, were sent up to him; and in the 3
afternoon he appeared only briefly when the men came to install the Curwen 3
picture and mantelpiece in his study. The next night he slept in snatches in his 3
clothes, meanwhile wrestling feverishly with the unravelling of the cipher 3
manuscript. In the morning his mother saw that he was at work on the 3
photostatic copy of the Hutchinson cipher, which he had frequently shewn her 3
before; but in response to her query he said that the Curwen key could not be 3
applied to it. That afternoon he abandoned his work and watched the men 3
fascinatedly as they finished their installation of the picture with its woodwork 3
above a cleverly realistic electric log, setting the mock-fireplace and overmantel a 3
little out from the north wall as if a chimney existed, and boxing in the sides with 3
panelling to match the room's. The front panel holding the picture was sawn and 3
hinged to allow cupboard space behind it. After the workmen went he moved his 3
work into the study and sat down before it with his eyes half on the cipher and 3
half on the portrait which stared back at him like a year-adding and century- 3
recalling mirror. 3
3
His parents, subsequently recalling his conduct at this period, give interesting 3
details anent the policy of concealment which he practised. Before servants he 3
seldom hid any paper which he might by studying, since he rightly assumed that 3
Curwen's intricate and archaic chirography would be too much for them. With 3
his parents, however, he was more circumspect; and unless the manuscript in 3
question were a cipher, or a mere mass of cryptic symbols and unknown 3
ideographs (as that entitled 'To Him Who Shal Come After, etc' seemed to be), 3
he would cover it with some convenient paper until his caller had departed. At 3
night he kept the papers under lock and key in an antique cabinet of his, where 3
he also placed them whenever he left the room. He soon resumed fairly regular 3
hours and habits, except that his long walks and other outside interests seemed 3
to cease. The opening of school, where he now began his senior year, seemed a 3
great bore to him; and he frequently asserted his determination never to bother 3
with college. He had, he said, important special investigations to make, which 3
would provide him with more avenues toward knowledge and the humanities 3
than any university which the world could boast. 3
3
Naturally, only one who had always been more or less studious, eccentric, and 3
solitary could have pursued this course for many days without attracting notice. 3
Ward, however, was constitutionally a scholar and a hermit; hence his parents 3
were less surprised than regretful at the close confinement and secrecy he 3
adopted. At the same time, both his father and mother thought it odd that he 3
would shew them no scrap of his treasure-trove, nor give any connected account 3
of such data as he had deciphered. This reticence he explained away as due to a 3
3
3
3
338 3
3
3
3
wish to wait until he might announce some connected revelation, but as the 3
weeks passed without further disclosures there began to grow up between the 3
youth and his family a kind of constraint; intensified in his mother's case by her 3
manifest disapproval of all Curwen delvings. 3
3
During October Ward began visiting the libraries again, but no longer for the 3
antiquarian matter of his former days. Witchcraft and magic, occultism and 3
daemonology, were what he sought now; and when Providence sources proved 3
unfruitful he would take the train for Boston and tap the wealth of the great 3
library in Copley Square, the Widener Library at Harvard, or the Zion Research 3
Library in Brookline, where certain rare works on Biblical subjects are available. 3
He bought extensively, and fitted up a whole additional set of shelves in his 3
study for newly acquired works on uncanny subjects; while during the 3
Christmas holidays he made a round of out-of-town trips including one to Salem 3
to consult certain records at the Essex Institute. 3
3
About the middle of January, 1920, there entered Ward's bearing an element of 3
triumph which he did not explain, and he was no more found at work upon the 3
Hutchinson cipher. Instead, he inaugurated a dual policy of chemical research 3
and record-scanning; fitting up for the one a laboratory in the unused attic of the 3
house, and for the latter haunting all the sources of vital statistics in Providence. 3
Local dealers in drugs and scientific supplies, later questioned, gave 3
astonishingly queer and meaningless catalogues of the substances and 3
instruments he purchased; but clerks at the State House, the City Hall, and the 3
various libraries agree as to the definite object of his second interest. He was 3
searching intensely and feverishly for the grave of Joseph Curwen, from whose 3
slate slab an older generation had so wisely blotted the name. 3
3
Little by little there grew upon the Ward family the conviction that something 3
was wrong. Charles had had freaks and changes of minor interests before, but 3
this growing secrecy and absorption in strange pursuits was unlike even him. 3
His school work was the merest pretence; and although he failed in no test, it 3
could be seen that the older application had all vanished. He had other 3
concernments now; and when not in his new laboratory with a score of obsolete 3
alchemical books, could be found either poring over old burial records down 3
town or glued to his volumes of occult lore in his study, where the startlingly - 3
one almost fancied increasingly - similar features of Joseph Curwen stared 3
blandly at him from the great overmantel on the North wall. 3
3
Late in March Ward added to his archive-searching a ghoulish series of rambles 3
about the various ancient cemeteries of the city. The cause appeared later, when 3
it was learned from City Hall clerks that he had probably found an important 3
clue. His quest had suddenly shifted from the grave of Joseph Curwen to that of 3
3
3
3
339 3
3
3
3
one Naphthali Field; and this shift was explained when, upon going over the files 3
that he had been over, the investigators actually found a fragmentary record of 3
Curwen's burial which had escaped the general obliteration, and which stated 3
that the curious leaden coffin had been interred '10 ft. S. and 5 ft. W. of Naphthali 3
Field's grave in y-.' The lack of a specified burying-ground in the surviving entry 3
greatly complicated the search, and Naphthali Field's grave seemed as elusive as 3
that of Curwen; but here no systematic effacement had existed, and one might 3
reasonably be expected to stumble on the stone itself even if its record had 3
perished. Hence the rambles - from which St. John's (the former King's) 3
Churchyard and the ancient Congregational burying-ground in the midst of 3
Swan Point Cemetery were excluded, since other statistics had shewn that the 3
only Naphthali Field (obiit 1729) whose grave could have been meant had been a 3
Baptist. 3
3
3
3
It was toward May when Dr. Willett, at the request of the senior Ward, and 3
fortified with all the Curwen data which the family had gleaned from Charles in 3
his non-secretive days, talked with the young man. The interview was of little 3
value or conclusiveness, for Willett felt at every moment that Charles was 3
thorough master of himself and in touch with matters of real importance; but it 3
at least force the secretive youth to offer some rational explanation of his recent 3
demeanour. Of a pallid, impassive type not easily shewing embarrassment. 3
Ward seemed quite ready to discuss his pursuits, though not to reveal their 3
object. He stated that the papers of his ancestor had contained some remarkable 3
secrets of early scientific knowledge, for the most part in cipher, of an apparent 3
scope comparable only to the discoveries of Friar Bacon and perhaps surpassing 3
even those. They were, however, meaningless except when correlated with a 3
body of learning now wholly obsolete; so that their immediate presentation to a 3
world equipped only with modern science would rob them of all impressiveness 3
and dramatic significance. To take their vivid place in the history of human 3
thought they must first be correlated by one familiar with the background out of 3
which they evolved, and to this task of correlation Ward was now devoting 3
himself. He was seeking to acquire as fast as possible those neglected arts of old 3
which a true interpreter of the Curwen data must possess, and hoped in time to 3
made a full announcement and presentation of the utmost interest to mankind 3
and to the world of thought. Not even Einstein, he declared, could more 3
profoundly revolutionise the current conception of things. 3
3
As to his graveyard search, whose object he freely admitted, but the details of 3
whose progress he did not relate, he said he had reason to think that Joseph 3
Curwen's mutilated headstone bore certain mystic symbols - carved from 3
directions in his will and ignorantly spared by those who had effaced the name - 3
3
3
3
340 3
3
3
3
which were absolutely essential to the final solution of his cryptic system. 3
Curwen, he believed, had wish to guard his secret with care; and had 3
consequently distributed the data in an exceedingly curious fashion. When Dr. 3
Willett asked to see the mystic documents. Ward displayed much reluctance and 3
tried to put him off with such things as photostatic copies of the Hutchinson 3
cipher and Orne formulae and diagrams; but finally shewed him the exteriors of 3
some of the real Curwen finds - the 'Journall and Notes', the cipher (title in 3
cipher also), and the formula-filled message 'To Him Who Shal Come After' - 3
and let him glance inside such as were in obscure characters. 3
3
He also opened the diary at a page carefully selected for its innocuousness and 3
gave Willett a glimpse of Curwen's connected handwriting in English. The 3
doctor noted very closely the crabbed and complicated letters, and the general 3
aura of the seventeenth century which clung round both penmanship and style 3
despite the writer's survival into the eighteenth century, and became quickly 3
certain that the document was genuine. The text itself was relatively trivial, and 3
Willett recalled only a fragment: 3
3
'Wedn. 16 Octr. 1754. My Sloope the Wakeful this Day putt in from London with 3
XX newe Men pick'd up in ye Indies, Spaniards from Martineco and 2 Dutch 3

strange he can not give me the Use of What he hath so well us'd these hundred 3
Yeares. Simon hath not writ these V. Weekes, but I expecte soon hear'g from 3
Him.' 3
3
When upon reaching this point Dr. Willett turned the leaf he was quickly 3
checked by Ward, who almost snatched the book from his grasp. All that the 3
doctor had a chance to see on the newly opened page was a brief pair of 3
sentences; but these, strangely enough, lingered tenacious in his memory. They 3
ran: 'Ye Verse from Liber-Damnatus be'g spoke V Roodmasses and IV Hallows- 3
Eves, I am Hopeful ye Thing is breed'g Outside ye Spheres. It will drawe One 3
who is to Come, if I can make sure he shal Bee, and he shal think on Past Thinges 3
and look back thro' all ye Yeares, against ye Which I must have ready ye Saltes or 3
That to make 'em with.' 3
3
3
3
341 3
3
3
3
Willett saw no more, but somehow this small glimpse gave a new and vague 3
terror to the painted features of Joseph Curwen which stared blandly down from 3
the overmantel. Even after that he entertained the odd fancy - which his medical 3
skill of course assured him was only a fancy - that the eyes of the portrait had a 3
sort of wish, if not an actual tendency, to follow young Charles Ward as he move 3
about the room. He stopped before leaving to study the picture closely, 3
marvelling at its resemblance to Charles and memorising every minute detail of 3
the cryptical, colourless face, even down to a slight scar or pit in the smooth 3
brow above the right eye. Cosmo Alexander, he decided, was a painter worthy of 3
the Scotland that produced Raeburn, and a teacher worthy of his illustrious pupil 3
Gilbert Stuart. 3
3
Assured by the doctor that Charles's mental health was in no danger, but that on 3
the other hand he was engaged in researches which might prove of real 3
importance, the Wards were more lenient than they might otherwise have been 3
when during the following June the youth made positive his refusal to attend 3
college. He had, he declared, studies of much more vital importance to pursue; 3
and intimated a wish to go abroad the following year in order to avail himself of 3
certain sources of data not existing in America. The senior Ward, while denying 3
this latter wish as absurd for a boy of only eighteen, acquiesced regarding the 3
university; so that after a none too brilliant graduation from the Moses Brown 3
School there ensued for Charles a three-year period of intensive occult study and 3
graveyard searching. He became recognised as an eccentric, and dropped even 3
more completely from the sight of his family's friends than he had been before; 3
keeping close to his work and only occasionally making trips to other cities to 3
consult obscure records. Once he went south to talk to a strange mulatto who 3
dwelt in a swamp and about whom a newspaper hand printed a curious article. 3
Again he sought a small village in the Adirondacks whence reports of certain 3
odd ceremonial practices had come. But still his parents forbade him the trip to 3
the Old World which he desired. 3
3
Coming of age in April, 1923, and having previously inherited a small 3
competence from his maternal grandfather. Ward determined at last to take the 3
European trip hitherto denied him. Of his proposed itinerary he would say 3
nothing save that the needs of his studies would carry him to many places, but 3
he promised to write his parents fully and faithfully. When they saw he could 3
not be dissuaded, they ceased all opposition and helped as best they could; so 3
that in June the young man sailed for Liverpool with the farewell blessings of his 3
father and mother, who accompanied him to Boston and waved him out of sight 3
from the White Star pier in Charlestown. Letters soon told of his safe arrival, and 3
of his securing good quarters in Great Russell Street, London; where he proposed 3
to stay, shunning all family friends, till he had exhausted the resources of the 3
British Museum in a certain direction. Of his daily life he wrote by little, for there 3
3
3
3
342 3
3
3
3
was little to write. Study and experiment consumed all his time, and he 3
mentioned a laboratory which he had established in one of his rooms. That he 3
said nothing of antiquarian rambles in the glamorous old city with its luring 3
skyline of ancient domes and steeples and its tangles of roads and alleys whose 3
mystic convolutions and sudden vistas alternately beckon and surprise, was 3
taken by his parents as a good index of the degree to which his new interests had 3
engrossed his mind. 3
3
In June, 1924, a brief note told of his departure for Paris, to which he had before 3
made one or two flying trips for material in the Bibliotheque Nationale. For three 3
months thereafter he sent only postal cards, giving an address in the Rue St. 3
Jacques and referring to a special search among rare manuscripts in the library of 3
an unnamed private collector. He avoided acquaintances, and no tourists 3
brought back reports of having seen him. Then came a silence, and in October the 3
Wards received a picture card from Prague, Czecho-Slovakia, stating that 3
Charles was in that ancient town for the purpose of conferring with a certain 3
very aged man supposed to be the last living possessor of some very curious 3
mediaeval information. He gave an address in the Neustadt, and announced no 3
move till the following January; when he dropped several cards from Vienna 3
telling of his passage through that city on the way toward a more easterly region 3
whither one of his correspondents and fellow-delvers into the occult had invited 3
him. 3
3
The next card was from Klausenburg in Transylvania, and told of Ward's 3
progress toward his destination. He was going to visit a Baron Ferenczy, whose 3
estate lay in the mountains east of Rakus; and was to be addressed at Rakus in 3
the care of that nobleman. Another card from Rakus a week later, saying that his 3
host's carriage had met him and that he was leaving the village for the 3
mountains, was his last message for a considerable time; indeed, he did reply to 3
his parents' frequent letters until May, when he wrote to discourage the plan of 3
his mother for a meeting in London, Paris, or Rome during the summer, when 3
the elder Wards were planning to travel to Europe. His researches, he said, were 3
such that he could not leave his present quarters; while the situation of Baron 3
Ferenczy's castle did not favour visits. It was on a crag in the dark wooded 3
mountains, and the region was so shunned by the country folk that normal 3
people could not help feeling ill at ease. Moreover, the Baron was not a person 3
likely to appeal to correct and conservative New England gentlefolk. His aspect 3
and manners had idiosyncrasies, and his age was so great as to be disquieting. It 3
would be better, Charles said, if his parents would wait for his return to 3
Providence; which could scarcely be far distant. 3
3
That return did not, however, take place until May 1926, when after a few 3
heralding cards the young wanderer quietly slipped into New York on the 3
3
3
3
343 3
3
3
3
Homeric and traversed the long miles to Providence by motor-coach, eagerly 3
drinking in the green rolling hills, and fragrant, blossoming orchards, and the 3
white steepled towns of vernal Connecticut; his first taste of ancient New 3
England in nearly four years. When the coach crossed the Pawcatuck and 3
entered Rhode Island amidst the faery goldenness of a late spring afternoon his 3
heart beat with quickened force, and the entry to Providence along Reservoir and 3
Elmwood Avenues was a breathless and wonderful thing despite the depths of 3
forbidden lore to which he had delved. At the high square where Broad, 3
Weybosset, and Empire Streets join, he saw before and below him in the fire of 3
sunset the pleasant, remembered houses and domes and steeples of the old town; 3
and his head swam curiously as the vehicle rolled down to the terminal behind 3
the Biltmore, bringing into view the great dome and soft, roof-pierced greenery 3
of the ancient hill across the river, and the tall colonial spire of the First Baptist 3
Church limned pink in the magic evening against the fresh springtime verdure of 3
its precipitous background. 3
3
Old Providence! It was this place and the mysterious forces of its long, 3
continuous history which had brought him into being, and which had drawn 3
him back toward marvels and secrets whose boundaries no prophet might fix. 3
Here lay the arcana, wondrous or dreadful as the case may be, for which all his 3
years of travel and application had been preparing him. A taxicab whirled him 3
through Post Office Square with its glimpse of the river, the old Market House, 3
and the head of the bay, and up the steep curved slope of Waterman Street to 3
Prospect, where the vast gleaming dome and sunset-flushed Ionic columns of the 3
Christian Science Church beckoned northward. Then eight squares past the fine 3
old estates his childish eyes had known, and the quaint brick sidewalks so often 3
trodden by his youthful feet. And at last the little white overtaken farmhouse on 3
the right, on the left the classic Adam porch and stately facade of the great brick 3
house where he was born. It was twilight, and Charles Dexter Ward had come 3
home. 3
3
3
3
A school of alienists slightly less academic than Dr. Lyman's assign to Ward's 3
European trip the beginning of his true madness. Admitting that he was sane 3
when he started, they believe that his conduct upon returning implies a 3
disastrous change. But even to this claim Dr. Willett refuses to concede. There 3
was, he insists, something later; and the queerness of the youth at this stage he 3
attributes to the practice of rituals learned abroad - odd enough things, to be 3
sure, but by no means implying mental aberration on the part of their celebrant. 3
Ward himself, though visibly aged and hardened, was still normal in his general 3
reactions; and in several talks with Dr. Willett displayed a balance which no 3
madman - even an incipient one - could feign continuously for long. What 3
3
3
3
344 3
3
3
3
elicited the notion of insanity at this period were the sounds heard at all hours 3
from Ward's attic laboratory, in which he kept himself most of the time. There 3
were chantings and repetitions, and thunderous declamations in uncanny 3
rhythms; and although these sounds were always in Ward's own voice, there 3
was something in the quality of that voice, and in the accents of the formulae it 3
pronounced, which could not by chill the blood of every hearer. It was noticed 3
that Nig, the venerable and beloved black cat of the household, bristled and 3
arched his back perceptibly when certain of the tones were heard. 3
3
The odours occasionally wafted from the laboratory were likewise exceedingly 3
strange. Sometimes they were very noxious, but more often they were aromatic, 3
with a haunting, elusive quality which seemed to have the power of inducing 3
fantastic images. People who smelled them had a tendency to glimpse 3
momentary mirages of enormous vistas, with strange hills or endless avenues of 3
sphinxes and hippogriffs stretching off into infinite distance. Ward did not 3
resume his old-time rambles, but applied himself diligently to the strange books 3
he had brought home, and to equally strange delvings within his quarters; 3
explaining that European sources had greatly enlarged the possibilities of his 3
work, and promising great revelations in the years to come. His older aspect 3
increased to a startling degree his resemblance to the Curwen portrait in his 3
library; and Dr. Willett would often pause by the latter after a call, marvelling at 3
the virtual identity, and reflecting that only the small pit above the picture's right 3
eye now remained to differentiate the long-dead wizard from the living youth. 3
These calls of Willett' s, undertaken at the request of teh senior Wards, were 3
curious affairs. Ward at no time repulsed the doctor, but the latter saw that he 3
could never reach the young man's inner psychology. Frequently he noted 3
peculiar things about; little wax images of grotesque design on the shelves or 3
tables, and the half-erased remnants of circles, triangles, and pentagrams in chalk 3
or charcoal on the cleared central space of the large room. And always in the 3
night those rhythms and incantations thundered, till it became very difficult to 3
keep servants or suppress furtive talk of Charles's madness. 3
3
In January, 1927, a peculiar incident occurred. One night about midnight, as 3
Charles was chanting a ritual whose weird cadence echoed unpleasantly through 3
the house below, there came a sudden gust of chill wind from the bay, and a 3
faint, obscure trembling of the earth which everyone in the neighbourhood 3
noted. At the same time the cat exhibited phenomenal traces of fright, while dogs 3
bayed for as much as a mile around. This was the prelude to a sharp 3
thunderstorm, anomalous for the season, which brought with it such a crash that 3
Mr. and Mrs. Ward believed the house had been struck. They rushed upstairs to 3
see what damage had been done, but Charles met them at the door to the attic; 3
pale, resolute, and portentous, with an almost fearsome combination of triumph 3
and seriousness on his face. He assured them that the house had not really been 3
3
3
3
345 3
3
3
3
struck, and that the storm would soon be over. They paused, and looking 3
through a window saw that he was indeed right; for the lightning flashed farther 3
and farther off, whilst the trees ceased to bend in the strange frigid gust from the 3
water. The thunder sank to a sort of dull mumbling chuckle and finally died 3
away. Stars came out, and the stamp of triumph on Charles Ward's face 3
crystallised into a very singular expression. 3
3
For two months or more after this incident Ward was less confined than usual to 3
his laboratory. He exhibited a curious interest in the weather, and made odd 3
inquires about the date of the spring thawing of the ground. One night late in 3
March he left the house after midnight, and did not return till almost morning; 3
when his mother, being wakeful, heard a rumbling motor draw up to the 3
carriage entrance. Muffled oaths could be distinguished, and Mrs. Ward, rising 3
and going to the window, saw four dark figures removing a long, heavy box 3
from a truck at Charles's direction and carrying it within by the side door. She 3
heard laboured breathing and ponderous footfalls on the stairs, and finally a dull 3
thumping in the attic; after which the footfalls descended again, and the four 3
reappeared outside and drove off in their truck. 3
3
The next day Charles resumed his strict attic seclusion, drawing down the dark 3
shades of his laboratory windows and appearing to be working on some metal 3
substance. He would open the door to no one, and steadfastly refused all 3
proffered food. About noon a wrenching sound followed by a terrible cry and a 3
fall were heard, but when Mrs. Ward rapped at the door her son at length 3
answered faintly, and told her that nothing had gone amiss. The hideous and 3
indescribable stench now welling out was absolutely harmless and unfortunately 3
necessary. Solitude was the one prime essential, and he would appear later for 3
dinner. That afternoon, after the conclusion of some odd hissing sounds which 3
came from behind the locked portal, he did finally appear; wearing an extremely 3
haggard aspect and forbidding anyone to enter the laboratory upon any pretext. 3
This, indeed, proved the beginning of a new policy of secrecy; for never 3
afterward was any other person permitted to visit either the mysterious garret 3
workroom or the adjacent storeroom which he cleaned out, furnished roughly, 3
and added to his inviolable private domain as a sleeping apartment. Here he 3
lived, with books brought up from his library beneath, till the time he purchased 3
the Pawtuxet bungalow and moved to it all his scientific effects. 3
3
In the evening Charles secured the paper before the rest of the family and 3
damaged part of it through an apparent accident. Later on Dr. Willett, having 3
fixed the date from statements by various members of the household, looked up 3
an intact copy at the Journal office and found that in the destroyed section the 3
following small item had occurred: 3

3
Nocturnal Diggers Surprised in North Burial Ground 3
3
Robert Hart, night watchman at the North Burial Ground, this morning 3
discovered a party of several men with a motor truck in the oldest part of the 3
cemetery, but apparently frightened them off before they had accomplished 3
whatever their object may have been. 3
3
The discovery took place at about four o'clock, when Hart's attention was 3
attracted by the sound of a motor outside his shelter. Investigating, he saw a 3
large truck on the main drive several rods away; but could not reach it before the 3
noise of his feet on the gravel had revealed his approach. The men hastily placed 3
a large box in the truck and drove away toward the street before they could be 3
overtaken; and since no known grave was disturbed. Hart believes that this box 3
was an object which they wished to bury. 3
3
The diggers must have been at work for a long while before detection, for Hart 3
found an enormous hold dug at a considerable distance back from the roadway 3
in the lot of Amasa Field, where most of the old stones have long ago 3
disappeared. The hole, a place as large and deep as a grave, was empty; and did 3
not coincide with any interment mentioned in the cemetery records. 3
3
Sergt. Riley of the Second Station viewed the spot and gave the opinion that the 3
hole was dug by bootleggers rather gruesomely and ingeniously seeking a safe 3
cache for liquor in a place not likely to be disturbed. In reply to questions Hart 3
said he though the escaping truck had headed up Rochambeau Avenue, though 3
he could not be sure. 3
3
During the next few days Charles Ward was seldom seen by his family. Having 3
added sleeping quarters to his attic realm, he kept closely to himself there, 3
ordering food brought to the door and not taking it in until after the servant had 3
gone away. The droning of monotonous formulae and the chanting of bizarre 3
rhythms recurred at intervals, while at other times occasional listeners could 3
detect the sound of tinkling glass, hissing chemicals, running water, or roaring 3
gas flames. Odours of the most unplaceable quality, wholly unlike any before 3
noted, hung at times around the door; and the air of tension observable in the 3
young recluse whenever he did venture briefly forth was such as to excite the 3
keenest speculation. Once he made a hasty trip to the Athenaeum for a book he 3
required, and again he hired a messenger to fetch him a highly obscure volume 3
from Boston. Suspense was written portentously over the whole situation, and 3
both the family and Dr. Willett confessed themselves wholly at a loss what to do 3
or think about it. 3
3
3
3
347 3
3
3
3
Then on the fifteenth of April a strange development occurred. While nothing 3
appeared to grow different in kind, there was certainly a very terrible difference 3
in degree; and Dr. Willett somehow attaches great significance to the change. The 3
day was Good Friday, a circumstance of which the servants made much, but 3
which others quite naturally dismiss as an irrelevant coincidence. Late in the 3
afternoon young Ward began repeating a certain formula in a singularly loud 3
voice, at the same time burning some substance so pungent that its fumes 3
escaped over the entire house. The formula was so plainly audible in the hall 3
outside the locked door that Mrs. Ward could not help memorising it as she 3
waited and listened anxiously, and later on she was able to write it down at Dr. 3
Willett's request. It ran as follows, and experts have told Dr. Willett that its very 3
close analogue can be found in the mystic writings of "Eliphas Levi", that cryptic 3
soul who crept through a crack in the forbidden door and glimpsed the frightful 3
vistas of the void beyond: 3
3
'Per Adonai Eloim, Adonai Jehova, 3
3
Adonai Sabaoth, Metraton On Agla Mathon, 3
3
verbum pythonicum, mysterium salamandrae, 3
3
conventus sylvorum, antra gnomorum, 3
3
daemonia Coeli God, Almonsin, Gibor, Jehosua, 3
Evam, Zariatnatmik, veni, veni, veni.' 3
3
This had been going on for two hours without change or intermission when over 3
all the neighbourhood a pandaemoniac howling of dogs set in. The extent of this 3
howling can be judged from the space it received in the papers the next day, but 3
to those in the Ward household it was overshadowed by the odour which 3
instantly followed it; a hideous, all-pervasive odour which non of them had ever 3
smelt before or have ever smelt since. In the midst of this mephitic flood there 3
came a very perceptible flash like that of lightning, which would have been 3
blinding and impressive but for the daylight around; and then was heard the 3
voice that no listener can ever forget because of its thunderous remoteness, its 3
incredible depth, and its eldritch dissimilarity to Charles Ward's voice. It shook 3
the house, and was clearly heard by at least two neighbours above the howling 3
of the dogs. Mrs. Ward, who had been listening in despair outside her son's 3
locked laboratory, shivered as she recognised its hellish imports; for Charles had 3
told of its evil fame in dark books, and of the manner in which it had thundered, 3
according to the Tenner letter, above the doomed Pawtuxet farmhouse on the 3
night of Joseph Curwen's annihilation. There was no mistaking that nightmare 3
phrase, for Charles had described it too vividly in the old days when he had 3
talked frankly of his Curwen investigations. And yet it was only this fragment of 3
an archaic and forgotten language: 'DIES MIES JESCHET BOENE DOESEF 3
DOUVEMA ENITEMAUS.' 3
3
3
3
348 3
3
3
3
Close upon this thundering there came a momentary darkening of the dayhght, 3
though sunset was still an hour distant, and then a puff of added odour different 3
from the first but equally unknown and intolerable. Charles was chanting again 3
now and his mother could hear syllables that sounded like 'Yi nash Yog Sothoth 3
he Igeb throdag' - ending in a 'Yah!' whose maniacal force mounted in an ear- 3
splitting crescendo. A second later all previous memories were effaced by the 3
wailing scream which burst out with frantic explosiveness and gradually 3
changed form to a paroxysm of diabolic and hysterical laughter. Mrs. Ward, with 3
the mingled fear and blind courage of maternity, advanced and knocked 3
affrightedly at the concealing panels, but obtained no sign of recognition. She 3
knocked again, but paused nervelessly as a second shriek arose, this one 3
unmistakably in the familiar voice of her son, and sounding concurrently with 3
the still bursting cachinnations of that other voice. Presently she fainted, 3
although she is still unable to recall the precise and immediate cause. Memory 3
sometimes makes merciful deletions. 3
3
Mr. Ward returned from the business section at about quarter past six; and not 3
finding his wife downstairs, was told by the frightened servants that she was 3
probably watching at Charles's door, from which the sounds had been far 3
stranger than ever before. Mounting the stairs at once, he saw Mrs. Ward 3
stretched out at full length on the floor of the corridor outside the laboratory; and 3
realising that she had fainted, hastened to fetch a glass of water from a set bowl 3
in a neighbouring alcove. Dashing the cold fluid in her face, he was heartened to 3
observe an immediate response on her part, and was watching the bewildered 3
opening of her eyes when a chill shot through him and threatened to reduce him 3
to the very state from which she was emerging. For the seemingly silent 3
laboratory was not as silent as it had appeared to be, but held the murmurs of a 3
tense, muffled conversation in tones too low for comprehension, yet of a quality 3
profoundly disturbing to the soul. 3
3
It was not, of course, new for Charles to mutter formulae; but this muttering was 3
definitely different. It was so palpably a dialogue, or imitation of a dialogue, with 3
the regular alteration of inflections suggesting question and answer, statement 3
and response. One voice was undisguisedly that of Charles, but the other had a 3
depth and hoUowness which the youth's best powers of ceremonial mimicry had 3
scarcely approached before. There was something hideous, blasphemous, and 3
abnormal about it, and but for a cry from his recovering wife which cleared his 3
mind by arousing his protective instincts it is not likely that Theodore Rowland 3
Ward could have maintained for nearly a year more his old boast that he had 3
never fainted. As it was, he seized his wife in his arms and bore her quickly 3
downstairs before she could notice the voices which had so horribly disturbed 3
him. Even so, however, he was not quick enough to escape catching something 3
himself which caused him to stagger dangerously with his burden. For Mrs. 3
3
3
3
349 3
3
3
3
Ward's cry had evidently been heard by others than he, and there had come in 3
response to it from behind the locked door the first distinguishable words which 3
that masked and terrible colloquy had yielded. They were merely an excited 3
caution in Charles's own voice, but somehow their implications held a nameless 3
fright for the father who overheard them. The phrase was just this: 'Sshh!-write!' 3
3
Mr. and Mrs. Ward conferred at some length after dinner, and the former 3
resolved to have a firm and serious talk with Charles that very night. No matter 3
how important the object, such conduct could no longer be permitted; for these 3
latest developments transcended every limit of sanity and formed a menace to 3
the order and nervous well-being of the entire household. The youth must 3
indeed have taken complete leave of his senses, since only downright madness 3
could have prompted the wild screams and imaginary conversations in assumed 3
voices which the present day had brought forth. All this must be stopped, or 3
Mrs. Ward would be made ill and the keeping of servants become an 3
impossibility. 3
3
Mr. Ward rose at the close of the meal and started upstairs for Charles's 3
laboratory. On the third floor, however, he paused at the sounds which he heard 3
proceeding from the now disused library of his son. Books were apparently 3
being flung about and papers wildly rustled, and upon stepping to the door Mr. 3
Ward beheld the youth within, excitedly assembling a vast armful of literary 3
matter of every size and shape. Charles's aspect was very drawn and haggard, 3
and he dropped his entire load with a start at the sound of his father's voice. At 3
the elder man's command he sat down, and for some time listened to the 3
admonitions he had so long deserved. There was no scene. At the end of the 3
lecture he agreed that his father was right, and that his noises, mutterings, 3
incantations, and chemical odours were indeed inexcusable nuisances. He agreed 3
to a policy of great quiet, though insisting on a prolongation of his extreme 3
privacy. Much of his future work, he said, was in any case purely book research; 3
and he could obtain quarters elsewhere for any such vocal rituals as might be 3
necessary at a later stage. For the fright and fainting of his mother he expressed 3
the keenest contrition, and explained that the conversation later heard was part 3
of an elaborate symbolism designed to create a certain mental atmosphere. His 3
use of abstruse technical terms somewhat bewildered Mr. Ward, but the parting 3
impression was one of undeniable sanity and poise despite a mysterious tension 3
of the utmost gravity. The interview was really quite inconclusive, and as 3
Charles picked up his armful and left the room Mr. Ward hardly knew what to 3
make of the entire business. It was as mysterious as the death of poor old Nig, 3
whose stiffening form had been found an hour before in the basement, with 3
staring eyes and fear-distorted mouth. 3

Driven by some vague detective instinct, the bewildered parent now glanced 3
curiously at the vacant shelves to see what his son had taken up to the attic. The 3
youth's library was plainly and rigidly classified, so that one might tell at a 3
glance the books or at least the kind of books which had been withdrawn. On 3
this occasion Mr. Ward was astonished to find that nothing of the occult or the 3
antiquarian, beyond what had been previously removed, was missing. These 3
new withdrawals were all modern items; histories, scientific treatises, 3
geographies, manuals of literature, philosophic works, and certain contemporary 3
newspapers and magazines. It was a very curious shift from Charles Ward's 3
recent run of reading, and the father paused in a growing vortex of perplexity 3
and an engulfing sense of strangeness. The strangeness was a very poignant 3
sensation, and almost clawed at his chest as he strove to see just what was wrong 3
around him. Something was indeed wrong, and tangibly as well as spiritually so. 3
Ever since he had been in this room he had known that something was amiss, 3
and at last it dawned upon him what it was. 3
3
On the north wall rose still the ancient carved overmantel from the house in 3
Olney Court, but to the cracked and precariously restored oils of the large 3
Curwen portrait disaster had come. Time and unequal heating had done their 3
work at last, and at some time since the room's last cleaning the worst had 3
happened. Peeling clear of the wood, curling tighter and tighter, and finally 3
crumbling into small bits with what must have been malignly silent suddenness, 3
the portrait of Joseph Curwen had resigned forever its staring surveillance of the 3
youth it so strangely resembled, and now lay scattered on the floor as a thin 3
coating of fine blue-grey dust. 3
3
IV. A Mutation and a Madness 3
3
3
3
In the week following that memorable Good Friday Charles Ward was seen more 3
often than usual, and was continually carrying books between his library and the 3
attic laboratory. His actions were quiet and rational, but he had a furtive, hunted 3
look which his mother did not like, and developed an incredibly ravenous 3
appetite as gauged by his demands upon the cook. Dr. Willett had been told of 3
those Friday noises and happenings, and on the following Tuesday had a long 3
conversation with the youth in the library where the picture stared no more. The 3
interview was, as always, inconclusive; but Willett is still ready to swear that the 3
youth was sane and himself at the time. He held out promises of an early 3
revelation, and spoke of the need of securing a laboratory elsewhere. At the loss 3
of the portrait he grieved singularly little considering his first enthusiasm over it, 3
but seemed to find something of positive humour in its sudden crumbling. 3
3
3
3
351 3
3
3
3
About the second week Charles began to be absent from the house for long 3
periods, and one day when good old black Hannah came to help with the spring 3
cleaning she mentioned his frequent visits to the old house in Olney Court, 3
where he would come with a large valise and perform curious delvings in the 3
cellar. He was always very liberal to her and to old Asa, but seemed more 3
worried than he used to be; which grieved her very much, since she had watched 3
him grow up from birth. Another report of his doings came from Pawtuxet, 3
where some friends of the family saw him at a distance a surprising number of 3
times. He seemed to haunt the resort and canoe-house of Rhodes-on-the- 3
Pawtuxet, and subsequent inquiries by Dr. Willett at that place brought out the 3
fact that his purpose was always to secure access to the rather hedged-in river- 3
bank, along which he would walk toward the north, usually not reappearing for 3
a very long while. 3
3
Late in May came a momentary revival of ritualistic sounds in the attic 3
laboratory which brought a stern reproof from Mr. Ward and a somewhat 3
distracted promise of amendment from Charles. It occurred one morning, and 3
seemed to form a resumption of the imaginary conversation noted on that 3
turbulent Good Friday. The youth was arguing or remonstrating hotly with 3
himself, for there suddenly burst forth a perfectly distinguishable series of 3
clashing shouts in differentiated tones like alternate demands and denials which 3
caused Mrs. Ward to run upstairs and listen at the door. She could hear no more 3
than a fragment whose only plain words were 'must have it red for three 3
months', and upon her knocking all sounds ceased at once. When Charles was 3
later questioned by his father he said that there were certain conflicts of spheres 3
of consciousness which only great skill could avoid, but which he would try to 3
transfer to other realms. 3
3
About the middle of June a queer nocturnal incident occurred. In the early 3
evening there had been some noise and thumping in the laboratory upstairs, and 3
Mr. Ward was on the point of investigating when it suddenly quieted down. 3
That midnight, after the family had retired, the butler was nightlocking the front 3
door when according to his statement Charles appeared somewhat blunderingly 3
and uncertainly at the foot of the stairs with a large suitcase and made signs that 3
he wished egress. The youth spoke no word, but the worthy Yorkshireman 3
caught one sight of his fevered eyes and trembled causelessly. He opened the 3
door and young Ward went out, but in the morning he presented his resignation 3
to Mrs. Ward. There was, he said, something unholy in the glance Charles had 3
fixed on him. It was no way for a young gentleman to look at an honest person, 3
and he could not possibly stay another night. Mrs. Ward allowed the man to 3
depart, but she did not value his statement highly. To fancy Charles in a savage 3
state that night was quite ridiculous, for as long as she had remained awake she 3
had heard faint sounds from the laboratory above; sounds as if of sobbing and 3
3
3
3
352 3
3
3
3
pacing, and of a sighing which told only of despair's profoundest depths. Mrs. 3
Ward had grown used to listening for sounds in the night, for the mystery of her 3
son was fast driving all else from her mind. 3
3
The next evening, much as on another evening nearly three months before, 3
Charles Ward seized the newspaper very early and accidentally lost the main 3
section. This matter was not recalled till later, when Dr. Willett began checking 3
up loose ends and searching out missing links here and there. In the Journal 3
office he found the section which Charles had lost, and marked two items as of 3
possible significance. They were as follows: 3
3
More Cemetery Delving 3
3
It was this morning discovered by Robert Hart, night watchman at the North 3
Burial Ground, that ghouls were again at work in the ancient portion of the 3
cemetery. The grave of Ezra Weeden, who was born in 1740 and died in 1824 3
according to his uprooted and savagely splintered slate headstone, was found 3
excavated and rifled, the work being evidently done with a spade stolen from an 3
adjacent tool-shed. 3
3
Whatever the contents may have been after more than a century of burial, all was 3
gone except a few slivers of decayed wood. There were no wheel tracks, but the 3
police have measured a single set of footprints which they found in the vicinity, 3
and which indicate the boots of a man of refinement. 3
3
Hart is inclined to link this incident with the digging discovered last March, 3
when a party in a motor truck were frightened away after making a deep 3
excavation; but Sergt. Riley of the Second Station discounts this theory and 3
points to vital differences in the two cases. In March the digging had been in a 3
spot where no grave was known; but this time a well-marked and cared-for 3
grave had been rifled with every evidence of deliberate purpose, and with a 3
conscious malignity expressed in the splintering of the slab which had been 3
intact up to the day before. 3
3
Members of the Weeden family, notified of the happening, expressed their 3
astonishment and regret; and were wholly unable to think of any enemy who 3
would care to violate the grave of their ancestor. Hazard Weeden of 598 Angell 3
Street recalls a family legend according to which Ezra Weeden was involved in 3
some very peculiar circumstances, not dishonourable to himself, shortly before 3
the Revolution; but of any modern feud or mystery he is frankly ignorant. 3
Inspector Cunningham has been assigned to the case, and hopes to uncover some 3
valuable clues in the near future. 3

Dogs Noisy in Pawtuxet 3
3
Residents of Pawtuxet were aroused about 3 a.m. today by a phenomenal baying 3
of dogs which seemed to centre near the river just north of Rhodes-on-the- 3
Pawtuxet. The volume and quality of the howling were unusually odd, 3
according to most who heart it; and Fred Lemdin, night watchman at Rhodes, 3
declares it was mixed with something very like the shrieks of a man in mortal 3
terror and agony. A sharp and very brief thunderstorm, which seemed to strike 3
somewhere near the bank of the river, put an end to the disturbance. Strange and 3
unpleasant odours, probably from the oil tanks along the bay, are popularly 3
linked with this incident; and may have had their share in exciting the dogs. 3
3
The aspect of Charles now became very haggard and hunted, and all agreed in 3
retrospect that he may have wished at this period to make some statement or 3
confession from which sheer terror withheld him. The morbid listening of his 3
mother in the night brought out the fact that he made frequent sallies abroad 3
under cover of darkness, and most of the more academic alienists unite at 3
present in charging him with the revolting cases of vampirism which the press so 3
sensationally reported about this time, but which have not yet been definitely 3
traced to any known perpetrator. These cases, too recent and celebrated to need 3
detailed mention, involved victims of every age and type and seemed to cluster 3
around two distinct localities; the residential hill and the North End, near the 3
Ward home, and the suburban districts across the Cranston line near Pawtuxet. 3
Both late wayfarers and sleepers with open windows were attacked, and those 3
who lived to tell the tale spoke unanimously of a lean, lithe, leaping monster 3
with burning eyes which fastened its teeth in the throat or upper arm and feasted 3
ravenously. 3
3
Dr. Willett, who refuses to date the madness of Charles Ward as far back as even 3
this, is cautious in attempting to explain these horrors. He has, he declares, 3
certain theories of his own; and limits his positive statements to a peculiar kind 3
of negation: 'I will not,' he says, 'state who or what I believe perpetrated these 3
attacks and murders, but I will declare that Charles Ward was innocent of them. I 3
have reason to be sure he was ignorant of the taste of blood, as indeed his 3
continued anaemic decline and increasing pallor prove better than any verbal 3
argument. Ward meddled with terrible things, but he has paid for it, and he was 3
never a monster or a villain. As for now - I don't like to think. A change came, 3
and I'm content to believe that the old Charles Ward died with it. His soul did, 3
anyhow, for that mad flesh that vanished from Waite's hospital had another.' 3
3
Willett speaks with authority, for he was often at the Ward home attending Mrs. 3
Ward, whose nerves had begun to snap under the strain. Her nocturnal listening 3
had bred some morbid hallucinations which she confided to the doctor with 3
3
3
3
354 3
3
3
3
hesitancy, and which he ridiculed in talking to her, although they made him 3
ponder deeply when alone. These delusions always concerning the faint sounds 3
which she fancied she heard in the attic laboratory and bedroom, and 3
emphasised the occurrence of muffled sighs and sobbings at the most impossible 3
times. Early in July Willett ordered Mrs. Ward to Atlantic City for an indefinite 3
recuperative sojourn, and cautioned both Mr. Ward and the haggard and elusive 3
Charles to write her only cheering letters. It is probably to this enforced and 3
reluctant escape that she owes her life and continued sanity. 3
3
3
3
Not long after his mother's departure, Charles Ward began negotiating for the 3
Pawtuxet bungalow. It was a squalid little wooden edifice with a concrete 3
garage, perched high on the sparsely settled bank of the river slightly above 3
Rhodes, but for some odd reason the youth would have nothing else. He gave 3
the real-estate agencies no peace till one of them secured it for him at an 3
exorbitant price from a somewhat reluctant owner, and as soon as it was vacant 3
he took possession under cover of darkness,, transporting in a great closed van 3
the entire contents of his attic laboratory, including the books both weird and 3
modern which he had borrowed from his study. He had this van loaded in the 3
black small hours, and his father recalls only a drowsy realisation of stifled oaths 3
and stamping feet on the night the goods were taken away. After that Charles 3
moved back to his own old quarters on the third floor, and never haunted the 3
attic again. 3
3
To the Pawtuxet bungalow Charles transferred all the secrecy with which he had 3
surrounded his attic realm, save that he now appeared to have two sharers of his 3
mysteries; a villainous-looking Portuguese half-caste from the South Main St. 3
waterfront who acted as a servant, and a thin, scholarly stranger with dark 3
glasses and a stubbly full beard of dyed aspect whose status was evidently that 3
of a colleague. Neighbours vainly tried to engage these odd persons in 3
conversation. The mulatto Gomes spoke very little English, and the bearded 3
man, who gave his name as Dr. Allen, voluntarily followed his example. Ward 3
himself tried to be more affable, but succeeded only in provoking curiousity with 3
his rambling accounts of chemical research. Before long queer tales began to 3
circulate regarding the all-night burning of lights; and somewhat later, after this 3
burning had suddenly ceased, there rose still queerer tales of disproportionate 3
orders of meat from the butcher's and of the muffled shouting, declamation, 3
rhythmic chanting, and screaming supposed to come from some very cellar 3
below the place. Most distinctly the new and strange household was bitterly 3
disliked by the honest bourgeoisie of the vicinity, and it is not remarkable that 3
dark hints were advanced connecting the hated establishment with the current 3
epidemic of vampiristic attacks and murders; especially since the radius of that 3
3
3
3
355 3
3
3
3
plague seemed now confined wholly to Pawtuxet and the adjacent streets of 3
Edgewood. 3
3
Ward spent most of his time at the bungalow, but slept occasionally at home and 3
was still reckoned a dweller beneath his father's roof. Twice he was absent from 3
the city on week-long trips, whose destinations have not yet been discovered. He 3
grew steadily paler and more emaciated even than before, and lacked some of his 3
former assurance when repeating to Dr. Willett his old, old story of vital research 3
and future revelations. Willett often waylaid him at his father's house, for the 3
elder Ward was deeply worried and perplexed, and wished his son to get as 3
much sound oversight as could be managed in the case of so secretive and 3
independent an adult. The doctor still insists that the youth was sane even as late 3
as this, and adduces many a conversation to prove his point. 3
3
About September the vampirism declined, but in the following January almost 3
became involved in serious trouble. For some time the nocturnal arrival and 3
departure of motor trucks at the Pawtuxet bungalow had been commented upon, 3
and at this juncture an unforeseen hitch exposed the nature of at least one item of 3
their contents. In a lonely spot near Hope Valley had occurred one of the 3
frequent sordid waylaying of trucks by "hi-jackers" in quest of liquor shipments, 3
but this time the robbers had been destined to receive the greater shock. For the 3
long cases they seized proved upon opening to contain some exceedingly 3
gruesome things; so gruesome, in fact, that the matter could not be kept quiet 3
amongst the denizens of the underworld. The thieves had hastily buried what 3
they discovered, but when the State Police got wind of the matter a careful search 3
was made. A recently arrived vagrant, under promise of immunity from 3
prosecution on any additional charge, at last consented to guide a party of 3
troopers to the spot; and there was found in that hasty cache a very hideous and 3
shameful thing. It would not be well for the national - or even the international - 3
sense of decorum if the public were ever to know what was uncovered by that 3
awestruck party. There was no mistaking it, even by those far from studious 3
officers; and telegrams to Washington ensued with feverish rapidity. 3
3
The cases were addressed to Charles Ward at his Pawtuxet bungalow, and State 3
and Federal officials at once paid him a very forceful and serious call. They 3
found him pallid and worried with his two odd companions, and received from 3
him what seemed to be a valid explanation and evidence of innocence. He had 3
needed certain anatomical specimens as part of a programme of research whose 3
depth and genuineness anyone who had known him in the last decade could 3
prove, and had ordered the required kind and number from agencies which he 3
had thought as reasonably legitimate as such things can be. Of the identity of the 3
specimens he had known absolutely nothing, and was properly shocked when 3
the inspectors hinted at the monstrous effect on public sentiment and national 3
3
3
3
356 3
3
3
3
dignity which a knowledge of the matter would produce. In this statement he 3
was firmly sustained by his bearded colleague Dr. Allen, whose oddly hollow 3
voice carried even more conviction than his own nervous tones; so that in the 3
end the officials took no action, but carefully set down the New York name and 3
address which Ward gave them a basis for a search which came to nothing. It is 3
only fair to add that the specimens were quickly and quietly restored to their 3
proper places, and that the general public will never know of their blasphemous 3
disturbance. 3
3
On February 9, 1928, Dr. Willett received a letter from Charles Ward which he 3
considers of extraordinary importance, and about which he has frequently 3
quarrelled with Dr. Lyman. Lyman believes that this note contains positive proof 3
of a well-developed case of dementia praecox, but Willett on the other hand 3
regards it as the last perfectly sane utterance of the hapless youth. He calls 3
especial attention to the normal character of the penmanship; which though 3
shewing traces of shattered nerves, is nevertheless distinctly Ward's own. The 3
text in full is as follows: 3
3
100 Prospect St. 3
3
Providence, R.I., 3
3
February 8, 1928. 3
3
Dear Dr. Willett:- 3
3
I feel that at last the time has come for me to make the disclosures which I have 3
so long promised you, and for which you have pressed me so often. The patience 3
you have shewn in waiting, and the confidence you have shewn in my mind and 3
integrity, are things I shall never cease to appreciate. 3
3
And now that I am ready to speak, I must own with humiliation that no triumph 3
such as I dreamed of can ever by mine. Instead of triumph I have found terror, 3
and my talk with you will not be a boast of victory but a plea for help and advice 3
in saving both myself and the world from a horror beyond all human conception 3
or calculation. You recall what those Fenner letters said of the old raiding party 3
at Pawtuxet. That must all be done again, and quickly. Upon us depends more 3
than can be put into words - all civilisation, all natural law, perhaps even the fate 3
of the solar system and the universe. I have brought to light a monstrous 3
abnormality, but I did it for the sake of knowledge. Now for the sake of all life 3
and Nature you must help me thrust it back into the dark again. 3
3
I have left that Pawtuxet place forever, and we must extirpate everything 3
existing there, alive or dead. I shall not go there again, and you must not believe 3
it if you ever hear that I am there. I will tell you why I say this when I see you. I 3
3
3
3
357 3
3
3
3
have come home for good, and wish you would call on me at the very first 3
moment that you can spare five or six hours continuously to hear what I have to 3
say. It will take that long - and believe me when I tell you that you never had a 3
more genuine professional duty than this. My life and reason are the very least 3
things which hang in the balance. 3
3
I dare not tell my father, for he could not grasp the whole thing. But I have told 3
him of my danger, and he has four men from a detective agency watching the 3
house. I don't know how much good they can do, for they have against them 3
forces which even you could scarcely envisage or acknowledge. So come quickly 3
if you wish to see me alive and hear how you may help to save the cosmos from 3
stark hell. 3
3
Any time will do - I shall not be out of the house. Don't telephone ahead, for 3
there is no telling who or what may try to intercept you. And let us pray to 3
whatever gods there be that nothing may prevent this meeting. 3
3
In utmost gravity and desperation, 3
3
Charles Dexter Ward. 3
3
P.S. Shoot Dr. Allen on sight and dissolve his body in acid. Don't burn it. 3
3
Dr. Willett received this note about 10:30 a.m., and immediately arranged to 3
spare the whole late afternoon and evening for the momentous talk, letting it 3
extend on into the night as long as might be necessary. He planned to arrive 3
about four o'clock, and through all the intervening hours was so engulfed in 3
every sort of wild speculation that most of his tasks were very mechanically 3
performed. Maniacal as the letter would have sounded to a stranger, Willett had 3
seen too much of Charles Ward's oddities to dismiss it as sheer raving. That 3
something very subtle, ancient, and horrible was hovering about he felt quite 3
sure, and the reference to Dr. Allen could almost be comprehended in view of 3
what Pawtuxet gossip said of Ward's enigmatical colleague. Willett had never 3
seen the man, but had heard much of his aspect and bearing, and could not but 3
wonder what sort of eyes those much-discussed dark glasses might conceal. 3
3
Promptly at four Dr. Willett presented himself at the Ward residence, but found 3
to his annoyance that Charles had not adhered to his determination to remain 3
indoors. The guards were there, but said that the young man seemed to have lost 3
part of his timidity. He had that morning done much apparently frightened 3
arguing and protesting over the telephone, one of the detectives said, replying to 3
some unknown voice with phrases such as 'I am very tired and must rest a 3
while', 'I can't receive anyone for some time', 'you'll have to excuse me', 'Please 3
3
3
3
358 3
3
3
3
postpone decisive action till we can arrange some sort of compromise', or 'I am 3
very sorry, but I must take a complete vacation from everything; I'll talk with 3
you later.' Then, apparently gaining boldness through meditation, he had 3
slipped out so quietly that no one had seen him depart or knew that he had gone 3
until he returned about one o'clock and entered the house without a word. He 3
had gone upstairs, where a bit of his fear must have surged back; for he was 3
heard to cry out in a highly terrified fashion upon entering his library, afterward 3
trailing off into a kind of choking gasp. When, however, the butler had gone to 3
inquire what the trouble was, he had appeared at the door with a great show of 3
boldness, and had silently gestured the man away in a manner that terrified him 3
unaccountably. Then he had evidently done some rearranging of his shelves, for 3
a great clattering and thumping and creaking ensued; after which he had 3
reappeared and left at once. Willett inquired whether or not any message had 3
been left, but was told that there was no none. The butler seemed queerly 3
disturbed about something in Charles's appearance and manner, and asked 3
solicitously if there was much hope for a cure of his disordered nerves. 3
3
For almost two hours Dr. Willett waited vainly in Charles Ward's library, 3
watching the dusty shelves with their wide gaps where books had been 3
removed, and smiling grimly at the panelled overmantel on the north wall, 3
whence a year before the suave features of old Joseph Curwen had looked mildly 3
down. After a time the shadows began to gather, and the sunset cheer gave place 3
to a vague growing terror which flew shadow-like before the night. Mr. Ward 3
finally arrived, and shewed much surprise and anger at his son's absence after all 3
the pains which had been taken to guard him. He had not known of Charles's 3
appointment, and promised to notify Willett when the youth returned. In 3
bidding the doctor goodnight he expressed his utter perplexity at his son's 3
condition, and urged his caller to do all he could to restore the boy to normal 3
poise. Willett was glad to escape from that library, for something frightful and 3
unholy seemed to haunt it; as if the vanished picture had left behind a legacy of 3
evil. He had never liked that picture; and even now, strong-nerved though he 3
was, there lurked a quality in its vacant panel which made him feel an urgent 3
need to get out into the pure air as soon as possible. 3
3
3
3
The next morning Willett received a message from the senior Ward, saying that 3
Charles was still absent. Mr. Ward mentioned that Dr. Allen had telephoned him 3
to say that Charles would remain at Pawtuxet for some time, and that he must 3
not be disturbed. This was necessary because Allen himself was suddenly called 3
away for an indefinite period, leaving the researches in need of Charles's 3
constant oversight. Charles sent his best wishes, and regretted any bother his 3
abrupt change of plans might have caused. It listening to this message Mr. Ward 3
3
3
3
359 3
3
3
3
heard Dr. Allen's voice for the first time, and it seemed to excite some vague and 3
elusive memory which could not be actually placed, but which was disturbing to 3
the point of tearfulness. 3
3
Faced by these baffling and contradictory reports. Dr. Willett was frankly at a 3
loss what to do. The frantic earnestness of Charles's note was not to be denied, 3
yet what could one think of its writer's immediate violation of his own expressed 3
policy? Young Ward had written that his delvings had become blasphemous and 3
menacing, that they and his bearded colleague must be extirpated at any cost, 3
and that he himself would never return to their final scene; yet according to latest 3
advices he had forgotten all this and was back in the thick of the mystery. 3
Common sense bade one leave the youth alone with his freakishness, yet some 3
deeper instinct would not permit the impression of that frenzied letter to 3
subside. Willett read it over again, and could not make its essence sound as 3
empty and insane as both its bombastic verbiage and its lack of fulfilment would 3
seem to imply. Its terror was too profound and real, and in conjunction with 3
what the doctor already knew evoked too vivid hints of monstrosities from 3
beyond time and space to permit of any cynical explanation. There were 3
nameless horrors abroad; and no matter how little one might be able to get at 3
them, one ought to stand prepared for any sort of action at any time. 3
3
For over a week Dr. Willett pondered on the dilemma which seemed thrust upon 3
him, and became more and more inclined to pay Charles a call at the Pawtuxet 3
bungalow. No friend of the youth had ever ventured to storm this forbidden 3
retreat, and even his father knew of its interior only from such descriptions as he 3
chose to give; but Willett felt that some direct conversation with his patient was 3
necessary. Mr. Ward had been receiving brief and non-committal typed notes 3
from his son, and said that Mrs. Ward in her Atlantic City retirement had had no 3
better word. So at length the doctor resolved to act; and despite a curious 3
sensation inspired by old legends of Joseph Curwen, and by more recent 3
revelations and warnings from Charles Ward, set boldly out for the bungalow on 3
the bluff above the river. 3
3
Willett had visited the spot before through sheer curiousity, though of course 3
never entering the house or proclaiming his presence; hence knew exactly the 3
route to take. Driving out Broad Street one early afternoon toward the end of 3
February in his small motor, he thought oddly of the grim party which had taken 3
that selfsame road a hundred and fifty-seven years before on a terrible errand 3
which none might ever comprehend. 3
3
The ride through the city's decaying fringe was short, and trim Edgewood and 3
sleepy Pawtuxet presently spread out ahead. Willett turned to the right down 3
Lockwood Street and drove his car as far along that rural road as he could, then 3
3
3
3
360 3
3
3
3
alighted and walked north to where the bluff towered above the lovely bends of 3
the river and the sweep of misty downlands beyond. Houses were still few here, 3
and there was no mistaking the isolated bungalow with its concrete garage on a 3
high point of land at his left. Stepping briskly up the neglected gravel walk he 3
rapped at the door with a firm hand, and spoke without a tremor to the evil 3
Portuguese mulatto who opened it to the width of a crack. 3
3
He must, he said, see Charles Ward at once on vitally important business. No 3
excuse would be accepted, and a repulse would mean only a full report of the 3
matter to the elder Ward. The mulatto still hesitated, and pushed against the 3
door when Willett attempted to open it; but the doctor merely raised his voice 3
and renewed his demands. Then there came from the dark interior a husky 3
whisper which somehow chilled the hearer through and through though he did 3
not know why he feared it. 'Let him in, Tony,' it said, 'we may as well talk now 3
as ever.' But disturbing as was the whisper, the greater fear was that which 3
immediately followed. The floor creaked and the speaker hove in sight - and the 3
owner of those strange and resonant tones was seen to be no other than Charles 3
Dexter Ward. 3
3
The minuteness with which Dr. Willett recalled and recorded his conversation of 3
that afternoon is due to the importance he assigns to this particular period. For at 3
last he concedes a vital change in Charles Dexter Ward's mentality, and believes 3
that the youth now spoke from a brain hopelessly alien to the brain whose 3
growth he had watched for six and twenty years. Controversy with Dr. Lyman 3
has compelled him to be very specific, and he definitely dates the madness of 3
Charles Ward from the time the typewritten notes began to reach his parents. 3
Those notes are not in Ward's normal style; not even in the style of that last 3
frantic letter to Willett. Instead, they are strange and archaic, as if the snapping of 3
the writer's mind had released a flood of tendencies and impressions picked up 3
unconsciously through boyhood antiquarianism. There is an obvious effort to be 3
modern, but the spirit and occasionally the language are those of the past. 3
3
The past, too, was evident in Ward's every tone and gesture as he received the 3
doctor in that shadowy bungalow. He bowed, motioned Willett to a seat, and 3
began to speak abruptly in that strange whisper which he sought to explain at 3
the very outset. 3
3
'I am grown phthisical,' he began, 'from this cursed river air. You must excuse 3
my speech. I suppose you are come from my father to see what ails me, and I 3
hope you will say nothing to alarm him.' 3
3
Willett was studying these scraping tones with extreme care, but studying even 3
more closely the face of the speaker. Something, he felt, was wrong; and he 3
3
3
3
361 3
3
3
3
thought of what the family had told him about the fright of that Yorkshire butler 3
one night. He wished it were not so dark, but did not request that the blind be 3
opened. Instead, he merely asked Ward why he had so belied the frantic note of 3
little more than a week before. 3
3
'I was coming to that,' the host replied. 'You must know, I am in a very bad state 3
of nerves, and do and say queer things I cannot account for. As I have told you 3
often, I am on the edge of great matters; and the bigness of them has a way of 3
making me light-headed. Any man might well be frighted of what I have found, 3
but I am not to be put off for long. I was a dunce to have that guard and stick at 3
home; for having gone this far, my place is here. I am not well spoke of my 3
prying neighbours, and perhaps I was led by weakness to believe myself what 3
they say of me. There is no evil to any in what I do, so long as I do it rightly. 3
Have the goodness to wait six months, and I'll shew you what will pay your 3
patience well.' 3
3
'You may as well know I have a way of learning old matters from things surer 3
than books, and I'll leave you to judge the importance of what I can give to 3
history, philosophy, and the arts by reason of the doors I have access to. My 3
ancestor had all this when those witless peeping Toms came and murdered him. 3
I now have it again, or am coming very imperfectly to have a part of it. This time 3
nothing must happen, and least of all though any idiot fears of my own. Pray 3
forget all I writ you. Sir, and have no fear of this place or any in it. Dr. Allen is a 3
man of fine parts, and I own him an apology for anything ill I have said of him. I 3
wish I had no need to spare him, but there were things he had to do elsewhere. 3
His zeal is equal to mine in all those matters, and I suppose that when I feared 3
the work I feared him too as my greatest helper in it.' 3
3
Ward paused, and the doctor hardly knew what to say or think. He felt almost 3
foolish in the face of this calm repudiation of the letter; and yet there clung to 3
him the fact that while the present discourse was strange and alien and 3
indubitably mad, the note itself had been tragic in its naturalness and likeness to 3
the Charles Ward he knew. Willett now tried to turn the talk on early matters, 3
and recall to the youth some past events which would restore a familiar mood; 3
but in this process he obtained only the most grotesque results. It was the same 3
with all the alienists later on. Important sections of Charles Ward's store of 3
mental images, mainly those touching modern times and his own personal life, 3
had been unaccountably expunged; whilst all the massed antiquarianism of his 3
youth had welled up from some profound subconsciousness to engulf the 3
contemporary and the individual. The youth's intimate knowledge of elder 3
things was abnormal and unholy, and he tried his best to hide it. When Willett 3
would mention some favourite object of his boyhood archaistic studies he often 3
3
3
3
362 3
3
3
3
shed by pure accident such a hght as no normal mortal could conceivably be 3
expected to possess, and the doctor shuddered as the glib allusion glided by. 3
3
It was not wholesome to know so much about the way the fat sheriff's wig fell off 3
as he leaned over at the play in Mr. Douglass's Histrionick Academy in King 3
Street on the eleventh of February, 1762, which fell on a Thursday; or about how 3
the actors cut the text of Steele's Conscious Lover so badly that one was almost 3
glad the Baptist-ridden legislature closed the theatre a fortnight later. That 3
Thomas Sabin's Boston coach was "damn'd uncomfortable" old letters may well 3
have told; but what healthy antiquarian could recall how the creaking of 3
Epenetus Olney's new signboard (the gaudy crown he set up after he took to 3
calling his tavern the Crown Coffee House) was exactly like the first few notes of 3
the new jazz piece all the radios in Pawtuxet were playing? 3
3
Ward, however, would not be quizzed long in this vein. Modern and personal 3
topics he waved aside quite summarily, whilst regarding antique affairs he soon 3
shewed the plainest boredom. What he wished clearly enough was only to 3
satisfy his visitor enough to make him depart without the intention of returning. 3
To this end he offered to shew Willett the entire house, and at once proceeded to 3
lead the doctor through every room from cellar to attic. Willett looked sharply, 3
but noted that the visible books were far too few and trivial to have ever filled 3
the wide gaps on Ward's shelves at home, and that the meagre so-called 3
"laboratory" was the flimsiest sort of a blind. Clearly, there were a library and a 3
laboratory elsewhere; but just where, it was impossible to say. Essentially 3
defeated in his quest for something he could not name, Willett returned to town 3
before evening and told the senior Ward everything which had occurred. They 3
agreed that the youth must be definitely out of his mind, but decided that 3
nothing drastic need be done just then. Above all, Mrs. Ward must be kept in as 3
complete an ignorance as her son's own strange typed notes would permit. 3
3
Mr. Ward now determined to call in person upon his son, making it wholly a 3
surprise visit. Dr. Willett took him in his car one evening, guiding him to within 3
sight of the bungalow and waiting patiently for his return. The session was a 3
long one, and the father emerged in a very saddened and perplexed state. His 3
reception had developed much like Willett's, save that Charles had been an 3
excessively long time in appearing after the visitor had forced his way into the 3
hall and sent the Portuguese away with an imperative demand; and in the 3
bearing of the altered son there was no trace of filial affection. The lights had 3
been dim, yet even so the youth had complained that they dazzled him 3
outrageously. He had not spoken out loud at all, averring that his throat was in 3
very poor condition; but in his hoarse whisper there was a quality so vaguely 3
disturbing that Mr. Ward could not banish it from his mind. 3
3
3
3
363 3
3
3
3
Now definitely leagued together to do all they could toward the youth's mental 3
salvation, Mr. Ward and Dr. Willett set about collecting every scrap of data 3
which the case might afford. Pawtuxet gossip was the first item they studied, and 3
this was relatively easy to glean since both had friends in that region. Dr. Willett 3
obtained the most rumours because people talked more frankly to him than to a 3
parent of the central figure, and from all he heard he could tell that young 3
Ward's life had become indeed a strange one. Common tongues would not 3
dissociate his household from the vampirism of the previous summer, while the 3
nocturnal comings and goings of the motor trucks provided their share of dark 3
speculations. Local tradesmen spoke of the queerness of the orders brought them 3
by the evil-looking mulatto, and in particular of the inordinate amounts of mean 3
and fresh blood secured from the two butcher shops in the immediate 3
neighbourhood. For a household of only three, these quantities were quite 3
absurd. 3
3
Then there was the matter of the sounds beneath the earth. Reports of these 3
things were harder to point down, but all the vague hints tallied in certain basic 3
essentials. Noises of a ritual nature positively existed, and at times when the 3
bungalow was dark. They might, of course, have come from the known cellar; 3
but rumour insisted that there were deeper and more spreading crypts. Recalling 3
the ancient tales of Joseph Curwen's catacombs, and assuming for granted that 3
the present bungalow had been selected because of its situation on the old 3
Curwen site as revealed in one of another of the documents found behind the 3
picture, Willett and Mr. Ward gave this phase of the gossip much attention; and 3
searched many times without success for the door in the river-bank which old 3
manuscripts mentioned. As to popular opinions of the bungalow's various 3
inhabitants, it was soon plain that the Brava Portuguese was loathed, the 3
bearded and spectacled Dr. Allen feared, and the pallid young scholar disliked to 3
a profound degree. During the last week or two Ward had obviously changed 3
much, abandoning his attempts at affability and speaking only in hoarse but 3
oddly repellent whispers on the few occasions that he ventured forth. 3
3
Such were the shreds and fragments gathered here and there; and over these Mr. 3
Ward and Dr. Willett held many long and serious conferences. They strove to 3
exercise deduction, induction, and constructive imagination to their utmost 3
extent; and to correlate every known fact of Charles's later life, including the 3
frantic letter which the doctor now shewed the father, with the meagre 3
documentary evidence available concerning old Joseph Curwen. They would 3
have given much for a glimpse of the papers Charles had found, for very clearly 3
the key to the youth's madness lay in what he had learned of the ancient wizard 3
and his doings. 3
3
3
3
364 3
3
3
3
And yet, after all, it was from no step of Mr. Ward's or Dr. Willett's that the next 3
move in this singular case proceeded. The father and the physician, rebuffed and 3
confused by a shadow too shapeless and intangible to combat, had rested 3
uneasily on their oars while the typed notes of young Ward to his parents grew 3
fewer and fewer. Then came the first of the month with its customary financial 3
adjustments, and the clerks at certain banks began a peculiar shaking of heads 3
and telephoning from one to the other. Officials who knew Charles Ward by 3
sight went down to the bungalow to ask why every cheque of his appearing at 3
this juncture was a clumsy forgery, and were reassured less than they ought to 3
have been when the youth hoarsely explained that he hand had lately been so 3
much affected by a nervous shock as to make normal writing impossible. He 3
could, he said, from no written characters at all except with great difficulty; and 3
could prove it by the fact that he had been forced to type all his recent letters, 3
even those to his father and mother, who would bear out the assertion. 3
3
What made the investigators pause in confusion was not this circumstance alone, 3
for that was nothing unprecedented or fundamentally suspicious, nor even the 3
Pawtuxet gossip, of which one or two of them had caught echoes. It was the 3
muddled discourse of the young man which nonplussed them, implying as it did 3
a virtually total loss of memory concerning important monetary matters which 3
he had had at his fingertips only a month or two before. Something was wrong; 3
for despite the apparent coherence and rationality of his speech, there could be 3
no normal reason for this ill-concealed blankness on vital points. Moreover, 3
although none of these men knew Ward well, they could not help observing the 3
change in his language and manner. They had heard he was an antiquarian, but 3
even the most hopeless antiquarians do not make daily use of obsolete 3
phraseology and gestures. Altogether, this combination of hoarseness, palsied 3
hands, bad memory, and altered speech and bearing must represent some 3
disturbance or malady of genuine gravity, which no doubt formed the basis of 3
the prevailing odd rumours; and after their departure the party of officials 3
decided that a talk with the senior Ward was imperative. 3
3
So on the sixth of March, 1928, there was a long and serious conference in Mr. 3
Ward's office, after which the utterly bewildered father summoned Dr. Willett in 3
a kind of helpless resignation. Willett looked over the strained and awkward 3
signatures of the cheque, and compared them in his mind with the penmanship 3
of that last frantic note. Certainly, the change was radical and profound, and yet 3
there was something damnably familiar about the new writing. It had crabbed 3
and archaic tendencies of a very curious sort, and seemed to result from a type of 3
stroke utterly different from that which the youth had always used. It was 3
strange - but where had he seen it before? On the whole, it was obvious that 3
Charles was insane. Of that there could be no doubt. And since it appeared 3
unlikely that he could handle his property or continue to deal with the outside 3
3
3
3
365 3
3
3
3
world much longer, something must quickly be done toward his oversight and 3
possible cure. It was then that the alienists were called in, Drs. Peck and Waite of 3
Providence and Dr. Lyman of Boston, to whom Mr. Ward and Dr. Willett gave 3
the most exhaustive possible history of the case, and who conferred at length in 3
the now unused library of their young patient, examining what books and 3
papers of his were left in order to gain some further notion of his habitual mental 3
cast. After scanning this material and examining the ominous note to Willett they 3
all agreed that Charles Ward's studies had been enough to unseat or at least to 3
warp any ordinary intellect, and wished most heartily that they could see his 3
more intimate volumes and documents; but this latter they knew they could do, 3
if at all, only after a scene at the bungalow itself. Willett now reviewed the whole 3
case with febrile energy; it being at this time that he obtained the statements of 3
the workmen who had seen Charles find the Curwen documents, and that he 3
collated the incidents of the destroyed newspaper items, looking up the latter at 3
the Journal office. 3
3
On Thursday, the eighth of March, Drs. Willett, Peck, Lyman, and Waite, 3
accompanied by Mr. Ward, paid the youth their momentous call; making no 3
concealment of their object and questioning the now acknowledged patient with 3
extreme minuteness. Charles, although he was inordinately long in answering 3
the summons and was still redolent of strange and noxious laboratory odours 3
when he did finally make his agitated appearance, proved a far from recalcitrant 3
subject; and admitted freely that his memory and balance had suffered 3
somewhat from close application to abstruse studies. He offered no resistance 3
when his removal to other quarters was insisted upon; and seemed, indeed, to 3
display a high degree of intelligence as apart from mere memory. His conduct 3
would have sent his interviewers away in bafflement had not the persistently 3
archaic trend of his speech and unmistakable replacement of modern by ancient 3
ideas in his consciousness marked him out as one definitely removed from the 3
normal. Of his work he would say no more to the group of doctors than he had 3
formerly said to his family and to Dr. Willett, and his frantic note of the previous 3
month he dismissed as mere nerves and hysteria. He insisted that this shadowy 3
bungalow possessed no library possessed no library or laboratory beyond the 3
visible ones, and waxed abstruse in explaining the absence from the house of 3
such odours as now saturated all his clothing. Neighbourhood gossip he 3
attributed to nothing more than the cheap inventiveness of baffled curiousity. Of 3
the whereabouts of Dr. Allen he said he did not feel at liberty to speak definitely, 3
but assured his inquisitors that the bearded and spectacled man would return 3
when needed. In paying off the stolid Brava who resisted all questioning by the 3
visitors, and in closing the bungalow which still seemed to hold such nighted 3
secrets. Ward shewed no signs of nervousness save a barely noticed tendency to 3
pause as though listening for something very faint. He was apparently animated 3
by a calmly philosophic resignation, as if he removal were the merest transient 3
3
3
3
366 3
3
3
3
incident which would cause the least trouble if facilitated and disposed of once 3
and for all. It was clear that he trusted to his obviously unimpaired keenness of 3
absolute mentality to overcome all the embarrassments into which his twisted 3
memory, his lost voice and handwriting, and his secretive and eccentric 3
behaviour had led him. His mother, it was agreed, was not to be told of the 3
change; his father supplying typed notes in his name. Ward was taken to the 3
restfuUy and picturesquely situated private hospital maintained by Dr. Waite on 3
Conanicut Island in the bay, and subjected to the closest scrutiny and 3
questioning by all the physicians connected with the case. It was then that the 3
physical oddities were noticed; the slackened metabolism, the altered skin, and 3
the disproportionate neural reactions. Dr. Willett was the most perturbed of the 3
various examiners, for he had attended Ward all his life and could appreciate 3
with terrible keenness the extent of his physical disorganisation. Even the 3
familiar olive mark on his hip was gone, while on his chest was a great black 3
mole or cicatrice which had never been there before, and which made Willett 3
wonder whether the youth had ever submitted to any of the witch markings 3
reputed to be inflicted at certain unwholesome nocturnal meetings in wild and 3
lonely places. The doctor could not keep his mind off a certain transcribed witch- 3
trial record from Salem which Charles had shewn him in the old non-secretive 3
days, and which read: 'Mr. G. B. on that Nighte putt ye Divell his Marke upon 3
Bridget S., Jonathan A., Simon O., Deliverance W., Joseph C, Susan P., Mehitable 3
C, and Deborah B.' Ward's face, too, troubled him horribly, till at length he 3
suddenly discovered why he was horrified. For above the young man's right eye 3
was something which he had never previously noticed - a small scar or pit 3
precisely like that in the crumbled painting of old Joseph Curwen, and perhaps 3
attesting some hideous ritualistic inoculation to which both had submitted at a 3
certain stage of their occult careers. 3
3
While Ward himself was puzzling all the doctors at the hospital a very strict 3
watch was kept on all mail addressed either to him or to Dr. Allen, which Mr. 3
Ward had ordered delivered at the family home. Willett had predicted that very 3
little would be found, since any communications of a vital nature would 3
probably have been exchanged by messenger; but in the latter part of March 3
there did come a letter from Prague for Dr. Allen which gave both the doctor and 3
the father deep thought. It was in a very crabbed and archaic hand; and though 3
clearly not the effort of a foreigner, shewed almost as singular a departure from 3
modern English as the speech of young Ward himself. It read: 3

3
Mr. Ward and Dr. Willett paused in utter chaos before this apparent bit of 3
unrelieved insanity. Only by degrees did they absorb what it seemed to imply. 3
So the absent Dr. Allen, and not Charles Ward, had come to be the leading spirit 3
at Pawtuxet? That must explain the wild reference and denunciation in the 3
youth's last frantic letter. And what of this addressing of the bearded and 3
spectacled stranger as "Mr. J. C"? There was no escaping the inference, but there 3
are limits to possible monstrosity. Who was "Simon O."; the old man Ward had 3
visited in Prague four years previously? Perhaps, but in the centuries behind 3
there had been another Simon O. - Simon Orne, alias Jedediah, of Salem, who 3
vanished in 1771, and whose peculiar handwriting Dr. Willett now unmistakably 3
recognised from the photostatic copies of the Orne formulae which Charles had 3
once shown him. What horrors and mysteries, what contradictions and 3
contraventions of Nature, had come back after a century and a half to harass Old 3
Providence with her clustered spires and domes? 3
3
The father and the old physician, virtually at a loss what to do or think, went to 3
see Charles at the hospital and questioned him as delicately as they could about 3
Dr. Allen, about the Prague visit, and about what he had learned of Simon or 3
3
3
3
368 3
3
3
3
Jedediah Orne of Salem. To all these enquiries the youth was politely non- 3
committal, merely barking in his hoarse whisper that he had found Dr. Allen to 3
have a remarkable spiritual rapport with certain souls from the past, and that 3
any correspondent the bearded man might have in Prague would probably be 3
similarly gifted. When they left, Mr. Ward and Dr. Willett realised to their 3
chagrin that they had really been the ones under catechism; and that without 3
imparting anything vital himself, the confined youth had adroitly pumped them 3
of everything the Prague letter had contained. 3
3
Drs. Peck, Waite, and Lyman were not inclined to attach much importance to the 3
strange correspondence of young Ward's companion; for they knew the 3
tendency of kindred eccentrics and monomaniacs to band together, and believed 3
that Charles or Allen had merely unearthed an expatriated counterpart - perhaps 3
one who had seen Orne's handwriting and copied it in an attempt to pose as the 3
bygone character's reincarnation. Allen himself was perhaps a similar case, and 3
may have persuaded the youth into accepting him as an avatar of the long-dead 3
Curwen. Such things had been known before, and on the same basis the hard- 3
headed doctors disposed of Willett's growing disquiet about Charles Ward's 3
present handwriting, as studied from unpremeditated specimens obtained by 3
various ruses. Willett thought he had placed its odd familiarity at last, and that 3
what it vaguely resembled was the bygone penmanship of old Joseph Curwen 3
himself; but this the other physicians regarded as a phase of imitativeness only to 3
be expected in a mania of this sort, and refused to grant it any importance either 3
favourable or unfavourable. Recognising this prosaic attitude in his colleagues, 3
Willett advised Mr. Ward to keep to himself the letter which arrived for Dr. Allen 3
on the second of April from Rakus, Transylvania, in a handwriting so intensely 3
and fundamentally like that of the Hutchinson cipher that both father and 3
physician paused in awe before breaking the seal. This read as follows: 3

3
But if Willett and Mr. Ward refrained from shewing this letter to the alienists, 3
they did not refrain from acting upon it themselves. No amount of learned 3
sophistry could controvert the fact that the strangely bearded and spectacled Dr. 3
Allen, of whom Charles's frantic letter had spoken as such a monstrous menace, 3
was in close and sinister correspondence with two inexplicable creatures whom 3
Ward had visited in his travels and who plainly claimed to be survivals or 3
avatars of Curwen's old Salem colleagues; that he was regarding himself as the 3
reincarnation of Joseph Curwen, and that he entertained - or was at least advised 3
to entertain - murderous designs against a "boy" who could scarcely be other 3
3
3
3
370 3
3
3
3
than Charles Ward. There was organised horror afoot; and no matter who had 3
started it, the missing Allen was by this time at the bottom of it. Therefore, 3
thanking heaven that Charles was now safe in the hospital, Mr. Ward lost no 3
time in engaging detectives to learn all they could of the cryptic, bearded doctor; 3
finding whence he had come and what Pawtuxet knew of him, and if possible 3
discovering his present whereabouts. Supplying the men with one of the 3
bungalow keys which Charles yielded up, he urged them to explore Allen's 3
vacant room which had been identified when the patient's belongings had been 3
packed; obtaining what clues they could from any effects he might have left 3
about. Mr. Ward talked with the detectives in his son's old library, and they felt a 3
marked relief when they left it at last; for there seemed to hover about the place a 3
vague aura of evil. Perhaps it was what they had heard of the infamous old 3
wizard whose picture had once stared from the panelled overmantel, and 3
perhaps it was something different and irrelevant; but in any case they all half 3
sensed an intangible miasma which centred in that carven vestige of an older 3
dwelling and which at times almost rose to the intensity of a material emanation. 3

3
3
3
And now swiftly followed that hideous experience which has left its indelible 3
mark of fear on the soul of Marinus Bicknell Willett, and has added a decade to 3
the visible age of one whose youth was even then far behind. Dr. Willett had 3
conferred at length with Mr. Ward, and had come to an agreement with him on 3
several points which both felt the alienists would ridicule. There was, they 3
conceded, a terrible movement alive in the world, whose direct connexion with a 3
necromancy even older than the Salem witchcraft could not be doubted. That at 3
least two living men - and one other of whom they dared not think - were in 3
absolute possession of minds or personalities which had functioned as early as 3
1690 or before was likewise almost unassailably proved even in the face of all 3
known natural laws. What these horrible creatures - and Charles Ward as well - 3
were doing or trying to do seemed fairly clear from their letters and from every 3
bit of light both old and new which had filtered in upon the case. They were 3
robbing the tombs of all the ages, including those of the world's wisest and 3
greatest men, in the hope of recovering from the bygone ashes some vestige of 3
the consciousness and lore which had once animated and informed them. 3
3
A hideous traffic was going on among these nightmare ghouls, whereby 3
illustrious bones were bartered with the calm calculativeness of schoolboys 3
swapping books; and from what was extorted from this centuried dust there was 3
anticipated a power and a wisdom beyond anything which the cosmos had ever 3
seen concentred in one man or group. They had found unholy ways to keep their 3
3
3
3
371 3
3
3
3
brains alive, either in the same body or different bodies; and had evidently 3
achieved a way of tapping the consciousness of the dead whom they gathered 3
together. There had, it seems, been some truth in chimerical old Borellus when he 3
wrote of preparing from even the most antique remains certain "Essential Saltes" 3
from which the shade of a long-dead living thing might be raised up. There was 3
a formula for evoking such a shade, and another for putting it down; and it had 3
now been so perfected that it could be taught successfully. One must be careful 3
about evocations, for the markers of old graves are not always accurate. 3
3
Willett and Mr. Ward shivered as they passed from conclusion to conclusion. 3
Things - presences or voices of some sort - could be drawn down from unknown 3
places as well as from the grave, and in this process also one must be careful. 3
Joseph Curwen had indubitably evoked many forbidden things, and as for 3
Charles - what might one think of him? What forces "outside the spheres" had 3
reached him from Joseph Curwen's day and turned his mind on forgotten 3
things? He had been led to find certain directions, and he had used them. He had 3
talked with the man of horror in Prague and stayed long with the creature in the 3
mountains of Transylvania. And he must have found the grave of Joseph 3
Curwen at last. That newspaper item and what his mother had heard in the night 3
were too significant to overlook. Then he had summoned something, and it must 3
have come. That mighty voice aloft on Good Friday, and those different tones in 3
the locked attic laboratory. What were they like, with their depth and 3
hoUowness? Was there not here some awful foreshadowing of the dreaded 3
stranger Dr. Allen with his spectral bass? Yes, that was what Mr. Ward had felt 3
with vague horror in his single talk with the man - if man it were - over the 3
telephone! 3
3
What hellish consciousness or voice, what morbid shade or presence, had come 3
to answer Charles Ward's secret rites behind that locked door? Those voices 3
heard in argument - "must have it red for three months" - Good God! Was not 3
that just before the vampirism broke out? The rifling of Ezra Weeden's ancient 3
grave, and the cries later at Pawtuxet - whose mind had planned the vengeance 3
and rediscovered the shunned seat of elder blasphemies? And then the 3
bungalow and the bearded stranger, and the gossip, and the fear. The final 3
madness of Charles neither father nor doctor could attempt to explain, but they 3
did feel sure that the mind of Joseph Curwen had come to earth again and was 3
following its ancient morbidities. Was daemoniac possession in truth a 3
possibility? Allen had something to do with it, and the detectives must find out 3
more about one whose existence menaced the young man's life. In the meantime, 3
since the existence of some vast crypt beneath the bungalow seemed virtually 3
beyond dispute, some effort must be made to find it. Willett and Mr. Ward, 3
conscious of the sceptical attitude of the alienists, resolved during their final 3
conference to undertake a joint secret exploration of unparalleled thoroughness; 3
3
3
3
372 3
3
3
3
and agreed to meet at the bungalow on the following morning with valises and 3
with certain tools and accessories suited to architectural search and underground 3
exploration. 3
3
The morning of April 6th dawned clear, and both explorers were at the 3
bungalow by ten o'clock. Mr. Ward had the key, and an entry and cursory 3
survey were made. From the disordered condition of Dr. Allen's room it was 3
obvious that the detectives had been there before, and the later searchers hoped 3
that they had found some clue which might prove of value. Of course the main 3
business lay in the cellar; so thither they descended without much delay, again 3
making the circuit which each had vainly made before in the presence of the mad 3
young owner. For a time everything seemed baffling, each inch of the earthen 3
floor and stone walls having so solid and innocuous an aspect that the thought of 3
a yearning aperture was scarcely to be entertained. Willett reflected that since the 3
original cellar was dug without knowledge of any catacombs beneath, the 3
beginning of the passage would represent the strictly modern delving of young 3
Ward and his associates, where they had probed for the ancient vaults whose 3
rumour could have reached them by no wholesome means. 3
3
The doctor tried to put himself in Charles's place to see how a delver would be 3
likely to start, but could not gain much inspiration from this method. Then he 3
decided on elimination as a policy, and went carefully over the whole 3
subterranean surface both vertical and horizontal, trying to account for every 3
inch separately. He was soon substantially narrowed down, and at last had 3
nothing left but the small platform before the washtubs, which he tried once 3
before in vain. Now experimenting in every possible way, and exerting a double 3
strength, he finally found that the top did indeed turn and slide horizontally on a 3
corner pivot. Beneath it lay a trim concrete surface with an iron manhole, to 3
which Mr. Ward at once rushed with excited zeal. The cover was not hard to lift, 3
and the father had quite removed it when Willett noticed the queerness of his 3
aspect. He was swaying and nodding dizzily, and in the gust of noxious air 3
which swept up from the black pit beneath the doctor soon recognised ample 3
cause. 3
3
In a moment Dr. Willett had his fainting companion on the floor above and was 3
reviving him with cold water. Mr. Ward responded feebly, but it could be seen 3
that the mephitic blast from the crypt had in some way gravely sickened him. 3
Wishing to take no chances, Willett hastened out to Broad Street for a taxicab and 3
had soon dispatched the sufferer home despite his weak-voiced protests; after 3
which he produced an electric torch, covered his nostrils with a band of sterile 3
gauze, and descended once more to peer into the new-found depths. The foul air 3
had now slightly abated, and Willett was able to send a beam of light down the 3
Stygian hold. For about ten feet, he saw, it was a sheer cylindrical drop with 3
3
3
3
373 3
3
3
3
concrete walls and an iron ladder; after which the hole appeared to strike a flight 3
of old stone steps which must originally have emerged to earth somewhat 3
southwest of the present building. 3
3
3
3
Willett freely admits that for a moment the memory of the old Curwen legends 3
kept him from climbing down alone into that malodorous gulf. He could not 3
help thinking of what Like Fenner had reported on that last monstrous night. 3
Then duty asserted itself and he made the plunge, carrying a great valise for the 3
removal of whatever papers might prove of supreme importance. Slowly, as 3
befitted one of his years, he descended the ladder and reached the slimy steps 3
below. This was ancient masonry, his torch told him; and upon the dripping 3
walls he saw the unwholesome moss of centuries. Down, down, ran the steps; 3
not spirally, but in three abrupt turns; and with such narrowness that two men 3
could have passed only with difficulty. He had counted about thirty when a 3
sound reached him very faintly; and after that he did not feel disposed to count 3
any more. 3
3
It was a godless sound; one of those low-keyed, insidious outrages of Nature 3
which are not meant to be. To call it a dull wail, a doom-dragged whine, or a 3
hopeless howl of chorused anguish and stricken flesh without mind would be to 3
miss its quintessential loathsomeness and soul-sickening overtones. Was it for 3
this that Ward had seemed to listen on that day he was removed? It was the most 3
shocking thing that Willett had ever heard, and it continued from no determinate 3
point as the doctor reached the bottom of the steps and cast his torchlight around 3
on lofty corridor walls surmounted by Cyclopean vaulting and pierced by 3
numberless black archways. The hall in which he stood was perhaps fourteen 3
feet high in the middle of the vaulting and ten or twelve feet broad. Its pavement 3
was of large chipped flagstone, and its walls and roof were of dressed masonry. 3
Its length he could not imagine, for it stretched ahead indefinitely into the 3
blackness. Of the archways, some had doors of the old six-panelled colonial type, 3
whilst others had none. 3
3
Overcoming the dread induced by the smell and the howling, Willett began to 3
explore these archways one by one; finding beyond them rooms with groined 3
stone ceilings, each of medium size and apparently of bizarre used. Most of them 3
had fireplaces, the upper courses of whose chimneys would have formed an 3
interesting study in engineering. Never before or since had he seen such 3
instruments or suggestions of instruments as here loomed up on every hand 3
through the burying dust and cobwebs of a century and a half, in many cases 3
evidently shattered as if by the ancient raiders. For many of the chambers 3
seemed wholly untrodden by modern feet, and must have represented the 3
3
3
3
374 3
3
3
3
earliest and most obsolete phases of Joseph Curwen's experimentation. Finally 3
there came a room of obvious modernity, or at least of recent occupancy. There 3
were oil heaters, bookshelves and tables, chairs and cabinets, and a desk piled 3
high with papers of varying antiquity and contemporaneousness. Candlesticks 3
and oil lamps stood about in several places; and finding a match-safe handy, 3
Willett lighted such as were ready for use. 3
3
In the fuller gleam it appeared that this apartment was nothing less than the 3
latest study or library of Charles Ward. Of the books the doctor had seen many 3
before, and a good part of the furniture had plainly come from the Prospect 3
Street mansion. Here and there was a piece well known to Willett, and the sense 3
of familiarity became so great that he half forgot the noisomness and the wailing, 3
both of which were plainer here than they had been at the foot of the steps. His 3
first duty, as planned long ahead, was to find and seize any papers which might 3
seem of vital importance; especially those portentous documents found by 3
Charles so long ago behind the picture in Olney Court. As he search he perceived 3
how stupendous a task the final unravelling would be; for file on file was stuffed 3
with papers in curious hands and bearing curious designs, so that months or 3
even years might be needed for a thorough deciphering and editing. Once he 3
found three large packets of letters with Prague and Rakus postmarks, and in 3
writing clearly recognisable as Orne's and Hutchinson's; all of which he took 3
with him as part of the bundle to be removed in his valise. 3
3
At last, in a locked mahogany cabinet once gracing the Ward home, Willett 3
found the batch of old Curwen papers; recognising them from the reluctant 3
glimpse Charles had granted him so many years ago. The youth had evidently 3
kept them together very much as they had been when first he found them, since 3
all the titles recalled by the workmen were present except the papers addressed 3
to Orne and Hutchinson, and the cipher with its key. Willett placed the entire lot 3
in his valise and continued his examination of the files. Since young Ward's 3
immediate condition was the greatest matter at stake, the closest searching was 3
done among the most obviously recent matter; and in this abundance of 3
contemporary manuscript one very baffling oddity was noted. The oddity was 3
the slight amount in Charles's normal writing, which indeed included nothing 3
more recent than two months before. On the other hand, there were literally 3
reams of symbols and formulae, historical notes and philosophical comment, in a 3
crabbed penmanship absolutely identical with the ancient script of Joseph 3
Curwen, though of undeniably modern dating. Plainly, a part of the latter-day 3
programme had been a sedulous imitation of the old wizard's writing, which 3
Charles seemed to have carried to a marvellous state of perfection. Of any third 3
hand which might have been Allen's there was not a trace. If he had indeed come 3
to be the leader, he must have forced young Ward to act as his amanuensis. 3
3
3
3
375 3
3
3
3
In this new material one mystic formula, or rather pair of formulae, recurred so 3
often that Willett had it by heart before he had half finished his quest. It 3
consisted of two parallel columns, the left-hand one surmounted by the archaic 3
symbol called "Dragon's Head" and used in almanacs to indicate the ascending 3
node, and the right-hand one headed by a corresponding sign of "Dragon's Tail" 3
or descending node. The appearance of the whole was something like this, and 3
almost unconsciously the doctor realised that the second half was no more than 3
the first written syllabically backward with the exception of the final 3
monosyllables and of the odd name Yog-Sothoth, which he had come to 3
recognise under various spellings from other things he had seen in connexion 3
with this horrible matter. The formulae were as follows - exactly so, as Willett is 3
abundantly able to testify - and the first one struck an odd note of uncomfortable 3
latent memory in his brain, which he recognised later when reviewing the events 3
of that horrible Good Friday of the previous year. 3

3
So haunting were these formulae, and so frequently did he come upon them, that 3
before the doctor knew it he was repeating them under his breath. Eventually, 3
however, he felt he had secured all the papers he could digest to advantage for 3
the present; hence resolved to examine no more till he could bring the sceptical 3
alienists en masse for an ampler and more systematic raid. He had still to find 3
the hidden laboratory, so leaving his valise in the lighted room he emerged again 3
into the black noisome corridor whose vaulting echoed ceaseless with that dull 3
and hideous whine. 3
3
The next few rooms he tried were all abandoned, or filled only with crumbling 3
boxes and ominous-looking leaden coffins; but impressed him deeply with the 3
magnitude of Joseph Curwen's original operations. He thought of the slaves and 3
seamen who had disappeared, of the graves which had been violated in every 3
part of the world, and of what that final raiding party must have seen; and then 3
he decided it was better not to think any more. Once a great stone staircase 3
mounted at his right, and he deduced that this must have reached to one of the 3
3
3
3
376 3
3
3
3
Curwen outbuildings - perhaps the famous stone edifice with the high sht-Hke 3
windows - provided the steps he had descended had led from the steep-roofed 3
farmhouse. Suddenly the walls seemed to fall away ahead, and the stench and 3
the wailing grew stronger. Willett saw that he had come upon a vast open space, 3
so great that his torchlight would not carry across it; and as he advanced he 3
encountered occasional stout pillars supporting the arches of the roof. 3
3
After a time he reached a circle of pillars grouped like the monoliths of 3
Stonehenge, with a large carved altar on a base of three steps in the centre; and 3
so curious were the carvings on that altar that he approached to study them with 3
his electric light. But when he saw what they were he shrank away shuddering, 3
and did not stop to investigate the dark stains which discoloured the upper 3
surface and had spread down the sides in occasional thin lines. Instead, he found 3
the distant wall and traced it as it swept round in a gigantic circle perforated by 3
occasional black doorways and indented by a myriad of shallow cells with iron 3
gratings and wrist and ankle bonds on chains fastened to the stone of the 3
concave rear masonry. These cells were empty, but still the horrible odour and 3
the dismal moaning continued, more insistent now than ever, and seemingly 3
varied at time by a sort of slippery thumping. 3
3
3
3
From that frightful smell and that uncanny noise Willett's attention could no 3
longer be diverted. Both were plainer and more hideous in the great pillared hall 3
than anywhere else, and carried a vague impression of being far below, even in 3
this dark nether world of subterrene mystery. Before trying any of the black 3
archways for steps leading further down, the doctor cast his beam of light about 3
the stone-flagged floor. It was very loosely paved, and at irregular intervals there 3
would occur a slab curiously pierced by small holes in no definite arrangement, 3
while at one point there lay a very long ladder carelessly flung down. To this 3
ladder, singularly enough, appeared to cling a particularly large amount of the 3
frightful odour which encompassed everything. As he walked slowly about it 3
suddenly occurred to Willett that both the noise and the odour seemed strongest 3
above the oddly pierced slabs, as if they might be crude trap-doors leading down 3
to some still deeper region of horror. Kneeling by one, he worked at it with his 3
hands, and found that with extreme difficulty he could budge it. At his touch the 3
moaning beneath ascended to a louder key, and only with vast trepidation did he 3
persevere in the lifting of the heavy stone. A stench unnameable now rose up 3
from below, and the doctor's head reeled dizzily as he laid back the slab and 3
turned his torch upon the exposed square yard of gaping blackness. 3
3
If he had expected a flight of steps to some wide gulf of ultimate abomination, 3
Willett was destined to be disappointed; for amidst that foetor and cracked 3
3
3
3
377 3
3
3
3
whining he discerned only the brick-faced top of a cyhndrical well perhaps a 3
yard and a half in diameter and devoid of any ladder or other means of descent. 3
As the light shone down, the wailing changed suddenly to a series of horrible 3
yelps; in conjunction with which there came again that sound of blind, futile 3
scrambling and slippery thumping. The explorer trembled, unwilling even to 3
imagine what noxious thing might be lurking in that abyss, but in a moment 3
mustered up the courage to peer over the rough-hewn brink; lying at full length 3
and holding the torch downward at arm's length to see what might lie below. 3
For a second he could distinguish nothing but the slimy, moss-grown brick walls 3
sinking illimitably into that half-tangible miasma of murk and foulness and 3
anguished frenzy; and then he saw that something dark was leaping clumsily 3
and frantically up and down at the bottom of the narrow shaft, which must have 3
been from twenty to twenty-five feet below the stone floor where he lay. The 3
torch shook in his hand, but he looked again to see what manner of living 3
creature might be immured there in the darkness of that unnatural well; left 3
starving by young Ward through all the long month since the doctors had taken 3
him away, and clearly only one of a vast number prisoned in the kindred wells 3
whose pierced stone covers so thickly studded the floor of the great vaulted 3
cavern. Whatever the things were, they could not lie down in their cramped 3
spaces; but must have crouched and whined and waited and feebly leaped all 3
those hideous weeks since their master had abandoned them unheeded. 3
3
But Marinus Bicknell Willett was sorry that he looked again; for surgeon and 3
veteran of the dissecting-room though he was, he has not been the same since. It 3
is hard to explain just how a single sight of a tangible object with measurable 3
dimensions could so shake and change a man; and we may only say that there is 3
about certain outlines and entities a power of symbolism and suggestion which 3
acts frightfully on a sensitive thinker's perspective and whispers terrible hints of 3
obscure cosmic relationships and unnameable realities behind the protective 3
illusions of common vision. In that second look Willett saw such an outline or 3
entity, for during the next few instants he was undoubtedly as stark raving mad 3
as any inmate of Dr. Waite's private hospital. He dropped the electric torch from 3
a hand drained of muscular power or nervous coordination, nor heeded the 3
sound of crunching teeth which told of its fate at the bottom of the pit. He 3
screamed and screamed and screamed in a voice whose falsetto panic no 3
acquaintance of his would ever have recognised; and though he could not rise to 3
his feet he crawled and rolled desperately away from the damp pavement where 3
dozens of Tartarean wells poured forth their exhausted whining and yelping to 3
answer his own insane cries. He tore his hands on the rough, loose stones, and 3
many times bruised his head against the frequent pillars, but still he kept on. 3
Then at last he slowly came to himself in the utter blackness and stench, and 3
stopped his ears against the droning wail into which the burst of yelping had 3
subsided. He was drenched with perspiration and without means of producing a 3
3
3
3
378 3
3
3
3
light; stricken and unnerved in the abysmal blackness and horror, and crushed 3
with a memory he never could efface. Beneath him dozens of those things still 3
lived, and from one of those shafts the cover was removed. He knew that what 3
he had seen could never climb up the slippery walls, yet shuddered at the 3
thought that some obscure foot-hold might exist. 3
3
What the thing was, he would never tell. It was like some of the carvings on the 3
hellish altar, but it was alive. Nature had never made it in this form, for it was 3
too palpably unfinished. The deficiencies were of the most surprising sort, and 3
the abnormalities of proportion could not be described. Willett consents only to 3
say that this type of thing must have represented entities which Ward called up 3
from imperfect salts, and which he kept for servile or ritualistic purposes. If it 3
had not had a certain significance, its image would not have been carved on that 3
damnable stone. It was not the worst thing depicted on that stone - but Willett 3
never opened the other pits. At the time, the first connected idea in his mind was 3
an idle paragraph from some of the old Curwen data he had digested long 3
before; a phrase used by Simon or Jedediah Orne in that portentous confiscated 3
letter to the bygone sorcerer: 3
3
'Certainely, there was Noth'g but ye liveliest Awfulness in that which H. rais'd 3
upp from What he cou'd gather onlie a part of.' 3
3
Then, horribly supplementing rather than displacing this image, there came a 3
recollection of those ancient lingering rumours anent the burned, twisted thing 3
found in the fields a week after the Curwen raid. Charles Ward had once told the 3
doctor what old Slocum said of that object; that it was neither thoroughly human, 3
nor wholly allied to any animal which Pawtuxet folk had ever seen or read 3
about. 3
3
These words hummed in the doctor's mind as he rocked to and fro, squatting on 3
the nitrous stone floor. He tried to drive them out, and repeated the Lord's 3
Prayer to himself; eventually trailing off into a mnemonic hodge-podge like the 3
modernistic Waste Land of Mr. T. S. Eliot, and finally reverting to the oft- 3
repeated dual formula he had lately found in Ward's underground library: 'Y'ai 3
'ng'ngah, Yog-Sothoth' and so on till the final underlined Zhro. 3
3
It seemed to soothe him, and he staggered to his feet after a time; lamenting 3
bitterly his fright-lost torch and looking wildly about for any gleam of light in the 3
clutching inkiness of the chilly air. Think he would not; but he strained his eyes 3
in every direction for some faint glint or reflection of the bright illumination he 3
had left in the library. After a while he thought he detected a suspicion of a glow 3
infinitely far away, and toward this he crawled in agonised caution on hands and 3
3
3
3
379 3
3
3
3
knees amidst the stench and howHng, always feeHng ahead lest he collide with 3
the numerous great pillars or stumble into the abominable pit he had uncovered. 3
3
Once his shaking fingers touched something which he knew must be the steps 3
leading to the hellish altar, and from this spot he recoiled in loathing. At another 3
time he encountered the pierced slab he had removed, and here his caution 3
became almost pitiful. But he did not come upon the dread aperture after all, nor 3
did anything issue from that aperture to detain him. What had been down there 3
made no sound nor stir. Evidently its crunching of the fallen electric torch had 3
not been good for it. Each time Willett's fingers felt a perforated slab he 3
trembled. His passage over it would sometimes increase the groaning below, but 3
generally it would produce no effect at all, since he moved very noiselessly. 3
Several times during his progress the glow ahead diminished perceptibly, and he 3
realised that the various candles and lamps he had left must be expiring one by 3
one. The thought of being lost in utter darkness without matches amidst this 3
underground world of nightmare labyrinths impelled him to rise to his feet and 3
run, which he could safely do now that he had passed the open pit; for he knew 3
that once the light failed, his only hope of rescue and survival would lie in 3
whatever relief party Mr. Ward might send after missing him for a sufficient 3
period. Presently, however, he emerged from the open space into the narrower 3
corridor and definitely located the glow as coming from a door on his right. In a 3
moment he had reached it and was standing once more in young Ward's secret 3
library, trembling with relief, and watching the sputterings of that last lamp 3
which had brought him to safety. 3
3
3
3
In another moment he was hastily filling the burned-out lamps from an oil 3
supply he had previously noticed, and when the room was bright again he 3
looked about to see if he might find a lantern for further exploration. For racked 3
though he was with horror, his sense of grim purpose was still uppermost; and 3
he was firmly determined to leave no stone unturned in his search for the 3
hideous facts behind Charles Ward's bizarre madness. Failing to find a lantern, 3
he chose the smallest of the lamps to carry; also filling his pockets with candles 3
and matches, and taking with him a gallon can of oil, which he proposed to keep 3
for reserve use in whatever hidden laboratory he might uncover beyond the 3
terrible open space with its unclean altar and nameless covered wells. To traverse 3
that space again would require his utmost fortitude, but he knew it must be 3
done. Fortunately neither the frightful altar nor the opened shaft was near the 3
vast cell-indented wall which bounded the cavern area, and whose black 3
mysterious archways would form the next goals of a logical search. 3
3
3
3
380 3
3
3
3
So Willett went back to that great pillared hall of stench and anguished howling; 3
turning down his lamp to avoid any distant glimpse of the hellish altar, or of the 3
uncovered pit with the pierced stone slab beside it. Most of the black doorways 3
led merely to small chambers, some vacant and some evidently used as 3
storerooms; and in several of the latter he saw some very curious accumulations 3
of various objects. One was packed with rotting and dust-draped bales of spare 3
clothing, and the explorer thrilled when he saw that it was unmistakably the 3
clothing of a century and a half before. In another room he found numerous odds 3
and ends of modern clothing, as if gradual provisions were being made to equip 3
a large body of men. But what he disliked most of all were the huge copper vats 3
which occasionally appeared; these, and the sinister incrustations upon them. He 3
liked them even less than the weirdly figured leaden bowls whose rims retained 3
such obnoxious deposits and around which clung repellent odours perceptible 3
above even the general noisomness of the crypt. When he had completed about 3
half the entire circuit of the wall he found another corridor like that from which 3
he had come, and out of which many doors opened. This he proceeded to 3
investigate; and after entering three rooms of medium size and of no significant 3
contents, he came at last to a large oblong apartment whose business-like tanks 3
and tables, furnaces and modern instruments, occasional books and endless 3
shelves of jars and bottles proclaimed it indeed the long-sought laboratory of 3
Charles Ward - and no doubt of old Joseph Curwen before him. 3
3
After lighting the three lamps which he found filled and ready. Dr. Willett 3
examined the place and all the appurtenances with the keenest interest; noting 3
from the relative quantities of various reagents on the shelves that young Ward's 3
dominant concern must have been with some branch of organic chemistry. On 3
the whole, little could be learned from the scientific ensemble, which included a 3
gruesome-looking dissecting-table; so that the room was really rather a 3
disappointment. Among the books was a tattered old copy of Borellus in black- 3
letter, and it was weirdly interesting to note that Ward had underlined the same 3
passage whose marking had so perturbed good Mr. Merritt in Curwen's 3
farmhouse more than a century and half before. That old copy, of course, must 3
have perished along with the rest of Curwen's occult library in the final raid. 3
Three archways opened off the laboratory, and these the doctor proceeded to 3
sample in turn. From his cursory survey he saw that two led merely to small 3
storerooms; but these he canvassed with care, remarking the piles of coffins in 3
various stages of damage and shuddering violently at two or three of the few 3
coffin-plates he could decipher. There was much clothing also stored in these 3
rooms, and several new and tightly nailed boxes which he did not stop to 3
investigate. Most interesting of all, perhaps, were some odd bits which he judged 3
to be fragments of old Joseph Curwen's laboratory appliances. These had 3
suffered damage at the hands of the raiders, but were still partly recognisable as 3
the chemical paraphernalia of the Georgian period. 3
3
3
3
381 3
3
3
3
The third archway led to a very sizeable chamber entirely lined with shelves and 3
having in the centre a table bearing two lamps. These lamps Willett lighted, and 3
in their brilliant glow studied the endless shelving which surrounded him. Some 3
of the upper levels were wholly vacant, but most of the space was filled with 3
small odd-looking leaden jars of two general types; one tall and without handles 3
like a Grecian lekythos or oil-jug, and the other with a single handle and 3
proportioned like a Phaleron jug. All had metal stoppers, and were covered with 3
peculiar-looking symbols moulded in low relief. In a moment the doctor noticed 3
that these jugs were classified with great rigidity; all the lekythoi being on one 3
side of the room with a large wooden sign reading 'Custodes' above them, and 3
all the Phalerons on the other, correspondingly labelled with a sign reading 3
'Materia'. 3
3
Each of the jars of jugs, except some on the upper shelves that turned out to be 3
vacant, bore a cardboard tag with a number apparently referring to a catalogue; 3
and Willett resolved to look for the latter presently. For the moment, however, he 3
was more interested in the nature of the array as a whole, and experimentally 3
opened several of the lekythoi and Phalerons at random with a view to a rough 3
generalisation. The result was invariable. Both types of jar contained a small 3
quantity of a single kind of substance; a fine dusty powder of very light weight 3
and of many shades of dull, neutral colour. To the colours which formed the only 3
point of variation there was no apparent method of disposal; and no distinction 3
between what occurred in the lekythoi and what occurred in the Phalerons. A 3
bluish-grey powder might be by the side of a pinkish-white one, and any one in a 3
Phaleron might have its exact counterpart in a lekythos. The most individual 3
feature about the powders was their non-adhesiveness. Willett would pour one 3
into his hand, and upon returning it to its jug would find that no residue 3
whatever remained on his palm. 3
3
The meaning of the two signs puzzled him, and he wondered why this battery of 3
chemicals was separated so radically from those in glass jars on the shelves of the 3
laboratory proper. "Custodes", "Materia"; that was the Latin for "Guards" and 3
"Materials", respectively - and then there came a flash of memory as to where he 3
had seen that word "Guards" before in connexion with this dreadful mystery. It 3
was, of course, in the recent letter to Dr. Allen purporting to be from old Edwin 3
Hutchinson; and the phrase had read: 'There was no Neede to keep the Guards 3
in Shape and eat'g off their Heads, and it made Much to be founde in Case of 3
Trouble, as you too welle knowe.' What did this signify? But wait - was there not 3
still another reference to "guards" in this matter which he had failed wholly to 3
recall when reading the Hutchinson letter? Back in the old non-secretive days 3
Ward had told him of the Eleazar Smith diary recording the spying of Smith and 3
Weeden on the Curwen farm, and in that dreadful chronicle there had been a 3
mention of conversations overheard before the old wizard betook himself wholly 3
3
3
3
382 3
3
3
3
beneath the earth. There had been. Smith and Weeden insisted, terrible 3
colloquies wherein figured Curwen, certain captives of his, and the guards of 3
those captives. Those guards, according to Hutchinson or his avatar, had "eaten 3
their heads off", so that now Dr. Allen did not keep them in shape. And if not in 3
shape, how save as the "salts" to which it appears this wizard band was engaged 3
in reducing as many human bodies or skeletons as they could? 3
3
So that was what these lekythoi contained; the monstrous fruit of unhallowed 3
rites and deeds, presumably won or cowed to such submission as to help, when 3
called up by some hellish incantation, in the defence of their blasphemous master 3
or the questioning of those who were not so willing? Willett shuddered at the 3
thought of what he had been pouring in and out of his hands, and for a moment 3
felt an impulse to flee in panic from that cavern of hideous shelves with their 3
silent and perhaps watching sentinels. Then he thought of the "Materia" - in the 3
myriad Phaleron jugs on the other side of the room. Salts too - and if not the salts 3
of "guards", then the salts of what? God! Could it be possible that here lay the 3
mortal relics of half the titan thinkers of all the ages; snatched by supreme ghouls 3
from crypts where the world thought them safe, and subject to the beck and call 3
of madmen who sought to drain their knowledge for some still wilder end whose 3
ultimate effect would concern, as poor Charles had hinted in his frantic note, "all 3
civilisation, all natural law, perhaps even the fate of the solar system and the 3
universe"? And Marinus Bicknell Willett had sifted their dust through his hands! 3
3
Then he noticed a small door at the further end of the room, and calmed himself 3
enough to approach it and examine the crude sign chiselled above. It was only a 3
symbol, but it filled him with vague spiritual dread; for a morbid, dreaming 3
friend of his had once drawn it on paper and told him a few of the things it 3
means in the dark abyss of sleep. It was the sign of Koth, that dreamers see fixed 3
above the archway of a certain black tower standing alone in twilight - and 3
Willett did not like what his friend Randolph Carter had said of its powers. But a 3
moment later he forgot the sign as he recognised a new acrid odour in the 3
stench-filled air. This was a chemical rather than animal smell, and came clearly 3
from the room beyond the door. And it was, unmistakably, the same odour 3
which had saturated Charles Ward's clothing on the day the doctors had taken 3
him away. So it was here that the youth had been interrupted by the final 3
summons? He was wiser that old Joseph Curwen, for he had not resisted. Willett, 3
boldly determined to penetrate every wonder and nightmare this nether realm 3
might contain, seized the small lamp and crossed the threshold. A wave of 3
nameless fright rolled out to meet him, but he yielded to no whim and deferred 3
to no intuition. There was nothing alive here to harm him, and he would not be 3
stayed in his piercing of the eldritch cloud which engulfed his patient. 3
3
3
3
383 3
3
3
3
The room beyond the door was of medium size, and had no furniture save a 3
table, a single chair, and two groups of curious machines with clamps and 3
wheels, which Willett recognised after a moment as mediaeval instruments of 3
torture. On one side of the door stood a rack of savage whips, above which were 3
some shelves bearing empty rows of shallow pedestalled cups of lead shaped 3
like Grecian kylikes. On the other side was the table; with a powerful Argand 3
lamp, a pad and pencil, and two of the stoppered lekythoi from the shelves 3
outside set down at irregular places as if temporarily or in haste. Willett lighted 3
the lamp and looked carefully at the pad, to see what notes Ward might have 3
been jotting down when interrupted; but found nothing more intelligible than 3
the following disjointed fragments in that crabbed Curwen chirography, which 3
shed no light on the case as a whole: 3
3
'B. dy'd not. Escap'd into walls and founde Place below.' 3
'Sawe olde V. saye ye Sabaoth and learnt yee Way.' 3
'Rais'd Yog-Sothoth thrice and was ye nexte Day deliver'd.' 3
'F. soughte to wipe out all know'g howe to raise Those from Outside.' 3
3
As the strong Argand blaze lit up the entire chamber the doctor saw that the wall 3
opposite the door, between the two groups of torturing appliances in the corners, 3
was covered with pegs from which hung a set of shapeless-looking robes of a 3
rather dismal yellowish-white. But far more interesting were the two vacant 3
walls, both of which were thickly covered with mystic symbols and formulae 3
roughly chiselled in the smooth dressed stone. The damp floor also bore marks 3
of carving; and with but little difficulty Willett deciphered a huge pentagram in 3
the centre, with a plain circle about three feet wide half way between this and 3
each corner. In one of these four circles, near where a yellowish robe had been 3
flung carelessly down, there stood a shallow kylix of the sort found on the 3
shelves above the whip-rack; and just outside the periphery was one of the 3
Phaleron jugs from the shelves in the other room, its tag numbered 118. This was 3
unstoppered, and proved upon inspection to be empty; but the explorer saw 3
with a shiver that the kylix was not. Within its shallow area, and saved from 3
scattering only by the absence of wind in this sequestered cavern, lay a small 3
amount of a dry, dull-greenish efflorescent powder which must have belonged in 3
the jug; and Willett almost reeled at the implications that came sweeping over 3
him as he correlated little by little the several elements and antecedents of the 3
scene. The whips and the instruments of torture, the dust or salts from the jug of 3
"Materia", the two lekythoi from the "Custodes" shelf, the robes, the formulae 3
on the walls, the notes on the pad, the hints from letters and legends, and the 3
thousand glimpses, doubts, and suppositions which had come to torment the 3
friends and parents of Charles Ward - all these engulfed the doctor in a tidal 3
wave of horror as he looked at that dry greenish powder outspread in the 3
pedestalled leaden kylix on the floor. 3
3
3
3
384 3
3
3
3
With an effort, however, Willett pulled himself together and began studying the 3
formulae chiselled on the walls. From the stained and incrusted letters it was 3
obvious that they were carved in Joseph Curwen's time, and their text was such 3
as to be vaguely familiar to one who had read much Curwen material or delved 3
extensively into the history of magic. One the doctor clearly recognised as what 3
Mrs. Ward heard her son chanting on that ominous Good Friday a year before, 3
and what an authority had told him was a very terrible invocation addressed to 3
secret gods outside the normal spheres. It was not spelled here exactly as Mrs. 3
Ward had set it down from memory, nor yet as the authority had shewn it to him 3
in the forbidden pages of "Eliphas Levi"; but its identity was unmistakable, and 3
such words as Sabaoth, Metraton, Almonsin, and Zariatnatmik sent a shudder of 3
fright through the search who had seen and felt so much of cosmic abomination 3
just around the corner. 3
3
This was on the left-hand wall as one entered the room. The right-hand wall was 3
no less thickly inscribed, and Willett felt a start of recognition when he came up 3
the pair of formulae so frequently occurring in the recent notes in the library. 3
They were, roughly speaking, the same; with the ancient symbols of "Dragon's 3
Head" and "Dragon's Tail" heading them as in Ward's scribblings. But the 3
spelling differed quite widely from that of the modern versions, as if old Curwen 3
had had a different way of recording sound, or as if later study had evolved 3
more powerful and perfected variants of the invocations in question. The doctor 3
tried to reconcile the chiselled version with the one which still ran persistently in 3
his head, and found it hard to do. Where the script he had memorised began 3
"Y'ai 'ng'ngah, Yog-Sothoth", this epigraph started out as "Aye, engengah, 3
Yogge-Sothotha"; which to his mind would seriously interfere with the 3
syllabification of the second word. 3
3
Ground as the later text was into his consciousness, the discrepancy disturbed 3
him; and he found himself chanting the first of the formulae aloud in an effort to 3
square the sound he conceived with the letters he found carved. Weird and 3
menacing in that abyss of antique blasphemy rang his voice; its accents keyed to 3
a droning sing-song either through the spell of the past and the unknown, or 3
through the hellish example of that dull, godless wail from the pits whose 3
inhuman cadences rose and fell rhythmically in the distance through the stench 3
and the darkness. 3
3
Y'AI 'NG'NGAH, 3
3
YOG-SOTHOTH 3
3
H'EE-L'GEB 3
3
F'AI THRODOG 3
3
UAAAH! 3
3
3
3
385 3
3
3
3
But what was this cold wind which had sprung into hfe at the very outset of the 3
chant? The lamps were sputtering woefully, and the gloom grew so dense that 3
the letters on the wall nearly faded from sight. There was smoke, too, and an 3
acrid odour which quite drowned out the stench from the far-away wells; an 3
odour like that he had smelt before, yet infinitely stronger and more pungent. He 3
turned from the inscriptions to face the room with its bizarre contents, and saw 3
that the kylix on the floor, in which the ominous efflorescent powder had lain, 3
was giving forth a cloud of thick, greenish-black vapour of surprising volume 3
and opacity. That powder - Great God! it had come from the shelf of "Materia" - 3
what was it doing now, and what had started it? The formula he had been 3
chanting - the first of the pair - Dragon's Head, ascending node - Blessed Saviour, 3
could it be ... 3
3
The doctor reeled, and through his head raced wildly disjointed scraps from all 3
he had seen, heard, and read of the frightful case of Joseph Curwen and Charles 3
Dexter Ward. "I say to you againe, doe not call up Any that you can not put 3
downe . . . Have ye Wordes for laying at all times readie, and stopp not to be sure 3
when there is any Doubte of Whom you have ... 3 Talkes with What was therein 3
inhum'd ..." Mercy of Heaven, what is that shape behind the parting smoke? 3
3
3
3
Marinus Bicknell Willett has not hope that any part of his tale will be believed 3
except by certain sympathetic friends, hence he has made no attempt to tell it 3
beyond his most intimate circle. Only a few outsiders have ever heard it 3
repeated, and of these the majority laugh and remark that the doctor surely is 3
getting old. He has been advised to take a long vacation and to shun future cases 3
dealing with mental disturbance. But Mr. Ward knows that the veteran physician 3
speaks only a horrible truth. Did not he himself see the noisome aperture in the 3
bungalow cellar? Did not Willett send him home overcome and ill at eleven 3
o'clock that portentous morning? Did he not telephone the doctor in vain that 3
evening, and again the next day, and had he not driven to the bungalow itself on 3
that following noon, finding his friend unconscious but unharmed on one of the 3
beds upstairs? Willett had been breathing stertorously, and opened his eyes 3
slowly when Mr. Ward gave him some brandy fetched from the car. Then he 3
shuddered and screamed, crying out, 'That beard... those eyes... God, who are 3
you?' A very strange thing to say to a trim, blue-eyed, clean-shaven gentleman 3
whom he had known from the latter's boyhood. 3
3
In the bright noon sunlight the bungalow was unchanged since the previous 3
morning. Willett's clothing bore no disarrangement beyond certain smudges and 3
worn places at the knees, and only a faint acrid odour reminded Mr. Ward of 3
what he had smelt on his son that day he was taken to the hospital. The doctor's 3
3
3
3
386 3
3
3
3
flashlight was missing, but his valise was safely there, as empty as when he had 3
brought it. Before indulging in any explanations, and obviously with great moral 3
effort, Willett staggered dizzily down to the cellar and tried the fateful platform 3
before the tubs. It was unyielding. Crossing to where he had left his yet unused 3
tool satchel the day before, he obtained a chisel and began to pry up the stubborn 3
planks one by one. Underneath the smooth concrete was still visible, but of any 3
opening or perforation there was no longer a trace. Nothing yawned this time to 3
sicken the mystified father who had followed the doctor downstairs; only the 3
smooth concrete underneath the planks - no noisome well, no world of 3
subterrene horrors, no secret library, no Curwen papers, no nightmare pits of 3
stench and howling, no laboratory or shelves or chiselled formulae, no... Dr. 3
Willett turned pale, and clutched at the younger man. 'Yesterday,' he asked 3
softly, 'did you see it here ... and smell it?' And when Mr. Ward, himself 3
transfixed with dread and wonder, found strength to nod an affirmative, the 3
physician gave a sound half a sigh and half a gasp, and nodded in turn. 'Then I 3
will tell you', he said. 3
3
So for an hour, in the sunniest room they could find upstairs, the physician 3
whispered his frightful tale to the wondering father. There was nothing to relate 3
beyond the looming up of that form when the greenish-black vapour from the 3
kylix parted, and Willett was too tired to ask himself what had really occurred. 3
There were futile, bewildered head-shakings from both men, and once Mr. Ward 3
ventured a hushed suggestion, 'Do you suppose it would be of any use to dig?' 3
The doctor was silent, for it seemed hardly fitting for any human brain to answer 3
when powers of unknown spheres had so vitally encroached on this side of the 3
Great Abyss. Again Mr. Ward asked, 'But where did it go? It brought you here, 3
you know, and it sealed up the hole somehow.' And Willett again let silence 3
answer for him. 3
3
But after all, this was not the final phase of the matter. Reaching for his 3
handkerchief before rising to leave. Dr. Willett's fingers closed upon a piece of 3
paper in his pocket which had not been there before, and which was 3
companioned by the candles and matches he had seized in the vanished vault. It 3
was a common sheet, torn obviously from the cheap pad in that fabulous room of 3
horror somewhere underground, and the writing upon it was that of an ordinary 3
lead pencil - doubtless the one which had lain beside the pad. It was folded very 3
carelessly, and beyond the faint acrid scent of the cryptic chamber bore no print 3
or mark of any world but this. But in the text itself it did indeed reek with 3
wonder; for here was no script of any wholesome age, but the laboured strokes 3
of mediaeval darkness, scarcely legible to the laymen who now strained over it, 3
yet having combinations of symbols which seemed vaguely familiar. The briefly 3
scrawled message was this, and its mystery lent purpose to the shaken pair, who 3
3
3
3
387 3
3
3
3
forthwith walked steadily out to the Ward car and gave orders to be driven first 3
to a quiet dining place and then to the John Hay Library on the hill. 3
3
At the library it was easy to find good manuals of palaeography, and over these 3
the two men puzzled till the lights of evening shone out from the great 3
chandelier. In the end they found what was needed. The letters were indeed no 3
fantastic invention, but the normal script of a very dark period. They were the 3
pointed Saxon minuscules of the eighth or ninth century A.D., and brought with 3
them memories of an uncouth time when under a fresh Christian veneer ancient 3
faiths and ancient rites stirred stealthily, and the pale moon of Britain looked 3
sometimes on strange deeds in the Roman ruins of Caerleon and Hexham, and 3
by the towers along Hadrian's crumbling wall. The words were in such Latin as a 3
barbarous age might remember - 'Corvinus necandus est. Cadaver aq(ua) forti 3
dissolvendum, nee aliq(ui)d retinendum. Tace ut potes.' - which may roughly be 3
translated, "Curwen must be killed. The body must be dissolved in aqua fortis, 3
nor must anything be retained. Keep silence as best you are able." 3
3
Willett and Mr. Ward were mute and baffled. They had met the unknown, and 3
found that they lacked emotions to respond to it as they vaguely believed they 3
ought. With Willett, especially, the capacity for receiving fresh impressions of 3
awe was well-nigh exhausted; and both men sat still and helpless till the closing 3
of the library forced them to leave. Then they drove listlessly to the Ward 3
mansion in Prospect Street, and talked to no purpose into the night. The doctor 3
rested toward morning, but did not go home. And he was still there Sunday 3
noon when a telephone message came from the detectives who had been 3
assigned to look up Dr. Allen. 3
3
Mr. Ward, who was pacing nervously about in a dressing-gown, answered the 3
call in person; and told the men to come up early the next day when he heard 3
their report was almost ready. Both Willett and he were glad that this phase of 3
the matter was taking form, for whatever the origin of the strange minuscule 3
message, it seemed certain the "Curwen" who must be destroyed could be no 3
other than the bearded and spectacled stranger. Charles had feared this man, and 3
had said in the frantic note that he must be killed and dissolved in acid. Allen, 3
moreover, had been receiving letters from the strange wizards in Europe under 3
the name of Curwen, and palpably regarded himself as an avatar of the bygone 3
necromancer. And now from a fresh and unknown source had come a message 3
saying that "Curwen" must be killed and dissolved in acid. The linkage was too 3
unmistakable to be factitious; and besides, was not Allen planning to murder 3
young Ward upon the advice of the creature called Hutchinson? Of course, the 3
letter they had seen had never reached the bearded stranger; but from its text 3
they could see that Allen had already formed plans for dealing with the youth if 3
he grew too "squeamish". Without doubt, Allen must be apprehended; and even 3
3
3
3
388 3
3
3
3
if the most drastic directions were not carried out, he must be placed where he 3
could inflict no harm upon Charles Ward. 3
3
That afternoon, hoping against hope to extract some gleam of information anent 3
the inmost mysteries from the only available one capable of giving it, the father 3
and the doctor went down the bay and called on young Charles at the hospital. 3
Simply and gravely Willett told him all he had found, and noticed how pale he 3
turned as each description made certain the truth of the discovery. The physician 3
employed as much dramatic effect as he could, and watched for a wincing on 3
Charles's part when he approached the matter of the covered pits and the 3
nameless hybrids within. But Ward did not wince. Willett paused, and his voice 3
grew indignant as he spoke of how the things were starving. He taxed the youth 3
with shocking inhumanity, and shivered when only a sardonic laugh came in 3
reply. For Charles, having dropped as useless his pretence that the crypt did not 3
exist, seemed to see some ghastly jest in this affair; and chucked hoarsely at 3
something which amused him. Then he whispered, in accents doubly terrible 3
because of the cracked voice he used, 'Damn 'em, they do eat, but they don't 3
need to! That's the rare part! A month, you say, without food? Lud, Sir, you be 3
modest! D'ye know, that was the joke on poor old Whipple with his virtuous 3
bluster! Kill everything off, would he? Why, damme, he was half-deaf with noise 3
from Outside and never saw or heard aught from the wells! He never dreamed 3
they were there at all! Devil take ye, those cursed things have been howling 3
down there ever since Curwen was done for a hundred and fifty-seven years 3
gone!' 3
3
But no more than this could Willett get from the youth. Horrified, yet almost 3
convinced against his will, he went on with his tale in the hope that some 3
incident might startle his auditor out of the mad composure he maintained. 3
Looking at the youth's face, the doctor could not but feel a kind of terror at the 3
changes which recent months had wrought. Truly, the boy had drawn down 3
nameless horrors from the skies. When the room with the formulae and the 3
greenish dust was mentioned, Charles shewed his first sign of animation. A 3
quizzical look overspread his face as he heard what Willett had read on the pad, 3
and he ventured the mild statement that those notes were old ones, of no 3
possible significance to anyone not deeply initiated in the history of magic. But, 3
he added, 'had you but known the words to bring up that which I had out in the 3
cup, you had not been here to tell me this. 'Twas Number 118, and I conceive you 3
would have shook had you looked it up in my list in t'other room. 'Twas never 3
raised by me, but I meant to have it up that day you came to invite me hither.' 3
3
Then Willett told of the formula he had spoken and of the greenish-black smoke 3
which had arisen; and as he did so he saw true fear dawn for the first time on 3
Charles Ward's face. 'It came, and you be here alive?' As Ward croaked the 3
3
3
3
389 3
3
3
3
words his voice seemed almost to burst free of its trammels and sink to 3
cavernous abysses of uncanny resonance. Willett, gifted with a flash of 3
inspiration, believed he saw the situation, and wove into his reply a caution from 3
a letter he remembered. 'No. 118, you say? But don't forget that stones are all 3
changed now in nine grounds out of ten. You are never sure till you question!' 3
And then, without warning, he drew forth the minuscule message and flashed it 3
before the patient's eyes. He could have wished no stronger result, for Charles 3
Ward fainted forthwith. 3
3
All this conversation, of course, had been conducted with the greatest secrecy 3
lest the resident alienists accuse the father and the physician of encouraging a 3
madman in his delusions. Unaided, too. Dr. Willett and Mr. Ward picked up the 3
stricken youth and placed him on the couch. In reviving, the patient mumbled 3
many times of some word which he must get to Orne and Hutchinson at once; so 3
when his consciousness seemed fully back the doctor told him that of those 3
strange creatures at least one was his bitter enemy, and had given Dr. Allen 3
advice for his assassination. This revelation produced no visible effect, and 3
before it was made the visitors could see that their host had already the look of a 3
hunted man. After that he would converse no more, so Willett and the father 3
departed presently; leaving behind a caution against the bearded Allen, to which 3
the youth only replied that this individual was very safely taken care of, and 3
could do no one any harm even if he wished. This was said with an almost evil 3
chuckle very painful to hear. They did not worry about any communications 3
Charles might indite to that monstrous pair in Europe, since they knew that the 3
hospital authorities seized all outgoing mail for censorship and would pass no 3
wild or outre-looking missive. 3
3
There is, however, a curious sequel to the matter of Orne and Hutchinson, if such 3
indeed the exiled wizards were. Moved by some vague presentiment amidst the 3
horrors of that period, Willett arranged with an international press-cutting 3
bureau for accounts of notable current crimes and accidents in Prague and in 3
eastern Transylvania; and after six months believed that he had found two very 3
significant things amongst the multifarious items he received and had translated. 3
One was the total wrecking of a house by night in the oldest quarter of Prague, 3
and the disappearance of the evil old man called Josef Nadek, who had dwelt in 3
it alone ever since anyone could remember. The other was a titan explosion in 3
the Transylvanian mountains east of Rakus, and the utter extirpation with all its 3
inmates of the ill-regarded Castle Ferenczy, whose master was so badly spoken 3
of by peasants and soldiery alike that he would shortly have been summoned to 3
Bucharest for serious questioning had not this incident cut off a career already so 3
long as to antedate all common memory. Willett maintains that the hand which 3
wrote those minuscules was able to wield stronger weapons as well; and that 3
while Curwen was left to him to dispose of, the writer felt able to find and deal 3
3

with Orne and Hutchinson itself. If what their fate may have been the doctor 3
strives sedulously not to think. 3
3
3
3
The following morning Dr. Willett hastened to the Ward home to be present 3
when the detectives arrived. Allen's destruction or imprisonment - or Curwen's 3
if one might regard the tacit claim to reincarnation as valid - he felt must be 3
accomplished at any cost, and he communicated this conviction to Mr. Ward as 3
they sat waiting for the men to come. They were downstairs this time, for the 3
upper parts of the house were beginning to be shunned because of a particular 3
nauseousness which hung indefinitely about; a nauseousness which the older 3
servants connected with some curse left by the vanished Curwen portrait. 3
3
At nine o'clock the three detectives presented themselves and immediately 3
delivered all that they had to say. They had not, regrettably enough, located the 3
Brava Tony Gomes as they had wished, nor had they found the least trace of Dr. 3
Allen's source or present whereabouts; but they had managed to unearth a 3
considerable number of local impressions and facts concerning the reticent 3
stranger. Allen had struck Pawtuxet people as a vaguely unnatural being, and 3
there was a universal belief that his thick sandy beard was either dyed or false - a 3
belief conclusively upheld by the finding of such a false beard, together with a 3
pair of dark glasses, in his room at the fateful bungalow. His voice, Mr. Ward 3
could well testify from his one telephone conversation, had a depth and 3
hoUowness that could not be forgotten; and his glanced seemed malign even 3
through his smoked and horn-rimmed glasses. One shopkeeper, in the course of 3
negotiations, had seen a specimen of his handwriting and declared it was very 3
queer and crabbed; this being confirmed by pencilled notes of no clear meaning 3
found in his room and identified by the merchant. In connexion with the 3
vampirism rumours of the preceding summer, a majority of the gossips believed 3
that Allen rather than Ward was the actual vampire. Statements were also 3
obtained from the officials who had visited the bungalow after the unpleasant 3
incident of the motor truck robbery. They had felt less of the sinister in Dr. Allen, 3
but had recognised him as the dominant figure in the queer shadowy cottage. 3
The place had been too dark for them to observe him clearly, but they would 3
know him again if they saw him. His beard had looked odd, and they thought he 3
had some slight scar above his dark spectacled right eye. As for the detectives' 3
search of Allen's room, it yielded nothing definite save the beard and glasses, 3
and several pencilled notes in a crabbed writing which Willett at once saw was 3
identical with that shared by the old Curwen manuscripts and by the 3
voluminous recent notes of young Ward found in the vanished catacombs of 3
horror. 3
3

3
3
Dr. Willett and Mr. Ward caught something of a profound, subtle, and insidious 3
cosmic fear from this data as it was gradually unfolded, and almost trembled in 3
following up the vague, mad thought which had simultaneously reached their 3
minds. The false beard and glasses - the crabbed Curwen penmanship - the old 3
portrait and its tiny scar - and the altered youth in the hospital with such a scar - 3
that deep, hollow voice on the telephone - was it not of this that Mr. Ward was 3
reminded when his son barked forth those pitiable tones to which he now 3
claimed to be reduced? Who had ever seen Charles and Allen together? Yes, the 3
officials had once, but who later on? Was it not when Allen left that Charles 3
suddenly lost his growing fright and began to live wholly at the bungalow? 3
Curwen - Allen - Ward - in what blasphemous and abominable fusion had two 3
ages and two persons become involved? That damnable resemblance of the 3
picture to Charles - had it not used to stare and stare, and follow the boy around 3
the room with its eyes? Why, too, did both Allen and Charles copy Joseph 3
Curwen's handwriting, even when alone and off guard? And then the frightful 3
work of those people - the lost crypt of horrors that had aged the doctor 3
overnight; the starving monsters in the noisome pits; the awful formula which 3
had yielded such nameless results; the message in minuscules found in Willett's 3
pocket; the papers and the letters and all the talk of graves and "salts" and 3
discoveries - whither did everything lead? In the end Mr. Ward did the most 3
sensible thing. Steeling himself against any realisation of why he did it, he gave 3
the detectives an article to be shewn to such Pawtuxet shopkeepers as had seen 3
the portentous Dr. Allen. That article was a photograph of his luckless son, on 3
which he now carefully drew in ink the pair of heavy glasses and the black 3
pointed beard which the men had brought from Allen's room. 3
3
For two hours he waited with the doctor in the oppressive house where fear and 3
miasma were slowly gathering as the empty panel in the upstairs library leered 3
and leered and leered. Then the men returned. Yes. The altered photograph was 3
a very passable likeness of Dr. Allen. Mr. Ward turned pale, and Willett wiped a 3
suddenly dampened brow with his handkerchief. Allen - Ward - Curwen - it was 3
becoming too hideous for coherent thought. What had the boy called out of the 3
void, and what had it done to him? What, really, had happened from first to last? 3
Who was this Allen who sought to kill Charles as too "squeamish", and why had 3
his destined victim said in the postscript to that frantic letter that he must be so 3
completely obliterated in acid? Why, too, had the minuscule message, of whose 3
origin no one dared think, said that "Curwen" must be likewise obliterated? 3
What was the change, and when had the final stage occurred? That day when his 3
frantic note was received - he had been nervous all the morning, then there was 3
an alteration. He had slipped out unseen and swaggered boldly in past the men 3
hired to guard him. That was the time, when he was out. But no - had he not 3
cried out in terror as he entered his study - this very room? What had he found 3
there? Or wait - what had found him? That simulacrum which brushed boldly in 3
3
3
3
392 3
3
3
3
without having been seen to go - was that an ahen shadow and a horror forcing 3
itself upon a trembhng figure which had never gone out at all? Had not the 3
butler spoken of queer noises? 3
3
Willett rang for the man and asked him some low -toned questions. It had, surely 3
enough, been a bad business. There had been noises - a cry, a gasp, a choking, 3
and a sort of clattering or creaking or thumping, or all of these. And Mr. Charles 3
was not the same when he stalked out without a word. The butler shivered as he 3
spoke, and sniffed at the heavy air that blew down from some open window 3
upstairs. Terror had settled definitely upon the house, and only the business-like 3
detectives failed to imbibe a full measure of it. Even they were restless, for this 3
case had held vague elements in the background which pleased them not at all. 3
Dr. Willett was thinking deeply and rapidly, and his thoughts were terrible ones. 3
Now and then he would almost break into muttering as he ran over in his head a 3
new, appalling, and increasingly conclusive chain of nightmare happenings. 3
3
Then Mr. Ward made a sign that the conference was over, and everyone save 3
him and the doctor left the room. It was noon now, but shadows as of coming 3
night seemed to engulf the phantom-haunted mansion. Willett began talking 3
very seriously to his host, and urged that he leave a great deal of the future 3
investigation to him. There would be, he predicted, certain obnoxious elements 3
which a friend could bear better than a relative. As family physician he must 3
have a free hand, and the first thing he required was a period alone and 3
undisturbed in the abandoned library upstairs, where the ancient overmantel 3
had gathered about itself an aura of noisome horror more intense than when 3
Joseph Curwen's features themselves glanced slyly down from the painted 3
panel. 3
3
Mr. Ward, dazed by the flood of grotesque morbidities and unthinkably 3
maddening suggestions that poured in upon him from every side, could only 3
acquiesce; and half an hour later the doctor was locked in the shunned room 3
with the panelling from Olney Court. The father, listening outside, heard 3
fumbling sounds of moving and rummaging as the moments passed; and finally 3
a wrench and a creak, as if a tight cupboard door were being opened. Then there 3
was a muffled cry, a kind of snorting choke, and a hasty slamming of whatever 3
had been opened. Almost at once the key rattled and Willett appeared in the hall, 3
haggard and ghastly, and demanding wood for the real fireplace on the south 3
wall of the room. The furnace was not enough, he said; and the electric log had 3
little practical use. Longing yet not daring to ask questions, Mr. Ward gave the 3
requisite orders and a man brought some stout pine logs, shuddering as he 3
entered the tainted air of the library to place them in the grate. Willett meanwhile 3
had gone up to the dismantled laboratory and brought down a few odds and 3
3
3
3
393 3
3
3
3
ends not included in the moving of the July before. They were in a covered 3
basket, and Mr. Ward never saw what they were. 3
3
Then the doctor locked himself in the library once more, and by the clouds of 3
smoke which rolled down past the windows from the chimney it was known that 3
he had lighted the fire. Later, after a great rustling of newspapers, that odd 3
wrench and creaking were heard again; followed by a thumping which none of 3
the eavesdroppers liked. Thereafter two suppressed cries of Willett's were heard, 3
and hard upon these came a swishing rustle of indefinable hatefulness. Finally 3
the smoke that the wind beat down from the chimney grew very dark and acrid, 3
and everyone wished that the weather had spared them this choking and 3
venomous inundation of peculiar fumes. Mr. Ward's head reeled, and the 3
servants all clustered together in a knot to watch the horrible black smoke swoop 3
down. After an age of waiting the vapours seemed to lighted, and half-formless 3
sounds of scraping, sweeping, and other minor operations were heard behind 3
the bolted door. And at last, after the slamming of some cupboard within, Willett 3
made his appearance - sad, pale, and haggard, and bearing the cloth-draped 3
basket he had taken from the upstairs laboratory. He had left the window open, 3
and into that once accursed room was pouring a wealth of pure, wholesome air 3
to mix with a queer new smell of disinfectants. The ancient overmantel still 3
lingered; but it seemed robbed of malignity now, and rose as calm and stately in 3
its white panelling as if it had never borne the picture of Joseph Curwen. Night 3
was coming on, yet this time its shadows held no latent fright, but only a gentle 3
melancholy. Of what he had done the doctor would never speak. To Mr. Ward 3
he said, 'I can answer no questions, but I will say that there are different kinds of 3
magic. I have made a great purgation, and those in this house will sleep the 3
better for it.' 3
3
3
3
That Dr. Willett's "purgation" had been an ordeal almost as nerve-racking in its 3
way as his hideous wandering in the vanished crypt is shewn by the fact that the 3
elderly physician gave out completely as soon as he reached home that evening. 3
For three days he rested constantly in his room, though servants later muttered 3
something about having heard him after midnight on Wednesday, when the 3
outer door softly opened and closed with phenomenal softness. Servants' 3
imaginations, fortunately, are limited, else comment might have been excited by 3
an item in Thursday's Evening Bulletin which ran as follows: 3
3
North End Ghouls Again Active 3
3
After a lull of ten months since the dastardly vandalism in the Weeden lot at the 3
North Burial Ground, a nocturnal prowler was glimpsed early this morning in 3
3
3
3
394 3
3
3
3
the same cemetery by Robert Hart, the night watchman. Happening to glance for 3
a moment from his shelter at about 2 a.m.. Hart observed the glow of a lantern or 3
pocket torch not far to the northwest, and upon opening the door detected the 3
figure of a man with a trowel very plainly silhouetted against a nearby electric 3
light. At once starting in pursuit, he saw the figure dart hurriedly toward the 3
main entrance, gaining the street and losing himself among the shadows before 3
approach or capture was possible. 3
3
Like the first of the ghouls active during the past year, this intruder had done no 3
real damage before detection. A vacant part of the Ward lot shewed signs of a 3
little superficial digging, but nothing even nearly the size of a grave had been 3
attempted, and no previous grave had been disturbed. 3
3
Hart, who cannot describe the prowler except as a small man probably having a 3
full beard, inclines to the view that all three of the digging incidents have a 3
common source; but police from the Second Station think otherwise on account 3
of the savage nature of teh second incident, where an ancient coffin was removed 3
and its headstone violently shattered. 3
3
The first of the incidents, in which it is thought an attempt to bury something 3
was frustrated, occurred a year ago last March, and has been attributed to 3
bootleggers seeking a cache. It is possible, says Sergt. Riley, that this third affair 3
is of similar nature. Officers at the Second Station are taking especial pains to 3
capture the gang of miscreants responsible for these repeated outrages. 3
3
All day Thursday Dr. Willett rested as if recuperating from something past or 3
nerving himself for something to come. In the evening he wrote a note to Mr. 3
Ward, which was delivered the next morning and which caused the half-dazed 3
parent to ponder long and deeply. Mr. Ward had not been able to go down to 3
business since the shock of Monday with its baffling reports and its sinister 3
"purgation", but he found something calming about the doctor's letter in spite of 3
the despair it seemed to promise and the fresh mysteries it seemed to evoke. 3

Dear Theodore:- 3
3
I feel that I must say a word to you before doing what I am going to do 3
tomorrow. It will conclude the terrible business we have been going through (for 3
I feel that no spade is ever likely to reach that monstrous place we know of), but 3
3
3
3
395 3
3
3
3
I'm afraid it won't set your mind at rest unless I expressly assure you how very 3
conclusive it is. 3
3
You have known me ever since you were a small boy, so I think you will not 3
distrust me when I hint that some matters are best left undecided and 3
unexplored. It is better that you attempt no further speculation as to Charles's 3
case, and almost imperative that you tell his mother nothing more than she 3
already suspects. When I call on you tomorrow Charles will have escaped. That 3
is all which need remain in anyone's mind. He was mad, and he escaped. You 3
can tell his mother gently and gradually about the mad part when you stop 3
sending the typed notes in his name. I'd advise you to join her in Atlantic City 3
and take a rest yourself. God knows you need one after this shock, as I do myself. 3
I am going South for a while to calm down and brace up. 3
3
So don't ask me any questions when I call. It may be that something will go 3
wrong, but I'll tell you if it does. I don't think it will. There will be nothing more 3
to worry about, for Charles will be very, very safe. He is now - safer than you 3
dream. You need hold no fears about Allen, and who or what he is. He forms as 3
much a part of the past as Joseph Curwen's picture, and when I ring your 3
doorbell you may feel certain that there is no such person. And what wrote that 3
minuscule message will never trouble you or yours. 3
3
But you must steel yourself to melancholy, and prepare your wife to do the 3
same. I must tell you frankly that Charles's escape will not mean his restoration 3
to you. He has been afflicted with a peculiar disease, as you must realise from the 3
subtle physical as well as mental changes in him, and you must not hope to see 3
him again. Have only this consolation - that he was never a fiend or even truly a 3
madman, but only an eager, studious, and curious boy whose love of mystery 3
and of the past was his undoing. He stumbled on things no mortal ought ever to 3
know, and reached back through the years as no one ever should reach; and 3
something came out of those years to engulf him. 3
3
And now comes the matter in which I must ask you to trust me most of all. For 3
there will be, indeed, no uncertainty about Charles's fate. In about a year, say, 3
you can if you wish devise a suitable account of the end; for the boy will be no 3
more. You can put up a stone in your lot at the North Burial Ground exactly ten 3
feet west of your father's and facing the same way, and that will mark the true 3
resting-place of your son. Nor need you fear that it will mark any abnormality or 3
changeling. The ashes in that grave will be those of your own unaltered bone and 3
sinew - of the real Charles Dexter Ward whose mind you watched from infancy - 3
the real Charles with the olive-mark on his hip and without the black witch-mark 3
on his chest or the pit on his forehead. The Charles who never did actual evil, 3
and who will have paid with his life for his "squeamishness". 3
3
3
3
396 3
3
3
3
That is all. Charles will have escaped, and a year from now you can put up his 3
stone. Do not question me tomorrow. And believe that the honour of your 3
ancient family remains untainted now, as it has been at all times in the past. 3
3
With profoundest sympathy, and exhortations to fortitude, calmness, and 3
resignation, I am ever 3
3
Sincerely your friend, 3
3
Marinus B. Willett. 3
3
So on the morning of Friday, April 13, 1928, Marinus Bicknell Willett visited the 3
room of Charles Dexter Ward at Dr. Waite's private hospital on Conanicut 3
Island. The youth, though making no attempt to evade his caller, was in a sullen 3
mood; and seemed disinclined to open the conversation which Willett obviously 3
desired. The doctor's discovery of the crypt and his monstrous experience 3
therein had of course created a new source of embarrassment, so that both 3
hesitated perceptibly after the interchange of a few strained formalities. Then a 3
new element of constraint crept in, as Ward seemed to read behind the doctor's 3
mask-like face a terrible purpose which had never been there before. The patient 3
quailed, conscious that since the last visit there had been a change whereby the 3
solicitous family physician had given place to the ruthless and implacable 3
avenger. 3
3
Ward actually turned pale, and the doctor was the first to speak. 'More,' he said, 3
'has been found out, and I must warn you fairly that a reckoning is due.' 3
3
'Digging again, and coming upon more poor starving pets?' was the ironic reply. 3
It was evident that the youth meant to shew bravado to the last. 3
3
'No,' Willett slowly rejoined, 'this time I did not have to dig. We have had men 3
looking up Dr. Allen, and they found the false beard and spectacles in the 3
bungalow.' 3
3
'Excellent,' commented the disquieted host in an effort to be wittily insulting, 3
'and I trust they proved more becoming than the beard and glasses you now 3
have on!' 3
3
'They would become you very well,' came the even and studied response, 'as 3
indeed they seem to have done.' 3
3
As Willett said this, it almost seemed as though a cloud passed over the sun; 3
though there was no change in the shadows on the floor. Then Ward ventured: 3
3
3
3
397 3
3
3
3
'And is this what asks so hotly for a reckoning? Suppose a man does find it now 3
and then useful to be twofold?' 3
3
'No', said Willett gravely, 'again you are wrong. It is no business of mine if any 3
man seeks duality; provided he has any right to exist at all, and provided he does 3
not destroy what called him out of space.' 3
3
Ward now started violently. 'Well, Sir, what have ye found, and what d'ye want 3
of me?' 3
3
The doctor let a little time elapse before replying, as if choosing his words for an 3
effective answer. 3
3
'I have found', he finally intoned, 'something in a cupboard behind an ancient 3
overmantel where a picture once was, and I have burned it and buried the ashes 3
where the grave of Charles Dexter Ward ought to be.' 3
3
The madman choked and sprang from the chair in which he had been sitting: 3
3
'Damn ye, who did ye tell - and who'll believe it was he after these two full 3
months, with me alive? What d'ye mean to do?' 3
3
Willett, though a small man, actually took on a kind of judicial majesty as he 3
calmed the patient with a gesture. 3
3
'I have told no one. This is no common case - it is a madness out of time and a 3
horror from beyond the spheres which no police or lawyers or courts or alienists 3
could ever fathom or grapple with. Thank God some chance has left inside me 3
the spark of imagination, that I might not go astray in thinking out this thing. 3
You cannot deceive me, Joseph Curwen, for I know that your accursed magic is 3
true!' 3
3
'I know how you wove the spell that brooded outside the years and fastened on 3
your double and descendant; I know how you drew him into the past and got 3
him to raise you up from your detestable grave; I know how he kept you hidden 3
in his laboratory while you studied modern things and roved abroad as a 3
vampire by night, and how you later shewed yourself in beard and glasses that 3
no one might wonder at your godless likeness to him; I know what you resolved 3
to do when he balked at your monstrous rifling of the world's tombs, and at 3
what you planned afterward , and I know how you did it.' 3
3
'You left off your beard and glasses and fooled the guards around the house. 3
They thought it was he who went in, and they thought it was he who came out 3
when you had strangled and hidden him. But you hadn't reckoned on the 3
3
3
3
398 3
3
3
3
different contents of two minds. You were a fool, Joseph Curwen, to fancy that a 3
mere visual identity would be enough. Why didn't you think of the speech and 3
the voice and the handwriting? It hasn't worked, you see, after all. You know 3
better than I who or what wrote that message in minuscules, but I will warn you 3
it was not written in vain. There are abominations and blasphemies which must 3
be stamped out, and I believe that the writer of those words will attend to Orne 3
and Hutchinson. One of those creatures wrote you once, "do not call up any that 3
you can not put down". You were undone once before, perhaps in that very way, 3
and it may be that your own evil magic will undo you all again. Curwen, a man 3
can't tamper with Nature beyond certain limits, and every horror you have 3
woven will rise up to wipe you out.' 3
3
But here the doctor was cut short by a convulsive cry from the creature before 3
him. Hopelessly at bay, weaponless, and knowing that any show of physical 3
violence would bring a score of attendants to the doctor's rescue, Joseph Curwen 3
had recourse to his one ancient ally, and began a series of cabbalistic motions 3
with his forefingers as his deep, hollow voice, now unconcealed by feigned 3
hoarseness, bellowed out the opening words of a terrible formula. 3
3
'PER ADONAI ELOIM, ADONAI JEHOVA, ADONAI SABAOTH, METRATON 3
3
3
3
But Willett was too quick for him. Even as the dogs in the yard outside began to 3
howl, and even as a chill wind sprang suddenly up from the bay, the doctor 3
commenced the solemn and measured intonation of that which he had meant all 3
along to recite. An eye for an eye - magic for magic - let the outcome shew how 3
well the lesson of the abyss had been learned! So in a clear voice Marinus 3
Bicknell Willett began the second of that pair of formulae whose first had raised 3
the writer of those minuscules - the cryptic invocation whose heading was the 3
Dragon's Tail, sign of the descending node - 3
3
OGTHROD AI'F 3
3
GEB'L-EE'H 3
3
YOG-SOTHOTH 3
3
'NGAH'NG AI'Y 3
3
ZHRO! 3
3
At the very first word from Willett's mouth the previously commenced formula 3
of the patient stopped short. Unable to speak, the monster made wild motions 3
with his arms until they too were arrested. When the awful name of Yog-Sothoth 3
was uttered, the hideous change began. It was not merely a dissolution, but 3
rather a transformation or recapitulation; and Willett shut his eyes lest he faint 3
before the rest of the incantation could be pronounced. 3
3
3
3
399 3
3
3
3
But he did not faint, and that man of unholy centuries and forbidden secrets 3
never troubled the world again. The madness out of time had subsided, and the 3
case of Charles Dexter Ward was closed. Opening his eyes before staggering out 3
of that room of horror. Dr. Willett saw that what he had kept in memory had not 3
been kept amiss. There had, as he had predicted, been no need for acids. For like 3
his accursed picture a year before, Joseph Curwen now lay scattered on the floor 3
as a thin coating of fine bluish-grey dust. 3

The Cats of Ulthar 3
3
Written on JunelS, 1920 3
3
Published in November 1920 in The Tryout 3
3
It is said that in Ulthar, which lies beyond the river Skai, no man may kill a cat; 3
and this I can verily believe as I gaze upon him who sitteth purring before the 3
fire. For the cat is cryptic, and close to strange things which men cannot see. He 3
is the soul of antique Aegyptus, and bearer of tales from forgotten cities in Meroe 3
and Ophir. He is the kin of the jungle's lords, and heir to the secrets of hoary and 3
sinister Africa. The Sphinx is his cousin, and he speaks her language; but he is 3
more ancient than the Sphinx, and remembers that which she hath forgotten. 3
3
In Ulthar, before ever the burgesses forbade the killing of cats, there dwelt an old 3
cotter and his wife who delighted to trap and slay the cats of their neighbors. 3
Why they did this I know not; save that many hate the voice of the cat in the 3
night, and take it ill that cats should run stealthily about yards and gardens at 3
twilight. But whatever the reason, this old man and woman took pleasure in 3
trapping and slaying every cat which came near to their hovel; and from some of 3
the sounds heard after dark, many villagers fancied that the manner of slaying 3
was exceedingly peculiar. But the villagers did not discuss such things with the 3
old man and his wife; because of the habitual expression on the withered faces of 3
the two, and because their cottage was so small and so darkly hidden under 3
spreading oaks at the back of a neglected yard. In truth, much as the owners of 3
cats hated these odd folk, they feared them more; and instead of berating them as 3
brutal assassins, merely took care that no cherished pet or mouser should stray 3
toward the remote hovel under the dark trees. When through some unavoidable 3
oversight a cat was missed, and sounds heard after dark, the loser would lament 3
impotently; or console himself by thanking Fate that it was not one of his 3
children who had thus vanished. For the people of Ulthar were simple, and knew 3
not whence it is all cats first came. 3
3
One day a caravan of strange wanderers from the South entered the narrow 3
cobbled streets of Ulthar. Dark wanderers they were, and unlike the other roving 3
folk who passed through the village twice every year. In the market-place they 3
told fortunes for silver, and bought gay beads from the merchants. What was the 3
land of these wanderers none could tell; but it was seen that they were given to 3
strange prayers, and that they had painted on the sides of their wagons strange 3
figures with human bodies and the heads of cats, hawks, rams and lions. And the 3
leader of the caravan wore a headdress with two horns and a curious disk 3
betwixt the horns. 3
3
3
3

3
3
3
There was in this singular caravan a Httle boy with no father or mother, but only 3
a tiny black kitten to cherish. The plague had not been kind to him, yet had left 3
him this small furry thing to mitigate his sorrow; and when one is very young, 3
one can find great relief in the lively antics of a black kitten. So the boy whom the 3
dark people called Menes smiled more often than he wept as he sat playing with 3
his graceful kitten on the steps of an oddly painted wagon. 3
3
On the third morning of the wanderers' stay in Ulthar, Menes could not find his 3
kitten; and as he sobbed aloud in the market-place certain villagers told him of 3
the old man and his wife, and of sounds heard in the night. And when he heard 3
these things his sobbing gave place to meditation, and finally to prayer. He 3
stretched out his arms toward the sun and prayed in a tongue no villager could 3
understand; though indeed the villagers did not try very hard to understand, 3
since their attention was mostly taken up by the sky and the odd shapes the 3
clouds were assuming. It was very peculiar, but as the little boy uttered his 3
petition there seemed to form overhead the shadowy, nebulous figures of exotic 3
things; of hybrid creatures crowned with horn-flanked disks. Nature is full of 3
such illusions to impress the imaginative. 3
3
That night the wanderers left Ulthar, and were never seen again. And the 3
householders were troubled when they noticed that in all the village there was 3
not a cat to be found. From each hearth the familiar cat had vanished; cats large 3
and small, black, grey, striped, yellow and white. Old Kranon, the burgomaster, 3
swore that the dark folk had taken the cats away in revenge for the killing of 3
Menes' kitten; and cursed the caravan and the little boy. But Nith, the lean 3
notary, declared that the old cotter and his wife were more likely persons to 3
suspect; for their hatred of cats was notorious and increasingly bold. Still, no one 3
durst complain to the sinister couple; even when little Atal, the innkeeper's son, 3
vowed that he had at twilight seen all the cats of Ulthar in that accursed yard 3
under the trees, pacing very slowly and solemnly in a circle around the cottage, 3
two abreast, as if in performance of some unheard-of rite of beasts. The villagers 3
did not know how much to believe from so small a boy; and though they feared 3
that the evil pair had charmed the cats to their death, they preferred not to chide 3
the old cotter till they met him outside his dark and repellent yard. 3
3
So Ulthar went to sleep in vain anger; and when the people awakened at dawn— 3
behold! every cat was back at his accustomed hearth! Large and small, black, 3
grey, striped, yellow and white, none was missing. Very sleek and fat did the 3
cats appear, and sonorous with purring content. The citizens talked with one 3
another of the affair, and marveled not a little. Old Kranon again insisted that it 3
was the dark folk who had taken them, since cats did not return alive from the 3
cottage of the ancient man and his wife. But all agreed on one thing: that the 3
refusal of all the cats to eat their portions of meat or drink their saucers of milk 3
3
3
3
402 3
3
3
3
was exceedingly curious. And for two whole days the sleek, lazy cats of Ulthar 3
would touch no food, but only doze by the fire or in the sun. 3
3
It was fully a week before the villagers noticed that no lights were appearing at 3
dusk in the windows of the cottage under the trees. Then the lean Nith remarked 3
that no one had seen the old man or his wife since the night the cats were away. 3
In another week the burgomaster decided to overcome his fears and call at the 3
strangely silent dwelling as a matter of duty, though in so doing he was careful 3
to take with him Shang the blacksmith and Thul the cutter of stone as witnesses. 3
And when they had broken down the frail door they found only this: two cleanly 3
picked human skeletons on the earthen floor, and a number of singular beetles 3
crawling in the shadowy corners. 3
3
There was subsequently much talk among the burgesses of Ulthar. Zath, the 3
coroner, disputed at length with Nith, the lean notary; and Kranon and Shang 3
and Thul were overwhelmed with questions. Even little Atal, the innkeeper's 3
son, was closely questioned and given a sweetmeat as reward. They talked of the 3
old cotter and his wife, of the caravan of dark wanderers, of small Menes and his 3
black kitten, of the prayer of Menes and of the sky during that prayer, of the 3
doings of the cats on the night the caravan left, and of what was later found in 3
the cottage under the dark trees in the repellent yard. 3
3
And in the end the burgesses passed that remarkable law which is told of by 3
traders in Hatheg and discussed by travelers in Nir; namely, that in Ulthar no 3
man may kill a cat. 3

The Colour Out of Space 3

3
West of Arkham the hills rise wild, and there are valleys with deep woods that 3
no axe has ever cut. There are dark narrow glens where the trees slope 3
fantastically, and where thin brooklets trickle without ever having caught the 3
glint of sunlight. On the gentle slopes there are farms, ancient and rocky, with 3
squat, moss-coated cottages brooding eternally over old New England secrets in 3
the lee of great ledges; but these are all vacant now, the wide chimneys 3
crumbling and the shingled sides bulging perilously beneath low gambrel roofs. 3
3
The old folk have gone away, and foreigners do not like to live there. French- 3
Canadians have tried it, Italians have tried it, and the Poles have come and 3
departed. It is not because of anything that can be seen or heard or handled, but 3
because of something that is imagined. The place is not good for imagination, 3
and does not bring restful dreams at night. It must be this which keeps the 3
foreigners away, for old Ammi Pierce has never told them of anything he recalls 3
from the strange days. Ammi, whose head has been a little queer for years, is the 3
only one who still remains, or who ever talks of the strange days; and he dares to 3
do this because his house is so near the open fields and the travelled roads 3
around Arkham. 3
3
There was once a road over the hills and through the valleys, that ran straight 3
where the blasted heath is now; but people ceased to use it and a new road was 3
laid curving far toward the south. Traces of the old one can still be found amidst 3
the weeds of a returning wilderness, and some of them will doubtless linger even 3
when half the hollows are flooded for the new reservoir. Then the dark woods 3
will be cut down and the blasted heath will slumber far below blue waters whose 3
surface will mirror the sky and ripple in the sun. And the secrets of the strange 3
days will be one with the deep's secrets; one with the hidden lore of old ocean, 3
and all the mystery of primal earth. 3
3
When I went into the hills and vales to survey for the new reservoir they told me 3
the place was evil. They told me this in Arkham, and because that is a very old 3
town full of witch legends I thought the evil must he something which grandams 3
had whispered to children through centuries. The name "blasted heath" seemed 3
to me very odd and theatrical, and I wondered how it had come into the folklore 3
of a Puritan people. Then I saw that dark westward tangle of glens and slopes for 3
myself, end ceased to wonder at anything beside its own elder mystery. It was 3
3
3
3
404 3
3
3
3
morning when I saw it, but shadow lurked always there. The trees grew too 3
thickly, and their trunks were too big for any healthy New England wood. There 3
was too much silence in the dim alleys between them, and the floor was too soft 3
with the dank moss and mattings of infinite years of decay. 3
3
In the open spaces, mostly along the line of the old road, there were little hillside 3
farms; sometimes with all the buildings standing, sometimes with only 6ne or 3
two, and sometimes with only a lone chimney or fast-filling cellar. Weeds and 3
briers reigned, and furtive wild things rustled in the undergrowth. Upon 3
everything was a haze of restlessness and oppression; a touch of the unreal and 3
the grotesque, as if some vital element of perspective or chiaroscuro were awry. I 3
did not wonder that the foreigners would not stay, for this was no region to sleep 3
in. It was too much like a landscape of Salvator Rosa; too much like some 3
forbidden woodcut in a tale of terror. 3
3
But even all this was not so bad as the blasted heath. I knew it the moment I 3
came upon it at the bottom of a spacious valley; for no other name could fit such 3
a thing, or any other thing fit such a name. It was as if the poet had coined the 3
phrase from having seen this one particular region. It must, I thought as I viewed 3
it, be the outcome of a fire; but why had nothing new ever grown over these five 3
acres of grey desolation that sprawled open to the sky like a great spot eaten by 3
acid in the woods and fields? It lay largely to the north of the ancient road line, 3
but encroached a little on the other side. I felt an odd reluctance about 3
approaching, and did so at last only because my business took me through and 3
past it. There was no vegetation of any kind on that broad expanse, but only a 3
fine grey dust or ash which no wind seemed ever to blow about. The trees near it 3
were sickly and stunted, and many dead trunks stood or lay rotting at the rim. 3
As I walked hurriedly by I saw the tumbled bricks and stones of an old chimney 3
and cellar on my right, and the yawning black maw of an abandoned well whose 3
stagnant vapours played strange tricks with the hues of the sunlight. Even the 3
long, dark woodland climb beyond seemed welcome in contrast, and I marvelled 3
no more at the frightened whispers of Arkham people. There had been no house 3
or ruin near; even in the old days the place must have been lonely and remote. 3
And at twilight, dreading to repass that ominous spot, I walked circuitously back 3
to the town by the curious road on the south. I vaguely wished some clouds 3
would gather, for an odd timidity about the deep skyey voids above had crept 3
into my soul. 3
3
In the evening I asked old people in Arkham about the blasted heath, and what 3
was meant by that phrase "strange days" which so many evasively muttered. I 3
could not, however, get any good answersl except that all the mystery was much 3
more recent than I had dreamed. It was not a matter of old legendry at all, but 3
something within the lifetime of those who spoke. It had happened in the 3
3
3
3
405 3
3
3
3
'eighties, and a family had disappeared or was killed. Speakers would not be 3
exact; and because they all told me to pay no attention to old Ammi Pierce's 3
crazy tales, I sought him out the next morning, having heard that he lived alone 3
in the ancient tottering cottage where the trees first begin to get very thick. It was 3
a fearsomely ancient place, and had begun to exude the faint miasmal odour 3
which clings about houses that have stood too long. Only with persistent 3
knocking could I rouse the aged man, and when he shuffled timidly to the door 3
could could tell he was not glad to see me. He was not so feeble as I had 3
expected; but his eyes drooped in a curious way, and his unkempt clothing and 3
white beard made him seem very worn and dismal. 3
3
Not knowing just how he could best be launched on his tales, I feigned a matter 3
of business; told him of my surveying, and asked vague questions about the 3
district. He was far brighter and more educated than I had been led to think, and 3
before I knew it had graNped quite as much of the subject as any man I had 3
talked with in Arkham. He was not like other rustics I bad known in the sections 3
where reservoirs were to be. From him there were no protests at the miles of old 3
wood and farmland to be blotted out, though perhaps there would have been 3
had not his home lain outside the bounds of the future lake. Relief was all that he 3
showed; relief at the doom of the dark ancient valleys through which he had 3
roamed all his life. They were better under water now - better under water since 3
the strange days. And with this opening his husky voice sank low, while his 3
body leaned forward and his right forefinger began to point shakily and 3
impressively. 3
3
It was then that I heard the story, and as the rambling voice scraped and 3
whispered on I shivered again and again spite the summer day. Often I had to 3
recall the speaker from ramblings, piece out scientific points which he knew only 3
by a fading parrot memory of professors' talk, or bridge over gaps, where his 3
sense of logic and continuity broke down. When he was done I did not wonder 3
that his mind had snapped a trifle, or that the folk of Arkham would not speak 3
much of the blasted heath. I hurried back before sunset to my hotel, unwilling to 3
have the stars come out above me in the open; and the next day returned to - 3
Boston to give up my position. I could not go into that dim chaos of old forest 3
and slope again, or face another time that grey blasted heath where the black 3
well yawned deep beside the tumbled bricks and stones. The reservoir will soon 3
be built now, and all those elder secrets will be safe forever under watery 3
fathoms. But even then I do not believe I would like to visit that country by night 3
- at least not when the sinister stars are out; and nothing could bribe me to drink 3
the new city water of Arkham. 3
3
It all began, old Ammi said, with the meteorite. Before that time there had been 3
no wild legends at all since the witch trials, and even then these western woods 3
3
3
3
406 3
3
3
3
were not feared half so much as the small island in the Miskatonic where the 3
devil held court beside a curious 'lone altar older than the Indians. These were 3
not haunted woods, and their fantastic dusk was never terrible till the strange 3
days. Then there had come that white noontide cloud, that string of explosions in 3
the air, and that pillar of smoke from the valley far in the wood. And by night all 3
Arkham had heard of the great rock that fell out of the sky and bedded itself in 3
the ground beside the well at the Nahum Gardner place. That was the house 3
which had stood where the blasted heath was to come - the trim white Nahum 3
Gardner house amidst its fertile gardens and orchards. 3
3
Nahum had come to town to tell people about the stone, and dropped in at 3
Ammi Pierce's on the way. Ammi was forty then, and all the queer things were 3
fixed very strongly in his mind. He and his wife had gone with the three 3
professors from Miskatonic University who hastened out the next morning to see 3
the weird visitor from unknown stellar space, and had wondered why Nahum 3
had called it so large the day before. It had shrunk, Nahum said as he pointed 3
out the big brownish mound above the ripped earth and charred grass near the 3
archaic well-sweep in his front yard; but the wise men answered that stones do 3
not shrink. Its heat lingered persistently, and Nahum declared it had glowed 3
faintly in the night. The professors tried it with a geologist's hammer and found 3
it was oddly soft. It was, in truth, so soft as to be almost plastic; and they gouged 3
rather than chipped a specimen to take back to the college for testing. They took 3
it in an old pail borrowed from Nahum's kitchen, for even the small piece 3
refused to grow cool. On the trip back they stopped at Ammi's to rest, and 3
seemed thoughtful when Mrs. Pierce remarked that the fragment was growing 3
smaller and burning the bottom of the pail. Truly, it was not large, but perhaps 3
they had taken less than they thought. 3
3
The day after that-all this was in June of '82-the professors had trooped out again 3
in a great excitement. As they passed Ammi's they told him what queer things 3
the specimen had done, and how it had faded wholly away when they put it in a 3
glass beaker. The beaker had gone, too, and the wise men talked of the strange 3
stone's affinity for silicon. It had acted quite unbelievably in that well-ordered 3
laboratory; doing nothing at all and showing no occluded gases when heated on 3
charcoal, being wholly negative in the borax bead, and soon proving itself 3
absolutely non-volatile at any producible temperature, including that of the oxy- 3
hydrogen blowpipe. On an anvil it appeared highly malleable, and in the dark its 3
luminosity was very marked. Stubbornly refusing to grow cool, it soon had the 3
college in a state of real excitement; and when upon heating before the 3
spectroscope it displayed shining bands unlike any known colours of the normal 3
spectrum there was much breathless talk of new elements, bizarre optical 3
properties, and other things which puzzled men of science are wont to say when 3
faced by the unknown. 3
3
3
3
407 3
3
3
3
Hot as it was, they tested it in a crucible with all the proper reagents. Water did 3
nothing. Hydrochloric acid was the same. Nitric acid and even aqua regia merely 3
hissed and spattered against its torrid invulnerability. Ammi had difficulty in 3
recalling all these things, but recognized some solvents as I mentioned them in 3
the usual order of use. There were am monia and caustic soda, alcohol and ether, 3
nauseous carbon disulphide and a dozen others; but although the weight grew 3
steadily less as time passed, and the fragment seemed to be slightly cooling, 3
there was no change in the solvents to show that they had attacked the substance 3
at all. It was a metal, though, beyond a doubt. It was magnetic, for one thing; and 3
after its immersion in the acid solvents there seemed to be faint traces of the 3
Widmanstatten figures found on meteoric iron. When the cooling had grown 3
very considerable, the testing was carried on in glass; and it was in a glass beaker 3
that they left all the chips made of the original fragment during the work. The 3
next morning both chips and beaker were gone without trace, and only a charred 3
spot marked the place on the wooden shelf where they had been. 3
3
All this the professors told Ammi as they paused at his door, and once more he 3
went with them to see the stony messenger from the stars, though this time his 3
wife did not accompany him. It had now most cer tainly shrunk, and even the 3
sober professors could not doubt the truth of what they saw. All around the 3
dwindling brown lump near the well was a vacant space, except where the earth 3
had caved in; and whereas it had been a good seven feet across the day before, it 3
was now scarcely five. It was still hot, and the sages studied its surface curiously 3
as they detached another and larger piece with hammer and chisel. They gouged 3
deeply this time, and as they pried away the smaller mass they saw that the core 3
of the thing was not quite homogeneous. 3
3
They had uncovered what seemed to be the side of a large coloured globule 3
embedded in the substance. The colour, which resembled some of the bands in 3
the meteor's strange spectrum, was almost impossible to describe; and it was 3
only by analogy that they called it colour at all. Its texture was glossy, and upon 3
tapping it appeared to promise both brittle ness and hollowness. One of the 3
professors gave it a smart blow with a hammer, and it burst with a nervous little 3
pop. Nothing was emitted, and all trace of the thing vanished with the 3
puncturing. It left behind a hollow spherical space about three inches across, and 3
all thought it probable that others would be discovered as the enclosing 3
substance wasted away. 3
3
Conjecture was vain; so after a futile attempt to find additional globules by 3
drilling, the seekers left again with their new specimen which proved, however, 3
as baffling in the laboratory as its predecessor. Aside from being almost plastic, 3
having heat, magnetism, and slight luminosity, cooling slightly in powerful 3
acids, possessing an unknown spec trum, wasting away in air, and attacking 3
3
3
3
408 3
3
3
3
silicon compounds with mutual destruction as a result, it presented no 3
identifying features whatsoever; and at the end of the tests the college scientists 3
were forced to own that they could not place it. It was nothing of this earth, but a 3
piece of the great outside; and as such dowered with outside properties and 3
obedient to outside laws. 3
3
That night there was a thunderstorm, and when the professors went out to 3
Nahum's the next day they met with a bitter disappointment. The stone, 3
magnetic as it had been, must have had some peculiar electrical property; for it 3
had "drawn the lightning," as Nahum said, with a singular persistence. Six times 3
within an hour the farmer saw the lightning strike the furrow in the front yard, 3
and when the storm was over nothing remained but a ragged pit by the ancient 3
well-sweep, half-choked with a caved-in earth. Digging had borne no fruit, and 3
the scientists verified the fact of the utter vanishment. The failure was total; so 3
that nothing was left to do but go back to the laboratory and test again the 3
disappearing fragment left carefully cased in lead. That fragment lasted a week, 3
at the end of which nothing of value had been learned of it. When it had gone, no 3
residue was left behind, and in time the professors felt scarcely sure they had 3
indeed seen with waking eyes that cryptic vestige of the fathomless gulfs 3
outside; that lone, weird message from other universes and other realms of 3
matter, force, and entity. 3
3
As was natural, the Arkham papers made much of the incident with its collegiate 3
sponsoring, and sent reporters to talk with Nahum Gardner and his family. At 3
least one Boston daily also sent a scribe, and Nahum quickly became a kind of 3
local celebrity. He was a lean, genial person of about fifty, living with his wife 3
and three sons on the pleasant farmstead in the valley. He and Ammi exchanged 3
visits frequently, as did their wives; and Ammi had nothing but praise for him 3
after all these years. He seemed slightly proud of the notice his place had 3
attracted, and talked often of the meteorite in the succeeding weeks. That July 3
and August were hot; and Nahum worked hard at his haying in the ten-acre 3
pasture across Chapman's Brook; his rattling wain wearing deep ruts in the 3
shadowy lanes between. The labour tired him more than it had in other years, 3
and he felt that age was beginning to tell on him. 3
3
Then fell the time of fruit and harvest. The pears and apples slowly ripened, and 3
Nahum vowed that his orchards were prospering as never before. The fruit was 3
growing to phenomenal size and unwonted gloss, and in such abundance that 3
extra barrels were ordered to handle the future crop. But with the ripening came 3
sore disappointment, for of all that gorgeous array of specious lusciousness not 3
one single jot was fit to eat. Into the fine flavour of the pears and apples had 3
crept a stealthy bitterness and sickishness, so that even the smallest bites induced 3
a lasting disgust. It was the same with the melons and tomatoes, and Nahum 3
3
3
3
409 3
3
3
3
sadly saw that his entire crop was lost. Quick to connect events, he declared that 3
the meteorite had poisoned the soil, and thanked Heaven that most of the other 3
crops were in the upland lot along the road. 3
3
Winter came early, and was very cold. Ammi saw Nahum less often than usual, 3
and observed that he had begun to look worried. The rest of his family too, 3
seemed to have grown taciturn; and were far from steady in their church-going 3
or their attendance at the various social events of the countryside. For this 3
reserve or melancholy no cause could be found, though all the household 3
confessed now and then to poorer health and a feeling of vague disquiet. Nahum 3
himself gave the most definite statement of anyone when he said he was 3
disturbed about certain footprints in the snow. They were the usual winter prints 3
of red squirrels, white rabbits, and foxes, but the brooding farmer professed to 3
see something not quite right about their nature and arrangement. He was never 3
specific, but appeared to think that they were not as characteristic of the anatomy 3
and habits of squirrels and rabbits and foxes as they ought to be. Ammi listened 3
without interest to this talk until one night when he drove past Nahum's house 3
in his sleigh on the way back from Clark's Comer. There had been a moon, and a 3
rabbit had run across the road, and the leaps of that rabbit were longer than 3
either Ammi or his horse liked. The latter, indeed, had almost run away when 3
brought up by a firm rein. Thereafter Ammi gave Nahum's tales more respect, 3
and wondered why the Gardner dogs seemed so cowed and quivering every 3
morning. They had, it developed, nearly lost the spirit to bark. 3
3
In February the McGregor boys from Meadow Hill were out shooting 3
woodchucks, and not far from the Gardner place bagged a very peculiar 3
specimen. The proportions of its body seemed slightly altered in a queer way 3
impossible to describe, while its face had taken on an expression which no one 3
ever saw in a woodchuck before. The boys were genuinely frightened, and threw 3
the thing away at once, so that only their grotesque tales of it ever reached the 3
people of the countryside. But the shying of horses near Nahum's house had 3
now become an acknowledged thing, and all the basis for a cycle of whispered 3
legend was fast taking form. 3
3
People vowed that the snow melted faster around Nahum's than it did anywhere 3
else, and early in March there was an awed discussion in Potter's general store at 3
Clark's Corners. Stephen Rice had driven past Gardner's in the morning, and 3
had noticed the skunk-cabbages coming up through the mud by the woods 3
across the road. Never were things of such size seen before, and they held 3
strange colours that could not be put into any words. Their shapes were 3
monstrous, and the horse had snorted at an odour which struck Stephen as 3
wholly unprecedented. That afternoon several persons drove past to see the 3
abnormal growth, and all agreed that plants of that kind ought never to sprout in 3
3
3
3
410 3
3
3
3
a healthy world. The bad fruit of the fall before was freely mentioned, and it 3
went from mouth to mouth that there was poison in Nahum's ground. Of course 3
it was the meteorite; and remembering how strange the men from the college 3
had found that stone to be, several farmers spoke about the matter to them. 3
3
One day they paid Nahum a visit; but having no love of wild tales and folklore 3
were very conservative in what they inferred. The plants were certainly odd, but 3
all skunk-cabbages are more or less odd in shape and hue. Perhaps some mineral 3
element from the stone had entered the soil, but it would soon be washed away. 3
And as for the footprints and frightened horses - of course this was mere country 3
talk which such a phenomenon as the aerolite would be certain to start. There 3
was really nothing for serious men to do in cases of wild gossip, for superstitious 3
rustics will say and believe anything. And so all through the strange days the 3
professors stayed away in contempt. Only one of them, when given two phials of 3
dust for analysis in a police job over a year and half later, recalled that the queer 3
colour of that skunk-cabbage had been very like one of the anomalous bands of 3
light shown by the meteor fragment in the college spectroscope, and like the 3
brittle globule found imbedded in the stone from the abyss. The samples in this 3
analysis case gave the same odd bands at first, though later they lost the 3
property. 3
3
The trees budded prematurely around Nahum's, and at night they swayed 3
ominously in the wind. Nahum's second son Thaddeus, a lad of fifteen, swore 3
that they swayed also when there was no wind; but even the gossips would not 3
credit this. Certainly, however, restlessness was in the air. The entire Gardner 3
family developed the habit of stealthy listening, though not for any sound which 3
they could consciously name. The listening was, indeed, rather a product of 3
moments when consciousness seemed half to slip away. Unfortunately such 3
moments increased week by week, till it became common speech that 3
"something was wrong with all Nahum's folks." When the early saxifrage came 3
out it had another strange colour; not quite like that of the skunk-cabbage, but 3
plainly related and equally unknown to anyone who saw it. Nahum took some 3
blossoms to Arkham and showed them to the editor of the Gazette, but that 3
dignitary did no more than write a humorous article about them, in which the 3
dark fears of rustics were held up to polite ridicule. It was a mistake of Nahum's 3
to tell a stolid city man about the way the great, overgrown mourning-cloak 3
butterflies behaved in connection with these saxifrages. 3
3
April brought a kind of madness to the country folk, and began that disuse of the 3
road past Nahum's which led to its ultimate abandonment. It was the vegetation. 3
All the orchard trees blossomed forth in strange colours, and through the stony 3
soil of the yard and adjacent pasturage there sprang up a bizarre growth which 3
only a botanist could connect with the proper flora of the region. No sane 3
3
3
3
411 3
3
3
3
wholesome colours were anywhere to be seen except in the green grass and 3
leafage; but everywhere were those hectic and prismatic variants of some 3
diseased, underlying primary tone without a place among the' known tints of 3
earth. The "Dutchman's breeches" became a thing of sinister menace, and the 3
bloodroots grew insolent in their chromatic perversion. Ammi and the Gardners 3
thought that most of the colours had a sort of haunting familiarity, and decided 3
that they reminded one of the brittle globule in the meteor. Nahum ploughed 3
and sowed the ten-acre pasture and the upland lot, but did nothing with the land 3
around the house. He knew it would be of no use, and hoped that the summer's 3
strange growths would draw all the poison from the soil. He was prepared for 3
almost anything now, and had grown used to the sense of something near him 3
waiting to be heard. The shunning of his house by neighbors told on him, of 3
course; but it told on his wife more. The boys were better off, being at school 3
each day; but they could not help being frightened by the gossip. Thaddeus, an 3
especially sensitive youth, suffered the most. 3
3
In May the insects came, and Nahum's place became a nightmare of buzzing and 3
crawling. Most of the creatures seemed not quite usual in their aspects and 3
motions, and their nocturnal habits contradicted all former experience. The 3
Gardners took to watching at night - watching in all directions at random for 3
something - they could not tell what. It was then that they owned that Thaddeus 3
had been right about the trees. Mrs. Gardner was the next to see it from the 3
window as she watched the swollen boughs of a maple against a moonlit sky. 3
The boughs surely moved, and there was no 'wind. It must be the sap. 3
Strangeness had come into everything growing now. Yet it was none of Nahum's 3
family at all who made the next discovery. Familiarity had dulled them, and 3
what they could not see was glimpsed by a timid windmill salesman from Bolton 3
who drove by one night in ignorance of the country legends. What he told in 3
Arkham was given a short paragraph in the Gazette; and it was there that all the 3
farmers, Nahum included, saw it first. The night had been dark and the buggy- 3
lamps faint, but around a farm in the valley which everyone knew from the 3
account must be Nahum's, the darkness had been less thick. A dim though 3
distinct luminosity seemed to inhere in all the vegetation, grass, leaves, and 3
blossoms alike, while at one moment a detached piece of the phosphorescence 3
appeared to stir furtively in the yard near the barn. 3
3
The grass had so far seemed untouched, and the cows were freely pastured in the 3
lot near the house, but toward the end of May the milk began to be bad. Then 3
Nahum had the cows driven to the uplands, after which this trouble ceased. Not 3
long after this the change in grass and leaves became apparent to the eye. All the 3
verdure was going grey, and was developing a highly singular quality of 3
brittleness. Ammi was now the only person who ever visited the place, and his 3
visits were becoming fewer and fewer. When school closed the Gardners were 3
3
3
3
412 3
3
3
3
virtually cut off from the world, and sometimes let Ammi do their errands in 3
town. They were failing curiously both physically and mentally, and no one was 3
surprised when the news of Mrs. Gardner's madness stole around. 3
3
It happened in June, about the anniversary of the meteor's fall, and the poor 3
woman screamed about things in the air which she could not describe. In her 3
raving there was not a single specific noun, but only verbs and pronouns. Things 3
moved and changed and fluttered, and ears tingled to impulses which were not 3
wholly sounds. Something was taken away - she was being drained of something 3
- something was fastening itself on her that ought not to be - someone must make 3
it keep off - nothing was ever still in the night - the walls and windows shifted. 3
Nahum did not send her to the county asylum, but let her wander about the 3
house as long as she was harmless to herself and others. Even when her 3
expression changed he did nothing. But when the boys grew afraid of her, and 3
Thaddeus nearly fainted at the way she made faces at him, he decided to keep 3
her locked in the attic. By July she had ceased to speak and crawled on all fours, 3
and before that month was over Nahum got the mad notion that she was slightly 3
luminous in the dark, as he now clearly saw was the case with the nearby 3
vegetation. 3
3
It was a little before this that the horses had stampeded. Something had aroused 3
them in the night, and their neighing and kicking in their stalls had been terrible. 3
There seemed virtually nothing to do to calm them, and when Nahum opened 3
the stable door they all bolted out like frightened woodland deer. It took a week 3
to track all four, and when found they were seen to be quite useless and 3
unmanageable. Something had snapped in their brains, and each one had to be 3
shot for its own good. Nahum borrowed a horse from Ammi for his haying, but 3
found it would not approach the barn. It shied, balked, and whinnied, and in the 3
end he could do nothing but drive it into the yard while the men used their own 3
strength to get the heavy wagon near enough the hayloft for convenient pitching. 3
And all the while the vegetation was turning grey and brittle. Even the flowers 3
whose hues had been so strange were greying now, and the fruit was coming out 3
grey and dwarfed and tasteless. The asters and golden-rod bloomed grey and 3
distorted, and the roses and zinneas and hollyhocks in the front yard were such 3
blasphemous-looking things that Nahum's oldest boy Zenas cut them down. The 3
strangely puffed insects died about that time, even the bees that had left their 3
hives and taken to the woods. 3
3
By September all the vegetation was fast crumbling to a greyish powder, and 3
Nahum feared that the trees would die before the poison was out of the soil. His 3
wife now had spells of terrific screaming, and he and the boys were in a constant 3
state of nervous tension. They shunned people now, and when school opened the 3
boys did not go. But it was Ammi, on one of his rare visits, who first realised that 3
3
3
3
413 3
3
3
3
the well water was no longer good. It had an evil taste that was not exactly fetid 3
nor exactly salty, and Ammi advised his friend to dig another well on higher 3
ground to use till the soil was good again. Nahum, however, ignored the 3
warning, for he had by that time become calloused to strange and unpleasant 3
things. He and the boys continued to use the tainted supply, drinking it as 3
listlessly and mechanically as they ate their meagre and ill-cooked meals and did 3
their thankless and monotonous chores through the aimless days. There was 3
something of stolid resignation about them all, as if they walked half in another 3
world between lines of nameless guards to a certain and familiar doom. 3
3
Thaddeus went mad in September after a visit to the well. He had gone with a 3
pail and had come back empty-handed, shrieking and waving his arms, and 3
sometimes lapsing into an inane titter or a whisper about "the moving colours 3
down there." Two in one family was pretty bad, but Nahum was very brave 3
about it. He let the boy run about for a week until he began stumbling and 3
hurting himself, and then he shut him in an attic room across the hall from his 3
mother's. The way they screamed at each other from behind their locked doors 3
was very terrible, especially to little Merwin, who fancied they talked in some 3
terrible language that was not of earth. Merwin was getting frightfully 3
imaginative, and his restlessness was worse after the shutting away of the 3
brother who had been his greatest playmate. 3
3
Almost at the same time the mortality among the livestock commenced. Poultry 3
turned greyish and died very quickly, their meat being found dry and noisome 3
upon cutting. Hogs grew inordinately fat, then suddenly began to undergo 3
loathsome changes which no one could explain. Their meat was of course 3
useless, and Nahum was at his wit's end. No rural veterinary would approach 3
his place, and the city veterinary from Arkham was openly baffled. The swine 3
began growing grey and brittle and falling to pieces before they died, and their 3
eyes and muzzles developed singular alterations. It was very inexplicable, for 3
they had never been fed from the tainted vegetation. Then something struck the 3
cows. Certain areas or sometimes the whole body would be uncannily shrivelled 3
or compressed, and atrocious collapses or disintegrations were common. In the 3
last stages - and death was always the result - there would be a greying and 3
turning brittle like that which beset the hogs. There could be no question of 3
poison, for all the cases occurred in a locked and undisturbed barn. No bites of 3
prowling things could have brought the virus, for what live beast of earth can 3
pass through solid obstacles? It must be only natural disease - yet what disease 3
could wreak such results was beyond any mind's guessing. When the harvest 3
came there was not an animal surviving on the place, for the stock and poultry 3
were dead and the dogs had run away. These dogs, three in number, had all 3
vanished one night and were never heard of again. The five cats had left some 3
3
3
3
414 3
3
3
3
time before, but their going was scarcely noticed since there now seemed to be no 3
mice, and only Mrs. Gardner had made pets of the graceful felines. 3
3
On the nineteenth of October Nahum staggered into Ammi's house with hideous 3
news. The death had come to poor Thaddeus in his attic room, and it had come 3
in a way which could not be told. Nahum had dug a grave in the railed family 3
plot behind the farm, and had put therein what he found. There could have been 3
nothing from outside, for the small barred window and locked door were intact; 3
but it was much as it had been in the barn. Ammi and his wife consoled the 3
stricken man as best they could, but shuddered as they did so. Stark terror 3
seemed to cling round the Gardners and all they touched, and the very presence 3
of one in the house was a breath from regions unnamed and unnamable. Ammi 3
accompanied Nahum home with the greatest reluctance, and did what he might 3
to calm the hysterical sobbing of little Merwin. Zenas needed no calming. He had 3
come of late to do nothing but stare into space and obey what his father told him; 3
and Ammi thought that his fate was very merciful. Now and then Merwin's 3
screams were answered faintly from the attic, and in response to an inquiring 3
look Nahum said that his wife was getting very feeble. When night approached, 3
Ammi managed to get away; for not even friendship could make him stay in that 3
spot when the faint glow of the vegetation began and the trees may or may not 3
have swayed without wind. It was really lucky for Ammi that he was not more 3
imaginative. Even as things were, his mind was bent ever so slightly; but had he 3
been able to connect and reflect upon all the portents around him he must 3
inevitably have turned a total maniac. In the twilight he hastened home, the 3
screams of the mad woman and the nervous child ringing horribly in his ears. 3
3
Three days later Nahum burst into Ammi's kitchen in the early morning, and in 3
the absence of his host stammered out a desperate tale once more, while Mrs. 3
Pierce listened in a clutching fright. It was little Merwin this time. He was gone. 3
He had gone out late at night with a lantern and pail for water, and had never 3
come back. He'd been going to pieces for days, and hardly knew what he was 3
about. Screamed at everything. There had been a frantic shriek from the yard 3
then, but before the father could get to the door the boy was gone. There was no 3
glow from the lantern he had taken, and of the child himself no trace. At the time 3
Nahum thought the lantern and pail were gone too; but when dawn came, and 3
the man had plodded back from his all-night search of the woods and fields, he 3
had found some very curious things near the well. There was a crushed and 3
apparently somewhat melted mass of iron which had certainly been the lantern; 3
while a bent handle and twisted iron hoops beside it, both half-fused, seemed to 3
hint at the remnants of the pail. That was all. Nahum was past imagining, Mrs. 3
Pierce was blank, and Ammi, when he had reached home and heard the tale, 3
could give no guess. Merwin was gone, and there would be no use in telling the 3
people around, who shunned all Gardners now. No use, either, in telling the city 3
3
3
3
415 3
3
3
3
people at Arkham who laughed at everything. Thad was gone, and now Merwin 3
was gone. Something was creeping and creeping and waiting to be seen and 3
heard. Nahum would go soon, and he wanted Ammi to look after his wife and 3
Zenas if they survived him. It must all be a judgment of some sort; though he 3
could not fancy what for, since he had always walked uprightly in the Lord's 3
ways so far as he knew. 3
3
For over two weeks Ammi saw nothing of Nahum; and then, worried about 3
what might have happened, he overcame his fears and paid the Gardner place a 3
visit. There was no smoke from the great chimney, and for a moment the visitor 3
was apprehensive of the worst. The aspect of the whole farm was shocking - 3
greyish withered grass and leaves on the ground, vines falling in brittle 3
wreckage from archaic walls and gables, and great bare trees clawing up at the 3
grey November sky with a studied malevolence which Ammi could not but feel 3
had come from some subtle change in the tilt of the branches. But Nahum was 3
alive, after all. He was weak, and lying on a couch in the low-ceiled kitchen, but 3
perfectly conscious and able to give simple orders to Zenas. The room was 3
deadly cold; and as Ammi visibly shivered, the host shouted huskily to Zenas for 3
more wood. Wood, indeed, was sorely needed; since the cavernous fireplace was 3
unlit and empty, with a cloud of soot blowing about in the chill wind that came 3
down the chimney. Presently Nahum asked him if the extra wood had made him 3
any more comfortable, and then Ammi saw what had happened. The stoutest 3
cord had broken at last, and the hapless farmer's mind was proof against more 3
sorrow. 3
3
Questioning tactfully, Ammi could get no clear data at all about the missing 3
Zenas. "In the well - he lives in the well - " was all that the clouded father would 3
say. Then there flashed across the visitor's mind a sudden thought of the mad 3
wife, and he changed his line of inquiry. "Nabby? Why, here she is!" was the 3
surprised response of poor Nahum, and Ammi soon saw that he must search for 3
himself. Leaving the harmless babbler on the couch, he took the keys from their 3
nail beside the door and climbed the creaking stairs to the attic. It was very close 3
and noisome up there, and no sound could be heard from any direction. Of the 3
four doors in sight, only one was locked, and on this he tried various keys of the 3
ring he had taken. The third key proved the right one, and after some fumbling 3
Ammi threw open the low white door. 3
3
It was quite dark inside, for the window was small and half-obscured by the 3
crude wooden bars; and Ammi could see nothing at all on the wide-planked 3
floor. The stench was beyond enduring, and before proceeding further he had to 3
retreat to another room and return with his lungs filled with breathable air. 3
When he did enter he saw something dark in the corner, and upon seeing it more 3
clearly he screamed outright. While he screamed he thought a momentary cloud 3
3
3
3
416 3
3
3
3
eclipsed the window, and a second later he felt himself brushed as if by some 3
hateful current of vapour. Strange colours danced before his eyes; and had not a 3
present horror numbed him he would have thought of the globule in the meteor 3
that the geologist's hammer had shattered, and of the morbid vegetation that had 3
sprouted in the spring. As it was he thought only of the blasphemous 3
monstrosity which confronted him, and which all too clearly had shared the 3
nameless fate of young Thaddeus and the livestock. But the terrible thing about 3
the horror was that it very slowly and perceptibly moved as it continued to 3
crumble. 3
3
Ammi would give me no added particulars of this scene, but the shape in the 3
comer does not reappear in his tale as a moving object. There are things which 3
cannot be mentioned, and what is done in common humanity is sometimes 3
cruelly judged by the law. I gathered that no moving thing was left in that attic 3
room, and that to leave anything capable of motion there would have been a 3
deed so monstrous as to damn any accountable being to eternal torment. Anyone 3
but a stolid farmer would have fainted or gone mad, but Ammi walked 3
conscious through that low doorway and locked the accursed secret behind him. 3
There would be Nahum to deal with now; he must be fed and tended, and 3
removed to some place where he could be cared for. 3
3
Commencing his descent of the dark stairs. Ammi heard a thud below him. He 3
even thought a scream had been suddenly choked off, and recalled nervously the 3
clammy vapour which had brushed by him in that frightful room above. What 3
presence had his cry and entry started up? Halted by some vague fear, he heard 3
still further sounds below. Indubitably there was a sort of heavy dragging, and a 3
most detestably sticky noise as of some fiendish and unclean species of suction. 3
With an associative sense goaded to feverish heights, he thought unaccountably 3
of what he had seen upstairs. Good God! What eldritch dream-world was this 3
into which he had blundered? He dared move neither backward nor forward, 3
but stood there trembling at the black curve of the boxed-in staircase. Every trifle 3
of the scene burned itself into his brain. The sounds, the sense of dread 3
expectancy, the darkness, the steepness of the narrow step - and merciful 3
Heaven! - the faint but unmistakable luminosity of all the woodwork in sight; 3
steps, sides, exposed laths, and beams alike. 3
3
Then there burst forth a frantic whinny from Ammi's horse outside, followed at 3
once by a clatter which told of a frenzied runaway. In another moment horse and 3
buggy had gone beyond earshot, leaving the frightened man on the dark stairs to 3
guess what had sent them. But that was not all. There had been another sound 3
out there. A sort of liquid splash - water - it must have been the well. He had left 3
Hero untied near it, and a buggy wheel must have brushed the coping and 3
knocked in a stone. And still the pale phosphorescence glowed in that detestably 3
3
3
3
417 3
3
3
3
ancient woodwork. God! how old the house was! Most of it buih before 1670, 3
and the gambrel roof no later than 1730. 3
3
A feeble scratching on the floor downstairs now sounded distinctly, and Ammi's 3
grip tightened on a heavy stick he had picked up in the attic for some purpose. 3
Slowly nerving himself, he finished his descent and walked boldly toward the 3
kitchen. But he did not complete the walk, because what he sought was no 3
longer there. It had come to meet him, and it was still alive after a fashion. 3
Whether it had crawled or whether it had been dragged by any external forces, 3
Ammi could not say; but the death had been at it. Everything had happened in 3
the last half-hour, but collapse, greying, and disintegration were already far 3
advanced. There was a horrible brittleness, and dry fragments were scaling off. 3
Ammi could not touch it, but looked horrifiedly into the distorted parody that 3
had been a face. "What was it, Nahum - what was it?" He whispered, and the 3
cleft, bulging lips were just able to crackle out a final answer. 3
3
"Nothin'... nothin'... the colour... it burns... cold an' wet, but it burns... it lived 3
in the well... I seen it... a kind of smoke... jest like the flowers last spring... the 3
well shone at night... Thad an' Merwin an' Zenas... everything alive... suckin' 3
the life out of everything... in that stone... it must a' come in that stone pizened 3
the whole place... dun't know what it wants... that round thing them men from 3
the college dug outen the stone. . . they smashed it. . . it was the same colour. . . jest 3
the same, like the flowers an' plants... must a' ben more of 'em... seeds... 3
seeds... they growed... I seen it the fust time this week... must a' got strong on 3
Zenas... he was a big boy, full o' life... it beats down your mind an' then gets 3
ye... burns ye up... in the well water... you was right about that... evil water... 3
Zenas never come back from the well... can't git away... draws ye... ye know 3
summ'at's comin' but tain't no use... I seen it time an' agin senct Zenas was 3
took... whar's Nabby, Ammi?... my head's no good... dun't know how long 3
sense I fed her. . . it'll git her ef we ain't keerful. . . jest a colour. . . her face is gittin' 3
to hev that colour sometimes towards night... an' it burns an' sucks... it come 3
from some place whar things ain't as they is here... one o' them professors said 3
so. . . he was right. . . look out, Ammi, it'll do suthin' more. . . sucks the life out. . ." 3
3
But that was all. That which spoke could speak no more because it had 3
completely caved in. Ammi laid a red checked tablecloth over what was left and 3
reeled out the back door into the fields. He climbed the slope to the ten-acre 3
pasture and stumbled home by the north road and the woods. He could not pass 3
that well from which his horses had run away. He had looked at it through the 3
window, and had seen that no stone was missing from the rim. Then the lurching 3
buggy had not dislodged anything after all - the splash had been something else - 3
something which went into the well after it had done with poor Nahum. 3
3
3
3
418 3
3
3
3
When Ammi reached his house the horses and buggy had arrived before him 3
and thrown his wife into fits of anxiety. Reassuring her without explanations, he 3
set out at once for Arkham and notified the authorities that the Gardner family 3
was no more. He indulged in no details, but merely told of the deaths of Nahum 3
and Nabby, that of Thaddeus being already known, and mentioned that the 3
cause seemed to be the same strange ailment which had killed the live-stock. He 3
also stated that Merwin and Zenas had disappeared. There was considerable 3
questioning at the police station, and in the end Ammi was compelled to take 3
three officers to the Gardner farm, together with the coroner, the medical 3
examiner, and the veterinary who had treated the diseased animals. He went 3
much against his will, for the afternoon was advancing and he feared the fall of 3
night over that accursed place, but it was some comfort to have so many people 3
with him. 3
3
The six men drove out in a democrat-wagon, following Ammi's buggy, and 3
arrived at the pest-ridden farmhouse about four o'clock. Used as the officers 3
were to gruesome experiences, not one remained unmoved at what was found in 3
the attic and under the red checked tablecloth on the floor below. The whole 3
aspect of the farm with its grey desolation was terrible enough, but those two 3
crumbling objects were beyond all bounds. No one could look long at them, and 3
even the medical examiner admitted that there was very little to examine. 3
Specimens could be analysed, of course, so he busied himself in obtaining them - 3
and here it develops that a very puzzling aftermath occurred at the college 3
laboratory where the two phials of dust were finally taken. Under the 3
spectroscope both samples gave off an unknown spectrum, in which many of the 3
baffling bands were precisely like those which the strange meteor had yielded in 3
the previous year. The property of emitting this spectrum vanished in a month, 3
the dust thereafter consisting mainly of alkaline phosphates and carbonates. 3
3
Ammi would not have told the men about the well if he had thought they meant 3
to do anything then and there. It was getting toward sunset, and he was anxious 3
to be away. But he could not help glancing nervously at the stony curb by the 3
great sweep, and when a detective questioned him he admitted that Nahum had 3
feared something down there so much so that he had never even thought of 3
searching it for Merwin or Zenas. After that nothing would do but that they 3
empty and explore the well immediately, so Ammi had to wait trembling while 3
pail after pail of rank water was hauled up and splashed on the soaking ground 3
outside. The men sniffed in disgust at the fluid, and toward the last held their 3
noses against the foetor they were uncovering. It was not so long a job as they 3
had feared it would be, since the water was phenomenally low. There is no need 3
to speak too exactly of what they found. Merwin and Zenas were both there, in 3
part, though the vestiges were mainly skeletal. There were also a small deer and 3
a large dog in about the same state, and a number of bones of small animals. The 3
3
3
3
419 3
3
3
3
ooze and slime at the bottom seemed inexplicably porous and bubbling, and a 3
man who descended on hand-holds with a long pole found that he could sink the 3
wooden shaft to any depth in the mud of the floor without meeting any solid 3
obstruction. 3
3
Twilight had now fallen, and lanterns were brought from the house. Then, when 3
it was seen that nothing further could be gained from the well, everyone went 3
indoors and conferred in the ancient sitting-room while the intermittent light of a 3
spectral half-moon played wanly on the grey desolation outside. The men were 3
frankly nonplussed by the entire case, and could find no convincing common 3
element to link the strange vegetable conditions, the unknown disease of live- 3
stock and humans, and the unaccountable deaths of Merwin and Zenas in the 3
tainted well. They had heard the common country talk, it is true; but could not 3
believe that anything contrary to natural law had occurred. No doubt the meteor 3
had poisoned the soil, but the illness of persons and animals who had eaten 3
nothing grown in that soil was another matter. Was it the well water? Very 3
possibly. It might be a good idea to analyze it. But what peculiar madness could 3
have made both boys jump into the well? Their deeds were so similar-and the 3
fragments showed that they had both suffered from the grey brittle death. Why 3
was everything so grey and brittle? 3
3
It was the coroner, seated near a window overlooking the yard, who first noticed 3
the glow about the well. Night had fully set in, and all the abhorrent grounds 3
seemed faintly luminous with more than the fitful moonbeams; but this new 3
glow was something definite and distinct, and appeared to shoot up from the 3
black pit like a softened ray from a searchlight, giving dull reflections in the little 3
ground pools where the water had been emptied. It had a very queer colour, and 3
as all the men clustered round the window Ammi gave a violent start. For this 3
strange beam of ghastly miasma was to him of no unfamiliar hue. He had seen 3
that colour before, and feared to think what it might mean. He had seen it in the 3
nasty brittle globule in that aerolite two summers ago, had seen it in the crazy 3
vegetation of the springtime, and had thought he had seen it for an instant that 3
very morning against the small barred window of that terrible attic room where 3
nameless things had happened. It had flashed there a second, and a clammy and 3
hateful current of vapour had brushed past him - and then poor Nahum had 3
been taken by something of that colour. He had said so at the last - said it was 3
like the globule and the plants. After that had come the runaway in the yard and 3
the splash in the well-and now that well was belching forth to the night a pale 3
insidious beam of the same demoniac tint. 3
3
It does credit to the alertness of Ammi's mind that he puzzled even at that tense 3
moment over a point which was essentially scientific. He could not but wonder 3
at his gleaning of the same impression from a vapour glimpsed in the daytime. 3
3
3
3
420 3
3
3
3
against a window opening on the morning sky, and from a nocturnal exhalation 3
seen as a phosphorescent mist against the black and blasted landscape. It wasn't 3
right - it was against Nature - and he thought of those terrible last words of his 3
stricken friend, "It come from some place whar things ain't as they is here... one 3
o' them professors said so..." 3
3
All three horses outside, tied to a pair of shrivelled saplings by the road, were 3
now neighing and pawing frantically. The wagon driver started for the door to 3
do something, but Ammi laid a shaky hand on his shoulder. "Dun't go out thar," 3
he whispered. "They's more to this nor what we know. Nahum said somethin' 3
lived in the well that sucks your life out. He said it must be some'at growed from 3
a round ball like one we all seen in the meteor stone that fell a year ago June. 3
Sucks an' burns, he said, an' is jest a cloud of colour like that light out thar now, 3
that ye can hardly see an' can't tell what it is. Nahum thought it feeds on 3
everything livin' an' gits stronger all the time. He said he seen it this last week. It 3
must be somethin' from away off in the sky like the men from the college last 3
year says the meteor stone was. The way it's made an' the way it works ain't like 3
no way 0' God's world. It's some'at from beyond." 3
3
So the men paused indecisively as the light from the well grew stronger and the 3
hitched horses pawed and whinnied in increasing frenzy. It was truly an awful 3
moment; with terror in that ancient and accursed house itself, four monstrous 3
sets of fragments-two from the house and two from the well-in the woodshed 3
behind, and that shaft of unknown and unholy iridescence from the slimy depths 3
in front. Ammi had restrained the driver on impulse, forgetting how uninjured 3
he himself was after the clammy brushing of that coloured vapour in the attic 3
room, but perhaps it is just as well that he acted as he did. No one will ever know 3
what was abroad that night; and though the blasphemy from beyond had not so 3
far hurt any human of unweakened mind, there is no telling what it might not 3
have done at that last moment, and with its seemingly increased strength and the 3
special signs of purpose it was soon to display beneath the half-clouded moonlit 3
sky. 3
3
All at once one of the detectives at the window gave a short, sharp gasp. The 3
others looked at him, and then quickly followed his own gaze upward to the 3
point at which its idle straying had been suddenly arrested. There was no need 3
for words. What had been disputed in country gossip was disputable no longer, 3
and it is because of the thing which every man of that party agreed in whispering 3
later on, that the strange days are never talked about in Arkham. It is necessary 3
to premise that there was no wind at that hour of the evening. One did arise not 3
long afterward, but there was absolutely none then. Even the dry tips of the 3
lingering hedge-mustard, grey and blighted, and the fringe on the roof of the 3
standing democrat-wagon were unstirred. And yet amid that tense godless calm 3
3
3
3
421 3
3
3
3
the high bare boughs of all the trees in the yard were moving. They were 3
twitching morbidly and spasmodically, clawing in convulsive and epileptic 3
madness at the moonlit clouds; scratching impotently in the noxious air as if 3
jerked by some allied and bodiless line of linkage with subterrene horrors 3
writhing and struggling below the black roots. 3
3
Not a man breathed for several seconds. Then a cloud of darker depth passed 3
over the moon, and the silhouette of clutching branches faded out momentarily. 3
At this there was a general cry; muffled with awe, but husky and almost identical 3
from every throat. For the terror had not faded with the silhouette, and in a 3
fearsome instant of deeper darkness the watchers saw wriggling at that tree top 3
height a thousand tiny points of faint and unhallowed radiance, tipping each 3
bough like the fire of St. Elmo or the flames that come down on the apostles' 3
heads at Pentecost. It was a monstrous constellation of unnatural light, like a 3
glutted swarm of corpse-fed fireflies dancing hellish sarabands over an accursed 3
marsh, and its colour was that same nameless intrusion which Ammi had come 3
to recognize and dread. All the while the shaft of phosphorescence from the well 3
was getting brighter and brighter, bringing to the minds of the huddled men, a 3
sense of doom and abnormality which far outraced any image their conscious 3
minds could form. It was no longer shining out; it was pouring out; and as the 3
shapeless stream of unplaceable colour left the well it seemed to flow directly 3
into the sky. 3
3
The veterinary shivered, and walked to the front door to drop the heavy extra 3
bar across it. Ammi shook no less, and had to tug and point for lack of 3
controllable voice when he wished to draw notice to the growing luminosity of 3
the trees. The neighing and stamping of the horses had become utterly frightful, 3
but not a soul of that group in the old house would have ventured forth for any 3
earthly reward. With the moments the shining of the trees increased, while their 3
restless branches seemed to strain more and more toward verticality. The wood 3
of the well-sweep was shining now, and presently a policeman dumbly pointed 3
to some wooden sheds and bee-hives near the stone wall on the west. They were 3
commencing to shine, too, though the tethered vehicles of the visitors seemed so 3
far unaffected. Then there was a wild commotion and clopping in the road, and 3
as Ammi quenched the lamp for better seeing they realized that the span of 3
frantic greys had broken their sapling and run off with the democrat-wagon. 3
3
The shock served to loosen several tongues, and embarrassed whispers were 3
exchanged. "It spreads on everything organic that's been around here," muttered 3
the medical examiner. No one replied, but the man who had been in the well 3
gave a hint that his long pole must have stirred up something intangible. "It was 3
awful," he added. "There was no bottom at all. Just ooze and bubbles and the 3
feeling of something lurking under there." Ammi's horse still pawed and 3
3
3
3
422 3
3
3
3
screamed deafeningly in the road outside, and nearly drowned its owner's faint 3
quaver as he mumbled his formless reflections. "It come from that stone - it 3
growed down thar - it got everything livin' - it fed itself on 'em, mind and body - 3
Thad an' Merwin, Zenas an' Nabby - Nahum was the last - they all drunk the 3
water - it got strong on 'em - it come from beyond, whar things ain't like they be 3
here - now it's goin' home -" 3
3
At this point, as the column of unknown colour flared suddenly stronger and 3
began to weave itself into fantastic suggestions of shape which each spectator 3
described differently, there came from poor tethered Hero such a sound as no 3
man before or since ever heard from a horse. Every person in that low-pitched 3
sitting room stopped his ears, and Ammi turned away from the window in 3
horror and nausea. Words could not convey it - when Ammi looked out again 3
the hapless beast lay huddled inert on the moonlit ground between the 3
splintered shafts of the buggy. That was the last of Hero till they buried him next 3
day. But the present was no time to mourn, for almost at this instant a detective 3
silently called attention to something terrible in the very room with them. In the 3
absence of the lamplight it was clear that a faint phosphorescence had begun to 3
pervade the entire apartment. It glowed on the broad-planked floor and the 3
fragment of rag carpet, and shimmered over the sashes of the small-paned 3
windows. It ran up and down the exposed corner-posts, coruscated about the 3
shelf and mantel, and infected the very doors and furniture. Each minute saw it 3
strengthen, and at last it was very plain that healthy living things must leave that 3
house. 3
3
Ammi showed them the back door and the path up through the fields to the ten- 3
acre pasture. They walked and stumbled as in a dream, and did not dare look 3
back till they were far away on the high ground. They were glad of the path, for 3
they could not have gone the front way, by that well. It was bad enough passing 3
the glowing barn and sheds, and those shining orchard trees with their gnarled, 3
fiendish contours; but thank Heaven the branches did their worst twisting high 3
up. The moon went under some very black clouds as they crossed the rustic 3
bridge over Chapman's Brook, and it was blind groping from there to the open 3
meadows. 3
3
When they looked back toward the valley and the distant Gardner place at the 3
bottom they saw a fearsome sight. At the farm was shining with the hideous 3
unknown blend of colour; trees, buildings, and even such grass and herbage as 3
had not been wholly changed to lethal grey brittleness. The boughs were all 3
straining skyward, tipped with tongues of foul flame, and lambent tricklings of 3
the same monstrous fire were creeping about the ridgepoles of the house, barn 3
and sheds. It was a scene from a vision of Fuseli, and over all the rest reigned 3
that riot of luminous amorphousness, that alien and undimensioned rainbow of 3
3
3
3
423 3
3
3
3
cryptic poison from the well - seething, feeling, lapping, reaching, scintillating, 3
straining, and malignly bubbling in its cosmic and unrecognizable chromaticism. 3
3
Then without warning the hideous thing shot vertically up toward the sky like a 3
rocket or meteor, leaving behind no trail and disappearing through a round and 3
curiously regular hole in the clouds before any man could gasp or cry out. No 3
watcher can ever forget that sight, and Ammi stared blankly at the stars of 3
Cygnus, Deneb twinkling above the others, where the unknown colour had 3
melted into the Milky Way. But his gaze was the next moment called swiftly to 3
earth by the crackling in the valley. It was just that. Only a wooden ripping and 3
crackling, and not an explosion, as so many others of the party vowed. Yet the 3
outcome was the same, for in one feverish kaleidoscopic instant there burst up 3
from that doomed and accursed farm a gleamingly eruptive cataclysm of 3
unnatural sparks and substance; blurring the glance of the few who saw it, and 3
sending forth to the zenith a bombarding cloudburst of such coloured and 3
fantastic fragments as our universe must needs disown. Through quickly 3
reclosing vapours they followed the great morbidity that had vanished, and in 3
another second they had vanished too. Behind and below was only a darkness to 3
which the men dared not return, and all about was a mounting wind which 3
seemed to sweep down in black, frore gusts from interstellar space. It shrieked 3
and howled, and lashed the fields and distorted woods in a mad cosmic frenzy, 3
till soon the trembling party realized it would be no use waiting for the moon to 3
show what was left down there at Nahum's. 3
3
Too awed even to hint theories, the seven shaking men trudged back toward 3
Arkham by the north road. Ammi was worse than his fellows, and begged them 3
to see him inside his own kitchen, instead of keeping straight on to town. He did 3
not wish to cross the blighted, wind-whipped woods alone to his home on the 3
main road. For he had had an added shock that the others were spared, and was 3
crushed forever with a brooding fear he dared not even mention for many years 3
to come. As the rest of the watchers on that tempestuous hill had stolidly set 3
their faces toward the road, Ammi had looked back an instant at the shadowed 3
valley of desolation so lately sheltering his ill-starred friend. And from that 3
stricken, far-away spot he had seen something feebly rise, only to sink down 3
again upon the place from which the great shapeless horror had shot into the 3
sky. It was just a colour - but not any colour of our earth or heavens. And 3
because Ammi recognized that colour, and knew that this last faint remnant 3
must still lurk down there in the well, he has never been quite right since. 3
3
Ammi would never go near the place again. It is forty-four years now since the 3
horror happened, but he has never been there, and will be glad when the new 3
reservoir blots it out. I shall be glad, too, for I do not like the way the sunlight 3
changed colour around the mouth of that abandoned well I passed. I hope the 3
3
3
3
424 3
3
3
3
water will always be very deep - but even so, I shall never drink it. I do not think 3
I shall visit the Arkham country hereafter. Three of the men who had been with 3
Ammi returned the next morning to see the ruins by daylight, but there were not 3
any real ruins. Only the bricks of the chimney, the stones of the cellar, some 3
mineral and metallic litter here and there, and the rim of that nefandous well. 3
Save for Ammi's dead horse, which they towed away and buried, and the buggy 3
which they shortly returned to him, everything that had ever been living had 3
gone. Five eldritch acres of dusty grey desert remained, nor has anything ever 3
grown there since. To this day it sprawls open to the sky like a great spot eaten 3
by acid in the woods and fields, and the few who have ever dared glimpse it in 3
spite of the rural tales have named it "the blasted heath." 3
3
The rural tales are queer. They might be even queerer if city men and college 3
chemists could be interested enough to analyze the water from that disused well, 3
or the grey dust that no wind seems to disperse. Botanists, too, ought to study 3
the stunted flora on the borders of that spot, for they might shed light on the 3
country notion that the blight is spreading - little by little, perhaps an inch a year. 3
People say the colour of the neighboring herbage is not quite right in the spring, 3
and that wild things leave queer prints in the light winter snow. Snow never 3
seems quite so heavy on the blasted heath as it is elsewhere. Horses - the few that 3
are left in this motor age - grow skittish in the silent valley; and hunters cannot 3
depend on their dogs too near the splotch of greyish dust. 3
3
They say the mental influences are very bad, too; numbers went queer in the 3
years after Nahum's taking, and always they lacked the power to get away. Then 3
the stronger-minded folk all left the region, and only the foreigners tried to live 3
in the crumbling old homesteads. They could not stay, though; and one 3
sometimes wonders what insight beyond ours their wild, weird stories of 3
whispered magic have given them. Their dreams at night, they protest, are very 3
horrible in that grotesque country; and surely the very look of the dark realm is 3
enough to stir a morbid fancy. No traveler has ever escaped a sense of 3
strangeness in those deep ravines, and artists shiver as they paint thick woods 3
whose mystery is as much of the spirits as of the eye. I myself am curious about 3
the sensation I derived from my one lone walk before Ammi told me his tale. 3
When twilight came I had vaguely wished some clouds would gather, for an odd 3
timidity about the deep skyey voids above had crept into my soul. 3
3
Do not ask me for my opinion. I do not know - that is all. There was no one but 3
Ammi to question; for Arkham people will not talk about the strange days, and 3
all three professors who saw the aerolite and its coloured globule are dead. There 3
were other globules - depend upon that. One must have fed itself and escaped, 3
and probably there was another which was too late. No doubt it is still down the 3
well - I know there was something wrong with the sunlight I saw above the 3
3
3
3
425 3
3
3
3
miasmal brink. The rustics say the bhght creeps an inch a year, so perhaps there 3
is a kind of growth or nourishment even now. But whatever demon hatchhng is 3
there, it must be tethered to something or else it would quickly spread. Is it 3
fastened to the roots of those trees that claw the air? One of the current Arkham 3
tales is about fat oaks that shine and move as they ought not to do at night. 3
3
What it is, only God knows. In terms of matter I suppose the thing Ammi 3
described would be called a gas, but this gas obeyed the laws that are not of our 3
cosmos. This was no fruit of such worlds and suns as shine on the telescopes and 3
photographic plates of our observatories. This was no breath from the skies 3
whose motions and dimensions our astronomers measure or deem too vast to 3
measure. It was just a colour out of space - a frightful messenger from unformed 3
realms of infinity beyond all Nature as we know it; from realms whose mere 3
existence stuns the brain and numbs us with the black extra-cosmic gulfs it 3
throws open before our frenzied eyes. 3
3
I doubt very much if Ammi consciously lied to me, and I do not think his tale 3
was all a freak of madness as the townsfolk had forewarned. Something terrible 3
came to the hills and valleys on that meteor, and something terrible - though I 3
know not in what proportion - still remains. I shall be glad to see the water come. 3
Meanwhile I hope nothing will happen to Ammi. He saw so much of the thing - 3
and its influence was so insidious. Why has he never been able to move away? 3
How clearly he recalled those dying words of Nahum's - "Can't git away - draws 3
ye - ye know summ'at's comin' but tain't no use - ". Ammi is such a good old 3
man - when the reservoir gang gets to work I must write the chief engineer to 3
keep a sharp watch on him. I would hate to think of him as the grey, twisted, 3
brittle monstrosity which persists more and more in troubling my sleep. 3

Writing on what my doctor tells me is my deathbed, my most hideous fear is that 3
the man is wrong. I suppose I shall seem to be buried next week, but. . . 3
3
In London there is a man who screams when the church bells ring. He lives all 3
alone with his streaked cat in Gray's Inn, and people call him harmlessly mad. 3
His room is filled with books of the tamest and most puerile kind, and hour after 3
hour he tries to lose himself in their feeble pages. All he seeks from life is not to 3
think. For some reason thought is very horrible to him, and anything which stirs 3
the imagination he flees as a plague. He is very thin and grey and wrinkled, but 3
there are those who declare he is not nearly so old as he looks. Fear has its grisly 3
claws upon him, and a sound will make him start with staring eyes and sweat- 3
beaded forehead. Friends and companions he shuns, for he wishes to answer no 3
questions. Those who once knew him as scholar and aesthete say it is very pitiful 3
to see him now. He dropped them all years ago, and no one feels sure whether 3
he left the country or merely sank from sight in some hidden byway. It is a 3
decade now since he moved into Gray's Inn, and of where he had been he would 3
say nothing till the night young Williams bought the Necronomicon. 3
3
Williams was a dreamer, and only twenty-three, and when he moved into the 3
ancient house he felt a strangeness and a breath of cosmic wind about the grey 3
wizened man in the next room. He forced his friendship where old friends dared 3
not force theirs, and marvelled at the fright that sat upon this gaunt, haggard 3
watcher and listener. For that the man always watched and listened no one could 3
doubt. He watched and listened with his mind more than with his eyes and ears, 3
and strove every moment to drown something in his ceaseless poring over gay, 3
insipid novels. And when the church bells rang he would stop his ears and 3
scream, and the grey cat that dwelt with him would howl in unison till the last 3
peal died reverberantly away. 3
3
But try as Williams would, he could not make his neighbour speak of anything 3
profound or hidden. The old man would not live up to his aspect and manner, 3
but would feign a smile and a light tone and prattle feverishly and frantically of 3
cheerful trifles; his voice every moment rising and thickening till at last it would 3
split in a piping and incoherent falsetto. That his learning was deep and 3
thorough, his most trivial remarks made abundantly clear; and Williams was not 3
surprised to hear that he had been to Harrow and Oxford. Later it developed that 3
3
3
3
427 3
3
3
3
he was none other than Lord Northam, of whose ancient hereditary castle on the 3
Yorkshire coast so many odd things were told; but when Williams tried to talk of 3
the castle, and of its reputed Roman origin, he refused to admit that there was 3
anything unusual about it. He even tittered shrilly when the subject of the 3
supposed under crypts, hewn out of the solid crag that frowns on the North Sea, 3
was brought up. 3
3
So matters went till that night when Williams brought home the infamous 3
Necronomicon of the mad Arab Abdul Alhazred. He had known of the dreaded 3
volume since his sixteenth year, when his dawning love of the bizarre had led 3
him to ask queer questions of a bent old bookseller in Chandos Street; and he had 3
always wondered why men paled when they spoke of it. The old bookseller had 3
told him that only five copies were known to have survived the shocked edicts of 3
the priests and lawgivers against it and that all of these were locked up with 3
frightened care by custodians who had ventured to begin a reading of the hateful 3
black-letter. But now, at last, he had not only found an accessible copy but had 3
made it his own at a ludicrously low figure. It was at a Jew's shop in the squalid 3
precincts of Clare Market, where he had often bought strange things before, and 3
he almost fancied the gnarled old Levite smiled amidst tangles of beard as the 3
great discovery was made. The bulky leather cover with the brass clasp had been 3
so prominently visible, and the price was so absurdly slight. 3
3
The one glimpse he had had of the title was enough to send him into transports, 3
and some of the diagrams set in the vague Latin text excited the tensest and most 3
disquieting recollections in his brain. He felt it was highly necessary to get the 3
ponderous thing home and begin deciphering it, and bore it out of the shop with 3
such precipitate haste that the old Jew chuckled disturbingly behind him. But 3
when at last it was safe in his room he found the combination of black-letter and 3
debased idiom too much for his powers as a linguist, and reluctantly called on 3
his strange, frightened friend for help with the twisted, mediaeval Latin. Lord 3
Northam was simpering inanities to his streaked cat, and started violently when 3
the young man entered. Then he saw the volume and shuddered wildly, and 3
fainted altogether when Williams uttered the title. It was when he regained his 3
senses that he told his story; told his fantastic figment of madness in frantic 3
whispers, lest his friend be not quick to burn the accursed book and give wide 3
scattering to its ashes. 3
3
3
3
* * * * 3
3
3
3
There must. Lord Northam whispered, have been something wrong at the start; 3
but it would never have come to a head if he had not explored too far. He was 3
the nineteenth Baron of a line whose beginings went uncomfortably far back into 3
the past- unbelievably far, if vague tradition could be heeded, for there were 3
3
3
3
428 3
3
3
3
family tales of a descent from pre-Saxon times, when a certain Lunaeus Gabinius 3
Capito, military tribune in the Third Augustan Legion then stationed at Lindum 3
in Roman Britain, had been summarily expelled from his command for 3
participation in certain rites unconnected with any known religion. Gabinius 3
had, the rumour ran, come upon a cliffside cavern where strange folk met 3
together and made the Elder Sign in the dark; strange folk whom the Britons 3
knew not save in fear, and who were the last to survive from a great land in the 3
west that had sunk, leaving only the islands with the roths and circles and 3
shrines of which Stonehenge was the greatest. There was no certainty, of course, 3
in the legend that Gabinius had built an impregnable fortress over the forbidden 3
cave and founded a line which Pict and Saxon, Dane and Norman were 3
powerless to obliterate; or in the tacit assumption that from this line sprang the 3
bold companion and lieutenant of the Black Prince whom Edward Third created 3
Baron of Northam. These things were not certain, yet they were often told; and in 3
truth the stonework of Northam Keep did look alarmingly like the masonry of 3
Hadrian's Wall. As a child Lord Northam had had peculiar dreams when 3
sleeping in the older parts of the castle, and had acquired a constant habit of 3
looking back through his memory for half-amorphous scenes and patterns and 3
impressions which formed no part of his waking experience. He became a 3
dreamer who found life tame and unsatisfying; a searcher for strange realms and 3
relationships once familiar, yet lying nowhere in the visible regions of earth. 3
3
Filled with a feeling that our tangible world is only an atom in a fabric vast and 3
ominous, and that unknown demesnes press on and permeate the sphere of the 3
known at every point, Northam in youth and young manhood drained in turn 3
the founts of formal religion and occult mystery. Nowhere, however, could he 3
find ease and content; and as he grew older the staleness and limitations of life 3
became more and more maddening to him. During the 'nineties he dabbled in 3
Satanism, and at all times he devoured avidly any doctrine or theory which 3
seemed to promise escape from the close vistas of science and the dully 3
unvarying laws of Nature. Books like Ignatius Donnelly's commerical account of 3
Atlantis he absorbed with zest, and a dozen obscure precursors of Charles Fort 3
enthralled him with their vagaries. He would travel leagues to follow up a 3
furtive village tale of abnormal wonder, and once went into the desert of Araby 3
to seek a Nameless City of faint report, which no man has ever beheld. There 3
rose within him the tantalising faith that somewhere an easy gate existed, which 3
if one found would admit him freely to those outer deeps whose echoes rattled 3
so dimly at the back of his memory. It might be in the visible world, yet it might 3
be only in his mind and soul. Perhaps he held within his own half-explored brain 3
that cryptic link which would awaken him to elder and future lives in forgotten 3
dimensions; which would bind him to the stars, and to the infinities and 3
eternities beyond them. 3

The Doom That Came to Sarnath 3
3
Written on December 3, 1919 3
3
Published June 1920 in The Scot 3
3
There is in the land of Mnar a vast still lake that is fed by no stream, and out of 3
which no stream flows. Ten thousand years ago there stood by its shore the 3
mighty city of Sarnath, but Sarnath stands there no more. 3
3
It is told that in the immemorial years when the world was young, before ever 3
the men of Sarnath came to the land of Mnar, another city stood beside the lake; 3
the gray stone city of lb, which was old as the lake itself, and peopled with 3
beings not pleasing to behold. Very odd and ugly were these beings, as indeed 3
are most beings of a world yet inchoate and rudely fashioned. It is written on the 3
brick cylinders of Kadatheron that the beings of lb were in hue as green as the 3
lake and the mists that rise above it; that they had bulging eyes, pouting, flabby 3
lips, and curious ears, and were without voice. It is also written that they 3
descended one night from the moon in a mist; they and the vast still lake and 3
gray stone city lb. However this may be, it is certain that they worshipped a sea- 3
green stone idol chiseled in the likeness of Bokrug, the great water-lizard; before 3
which they danced horribly when the moon was gibbous. And it is written in the 3
papyrus of Ilarnek, that they one day discovered fire, and thereafter kindled 3
flames on many ceremonial occasions. But not much is written of these beings, 3
because they lived in very ancient times, and man is young, and knows but little 3
of the very ancient living things. 3
3
After many eons men came to the land of Mnar, dark shepherd folk with their 3
fleecy flocks, who built Thraa, Ilarnek, and Kadatheron on the winding river Ai. 3
And certain tribes, more hardy than the rest, pushed on to the border of the lake 3
and built Sarnath at a spot where precious metals were found in the earth. 3
3
Not far from the gray city of lb did the wandering tribes lay the first stones of 3
Sarnath, and at the beings of lb they marveled greatly. But with their marveling 3
was mixed hate, for they thought it not meet that beings of such aspect should 3
walk about the world of men at dusk. Nor did they like the strange sculptures 3
upon the gray monoliths of lb, for why those sculptures lingered so late in the 3
world, even until the coming men, none can tell; unless it was because the land 3
of Mnar is very still, and remote from most other lands, both of waking and of 3
dream. 3
3

3
3
3
As the men of Sarnath beheld more of the beings of lb their hate grew, and it was 3
not less because they found the beings weak, and soft as jelly to the touch of 3
stones and arrows. So one day the young warriors, the slingers and the spearmen 3
and the bowmen, marched against lb and slew all the inhabitants thereof, 3
pushing the queer bodies into the lake with long spears, because they did not 3
wish to touch them. And because they did not like the gray sculptured monoliths 3
of lb they cast these also into the lake; wondering from the greatness of the labor 3
how ever the stones were brought from afar, as they must have been, since there 3
is naught like them in the land of Mnar or in the lands adjacent. 3
3
Thus of the very ancient city of lb was nothing spared, save the sea-green stone 3
idol chiseled in the likeness of Bokrug, the water-lizard. This the young warriors 3
took back with them as a symbol of conquest over the old gods and beings of Th, 3
and as a sign of leadership in Mnar. But on the night after it was set up in the 3
temple, a terrible thing must have happened, for weird lights were seen over the 3
lake, and in the morning the people found the idol gone and the high-priest 3
Taran-Ish lying dead, as from some fear unspeakable. And before he died, Taran- 3
Ish had scrawled upon the altar of chrysolite with coarse shaky strokes the sign 3
of DOOM. 3
3
After Taran-Ish there were many high-priests in Sarnath but never was the sea- 3
green stone idol found. And many centuries came and went, wherein Sarnath 3
prospered exceedingly, so that only priests and old women remembered what 3
Taran-Ish had scrawled upon the altar of chrysolite. Betwixt Sarnath and the city 3
of Ilarnek arose a caravan route, and the precious metals from the earth were 3
exchanged for other metals and rare cloths and jewels and books and tools for 3
artificers and all things of luxury that are known to the people who dwell along 3
the winding river Ai and beyond. So Sarnath waxed mighty and learned and 3
beautiful, and sent forth conquering armies to subdue the neighboring cities; and 3
in time there sate upon a throne in Sarnath the kings of all the land of Mnar and 3
of many lands adjacent. 3
3
The wonder of the world and the pride of all mankind was Sarnath the 3
magnificent. Of polished desert-quarried marble were its walls, in height three 3
hundred cubits and in breadth seventy-five, so that chariots might pass each 3
other as men drove them along the top. For full five hundred stadia did they run, 3
being open only on the side toward the lake where a green stone sea-wall kept 3
back the waves that rose oddly once a year at the festival of the destroying of lb. 3
In Sarnath were fifty streets from the lake to the gates of the caravans, and fifty 3
more intersecting them. With onyx were they paved, save those whereon the 3
horses and camels and elephants trod, which were paved with granite. And the 3
gates of Sarnath were as many as the landward ends of the streets, each of 3
bronze, and flanked by the figures of lions and elephants carven from some stone 3
3

3
no longer known among men. The houses of Sarnath were of glazed brick and 3
chalcedony, each having its walled garden and crystal lakelet. With strange art 3
were they builded, for no other city had houses like them; and travelers from 3
Thraa and Ilarnek and Kadatheron marveled at the shining domes wherewith 3
they were surmounted. 3
3
But more marvelous still were the palaces and the temples, and the gardens 3
made by Zokkar the olden king. There were many palaces, the last of which were 3
mightier than any in Thraa or Ilarnek or Kadatheron. So high were they that one 3
within might sometimes fancy himself beneath only the sky; yet when lighted 3
with torches dipt in the oil of Dother their walls showed vast paintings of kings 3
and armies, of a splendor at once inspiring and stupefying to the beholder. Many 3
were the pillars of the palaces, all of tinted marble, and carven into designs of 3
surpassing beauty. And in most of the palaces the floors were mosaics of beryl 3
and lapis lazuli and sardonyx and carbuncle and other choice materials, so 3
disposed that the beholder might fancy himself walking over beds of the rarest 3
flowers. And there were likewise fountains, which cast scented waters about in 3
pleasing jets arranged with cunning art. Outshining all others was the palace of 3
the kings of Mnar and of the lands adjacent. On a pair of golden crouching lions 3
rested the throne, many steps above the gleaming floor. And it was wrought of 3
one piece of ivory, though no man lives who knows whence so vast a piece could 3
have come. In that palace there were also many galleries, and many 3
amphitheaters where lions and men and elephants battled at the pleasure of the 3
kings. Sometimes the amphitheaters were flooded with water conveyed from the 3
lake in mighty aqueducts, and then were enacted stirring sea-fights, or combats 3
betwixt swimmers and deadly marine things. 3
3
Lofty and amazing were the seventeen tower-like temples of Sarnath, fashioned 3
of a bright multi-colored stone not known elsewhere. A full thousand cubits high 3
stood the greatest among them, wherein the high-priests dwelt with a 3
magnificence scarce less than that of the kings. On the ground were halls as vast 3
and splendid as those of the palaces; where gathered throngs in worship of Zo- 3
Kalar and Tamash and Lobon, the chief gods of Sarnath, whose incense- 3
enveloped shrines were as the thrones of monarchs. Not like the eikons of other 3
gods were those of Zo-Kalar and Tamash and Lobon. For so close to life were 3
they that one might swear the graceful bearded gods themselves sate on the 3
ivory thrones. And up unending steps of zircon was the tower-chamber, 3
wherefrom the high-priests looked out over the city and the plains and the lake 3
by day; and at the cryptic moon and significant stars and planets, and their 3
reflections in the lake, at night. Here was done the very secret and ancient rite in 3
detestation of Bokrug, the water-lizard, and here rested the altar of chrysolite 3
which bore the Doom-scrawl of Taran-Ish. 3
3
3
3
432 3
3
3
3
Wonderful likewise were the gardens made by Zokkar the olden king. In the 3
center of Sarnath they lay, covering a great space and encircled by a high wall. 3
And they were surmounted by a mighty dome of glass, through which shone the 3
sun and moon and planets when it was clear, and from which were hung fulgent 3
images of the sun and moon and stars and planets when it was not clear. In 3
summer the gardens were cooled with fresh odorous breezes skilfully wafted by 3
fans, and in winter they were heated with concealed fires, so that in those 3
gardens it was always spring. There ran little streams over bright pebbles, 3
dividing meads of green and gardens of many hues, and spanned by a multitude 3
of bridges. Many were the waterfalls in their courses, and many were the hued 3
lakelets into which they expanded. Over the streams and lakelets rode white 3
swans, whilst the music of rare birds chimed in with the melody of the waters. In 3
ordered terraces rose the green banks, adorned here and there with bowers of 3
vines and sweet blossoms, and seats and benches of marble and porphyry. And 3
there were many small shrines and temples where one might rest or pray to 3
small gods. 3
3
Each year there was celebrated in Sarnath the feast of the destroying of lb, at 3
which time wine, song, dancing, and merriment of every kind abounded. Great 3
honors were then paid to the shades of those who had annihilated the odd 3
ancient beings, and the memory of those beings and of their elder gods was 3
derided by dancers and lutanists crowned with roses from the gardens of 3
Zokkar. And the kings would look out over the lake and curse the bones of the 3
dead that lay beneath it. 3
3
At first the high-priests liked not these festivals, for there had descended 3
amongst them queer tales of how the sea-green eikon had vanished, and how 3
Taran-Ish had died from fear and left a warning. And they said that from their 3
high tower they sometimes saw lights beneath the waters of the lake. But as 3
many years passed without calamity even the priests laughed and cursed and 3
joined in the orgies of the feasters. Indeed, had they not themselves, in their high 3
tower, often performed the very ancient and secret rite in detestation of Bokrug, 3
the water-lizard? And a thousand years of riches and delight passed over 3
Sarnath, wonder of the world. 3
3
Gorgeous beyond thought was the feast of the thousandth year of the destroying 3
of lb. For a decade had it been talked of in the land of Mnar, and as it drew nigh 3
there came to Sarnath on horses and camels and elephants men from Thraa, 3
Ilarnek, and Kadetheron, and all the cities of Mnar and the lands beyond. Before 3
the marble walls on the appointed night were pitched the pavilions of princes 3
and the tents of travelers. Within his banquet-hall reclined Nargis-Hei, the king, 3
drunken with ancient wine from the vaults of conquered Pnoth, and surrounded 3
by feasting nobles and hurrying slaves. There were eaten many strange delicacies 3
3
3
3
433 3
3
3
3
at that feast; peacocks from the distant hills of Linplan, heels of camels from the 3
Bnazic desert, nuts and spices from Sydathrian groves, and pearls from wave- 3
washed Mtal dissolved in the vinegar of Thraa. Of sauces there were an untold 3
number, prepared by the subtlest cooks in all Mnar, and suited to the palate of 3
every feaster. But most prized of all the viands were the great fishes from the 3
lake, each of vast size, and served upon golden platters set with rubies and 3
diamonds. 3
3
Whilst the king and his nobles feasted within the palace, and viewed the 3
crowning dish as it awaited them on golden platters, others feasted elsewhere. In 3
the tower of the great temple the priests held revels, and in pavilions without the 3
walls the princes of neighboring lands made merry. And it was the high-priest 3
Gnai-Kah who first saw the shadows that descended from the gibbous moon into 3
the lake, and the damnable green mists that arose from the lake to meet the moon 3
and to shroud in a sinister haze the towers and the domes of fated Sarnath. 3
Thereafter those in the towers and without the walls beheld strange lights on the 3
water, and saw that the gray rock Akurion, which was wont to rear high above it 3
near the shore, was almost submerged. And fear grew vaguely yet swiftly, so 3
that the princes of Ilarnek and of far Rokol took down and folded their tents and 3
pavilions and departed, though they scarce knew the reason for their departing. 3
3
Then, close to the hour of midnight, all the bronze gates of Sarnath burst open 3
and emptied forth a frenzied throng that blackened the plain, so that all the 3
visiting princes and travelers fled away in fright. For on the faces of this throng 3
was writ a madness born of horror unendurable, and on their tongues were 3
words so terrible that no hearer paused for proof. Men whose eyes were wild 3
with fear shrieked aloud of the sight within the king's banquet-hall, where 3
through the windows were seen no longer the forms of Nargis-Hei and his 3
nobles and slaves, but a horde of indescribable green voiceless things with 3
bulging eyes, pouting, flabby lips, and curious ears; things which danced 3
horribly, bearing in their paws golden platters set with rubies and diamonds and 3
containing uncouth flames. And the princes and travelers, as they fled from the 3
doomed city of Sarnath on horses and camels and elephants, looked again upon 3
the mist-begetting lake and saw the gray rock Akurion was quite submerged. 3
Through all the land of Mnar and the land adjacent spread the tales of those who 3
had fled from Sarnath, and caravans sought that accursed city and its precious 3
metals no more. It was long ere any travelers went thither, and even then only 3
the brave and adventurous young men of yellow hair and blue eyes, who are no 3
kin to the men of Mnar. These men indeed went to the lake to view Sarnath; but 3
though they found the vast still lake itself, and the gray rock Akurion which 3
rears high above it near the shore, they beheld not the wonder of the world and 3
pride of all mankind. Where once had risen walls of three hundred cubits and 3
towers yet higher, now stretched only the marshy shore, and where once had 3
3
3
3
434 3
3
3
3
dwelt fifty million of men now crawled the detestable water-lizard. Not even the 3
mines of precious metal remained. DOOM had come to Sarnath. 3
3
But half buried in the rushes was spied a curious green idol; an exceedingly 3
ancient idol chiseled in the likeness of Bokrug, the great water-lizard. That idol, 3
enshrined in the high temple at Ilarnek, was subsequently worshipped beneath 3
the gibbous moon throughout the land of Mnar. 3

The Dream Quest of Unknown Kadath 3
3
Written in January of 1927 3
3
Published in Beyond the Wall of Sleep 3
3
Three times Randolph Carter dreamed of the marvelous city, and three times 3
was he snatched away while still he paused on the high terrace above it. All 3
golden and lovely it blazed in the sunset, with walls, temples, colonnades and 3
arched bridges of veined marble, silver-basined fountains of prismatic spray in 3
broad squares and perfumed gardens, and wide streets marching between 3
delicate trees and blossom-laden urns and ivory statues in gleaming rows; while 3
on steep northward slopes climbed tiers of red roofs and old peaked gables 3
harbouring little lanes of grassy cobbles. It was a fever of the gods, a fanfare of 3
supernal trumpets and a clash of immortal cymbals. Mystery hung about it as 3
clouds about a fabulous unvisited mountain; and as Carter stood breathless and 3
expectant on that balustraded parapet there swept up to him the poignancy and 3
suspense of almost-vanished memory, the pain of lost things and the maddening 3
need to place again what once had been an awesome and momentous place. 3
3
He knew that for him its meaning must once have been supreme; though in what 3
cycle or incarnation he had known it, or whether in dream or in waking, he could 3
not tell. Vaguely it called up glimpses of a far forgotten first youth, when wonder 3
and pleasure lay in all the mystery of days, and dawn and dusk alike strode forth 3
prophetic to the eager sound of lutes and song, unclosing fiery gates toward 3
further and surprising marvels. But each night as he stood on that high marble 3
terrace with the curious urns and carven rail and looked off over that hushed 3
sunset city of beauty and unearthly immanence he felt the bondage of dream's 3
tyrannous gods; for in no wise could he leave that lofty spot, or descend the wide 3
marmoreal fights flung endlessly down to where those streets of elder witchery 3
lay outspread and beckoning. 3
3
When for the third time he awakened with those flights still undescended and 3
those hushed sunset streets still untraversed, he prayed long and earnestly to the 3
hidden gods of dream that brood capricious above the clouds on unknown 3
Kadath, in the cold waste where no man treads. But the gods made no answer 3
and shewed no relenting, nor did they give any favouring sign when he prayed 3
to them in dream, and invoked them sacrificially through the bearded priests of 3
Nasht and Kaman-Thah, whose cavern-temple with its pillar of flame lies not far 3
from the gates of the waking world. It seemed, however, that his prayers must 3
have been adversely heard, for after even the first of them he ceased wholly to 3
3
3
3
436 3
3
3
3
behold the marvellous city; as if his three glimpses from afar had been mere 3
accidents or oversights, and against some hidden plan or wish of the gods. 3
3
At length, sick with longing for those glittering sunset streets and cryptical hill 3
lanes among ancient tiled roofs, nor able sleeping or waking to drive them from 3
his mind. Carter resolved to go with bold entreaty whither no man had gone 3
before, and dare the icy deserts through the dark to where unknown Kadath, 3
veiled in cloud and crowned with unimagined stars, holds secret and nocturnal 3
the onyx castle of the Great Ones. 3
3
In light slumber he descended the seventy steps to the cavern of flame and talked 3
of this design to the bearded priests Nasht and Kaman-Thah. And the priests 3
shook their pshent-bearing heads and vowed it would be the death of his soul. 3
They pointed out that the Great Ones had shown already their wish, and that it is 3
not agreeable to them to be harassed by insistent pleas. They reminded him, too, 3
that not only had no man ever been to Kadath, but no man had ever suspected in 3
what part of space it may lie; whether it be in the dreamlands around our own 3
world, or in those surrounding some unguessed companion of Fomalhaut or 3
Aldebaran. If in our dreamland, it might conceivably be reached, but only three 3
human souls since time began had ever crossed and recrossed the black impious 3
gulfs to other dreamlands, and of that three, two had come back quite mad. 3
There were, in such voyages, incalculable local dangers; as well as that shocking 3
final peril which gibbers unmentionably outside the ordered universe, where no 3
dreams reach; that last amorphous blight of nethermost confusion which 3
blasphemes and bubbles at the centre of all infinity - the boundless daemon 3
sultan Azathoth, whose name no lips dare speak aloud, and who gnaws hungrily 3
in inconceivable, unlighted chambers beyond time amidst the muffled, 3
maddening beating of vile drums and the thin, monotonous whine of accursed 3
flutes; to which detestable pounding and piping dance slowly, awkwardly, and 3
absurdly the gigantic Ultimate gods, the blind, voiceless, tenebrous, mindless 3
Other gods whose soul and messenger is the crawling chaos Nyarlathotep. 3
3
Of these things was Carter warned by the priests Nasht and Kaman-Thah in the 3
cavern of flame, but still he resolved to find the gods on unknown Kadath in the 3
cold waste, wherever that might be, and to win from them the sight and 3
remembrance and shelter of the marvellous sunset city. He knew that his journey 3
would be strange and long, and that the Great Ones would be against it; but 3
being old in the land of dream he counted on many useful memories and devices 3
to aid him. So asking a formal blessing of the priests and thinking shrewdly on 3
his course, he boldly descended the seven hundred steps to the Gate of Deeper 3
Slumber and set out through the Enchanted Wood. 3
3
3
3
437 3
3
3
3
In the tunnels of that twisted wood, whose low prodigious oaks twine groping 3
boughs and shine dim with the phosphorescence of strange fungi, dwell the 3
furtive and secretive Zoogs; who know many obscure secrets of the dream world 3
and a few of the waking world, since the wood at two places touches the lands of 3
men, though it would be disastrous to say where. Certain unexplained rumours, 3
events, and vanishments occur among men where the Zoogs have access, and it 3
is well that they cannot travel far outside the world of dreams. But over the 3
nearer parts of the dream world they pass freely, flitting small and brown and 3
unseen and bearing back piquant tales to beguile the hours around their hearths 3
in the forest they love. Most of them live in burrows, but some inhabit the trunks 3
of the great trees; and although they live mostly on fungi it is muttered that they 3
have also a slight taste for meat, either physical or spiritual, for certainly many 3
dreamers have entered that wood who have not come out. Carter, however, had 3
no fear; for he was an old dreamer and had learnt their fluttering language and 3
made many a treaty with them; having found through their help the splendid 3
city of Celephais in Ooth-Nargai beyond the Tanarian Hills, where reigns half 3
the year the great King Kuranes, a man he had known by another name in life. 3
Kuranes was the one soul who had been to the star-gulls and returned free from 3
madness. 3
3
Threading now the low phosphorescent aisles between those gigantic trunks. 3
Carter made fluttering sounds in the manner of the Zoogs, and listened now and 3
then for responses. He remembered one particular village of the creatures was in 3
the centre of the wood, where a circle of great mossy stones in what was once a 3
cleaning tells of older and more terrible dwellers long forgotten, and toward this 3
spot he hastened. He traced his way by the grotesque fungi, which always seem 3
better nourished as one approaches the dread circle where elder beings danced 3
and sacrificed. Finally the great light of those thicker fungi revealed a sinister 3
green and grey vastness pushing up through the roof of the forest and out of 3
sight. This was the nearest of the great ring of stones, and Carter knew he was 3
close to the Zoog village. Renewing his fluttering sound, he waited patiently; and 3
was at last rewarded by an impression of many eyes watching him. It was the 3
Zoogs, for one sees their weird eyes long before one can discern their small, 3
slippery brown outlines. 3
3
Out they swarmed, from hidden burrow and honeycombed tree, till the whole 3
dim-litten region was alive with them. Some of the wilder ones brushed Carter 3
unpleasantly, and one even nipped loathsomely at his ear; but these lawless 3
spirits were soon restrained by their elders. The Council of Sages, recognizing the 3
visitor, offered a gourd of fermented sap from a haunted tree unlike the others, 3
which had grown from a seed dropt down by someone on the moon; and as 3
Carter drank it ceremoniously a very strange colloquy began. The Zoogs did not, 3
unfortunately, know where the peak of Kadath lies, nor could they even say 3
3
3
3
438 3
3
3
3
whether the cold waste is in our dream world or in another. Rumours of the 3
Great Ones came equally from all points; and one might only say that they were 3
likelier to be seen on high mountain peaks than in valleys, since on such peaks 3
they dance reminiscently when the moon is above and the clouds beneath. 3
3
Then one very ancient Zoog recalled a thing unheard-of by the others; and said 3
that in Ulthar, beyond the River Skai, there still lingered the last copy of those 3
inconceivably old Pnakotic Manuscripts made by waking men in forgotten 3
boreal kingdoms and borne into the land of dreams when the hairy cannibal 3
Gnophkehs overcame many-templed Olathoe and slew all the heroes of the land 3
of Lomar. Those manuscripts he said, told much of the gods, and besides, in 3
Ulthar there were men who had seen the signs of the gods, and even one old 3
priest who had scaled a great mountain to behold them dancing by moonlight. 3
He had failed, though his companion had succeeded and perished namelessly. 3
3
So Randolph Carter thanked the Zoogs, who fluttered amicably and gave him 3
another gourd of moon-tree wine to take with him, and set out through the 3
phosphorescent wood for the other side, where the rushing Skai flows down 3
from the slopes of Lerion, and Hatheg and Nir and Ulthar dot the plain. Behind 3
him, furtive and unseen, crept several of the curious Zoogs; for they wished to 3
learn what might befall him, and bear back the legend to their people. The vast 3
oaks grew thicker as he pushed on beyond the village, and he looked sharply for 3
a certain spot where they would thin somewhat, standing quite dead or dying 3
among the unnaturally dense fungi and the rotting mould and mushy logs of 3
their fallen brothers. There he would turn sharply aside, for at that spot a mighty 3
slab of stone rests on the forest floor; and those who have dared approach it say 3
that it bears an iron ring three feet wide. Remembering the archaic circle of great 3
mossy rocks, and what it was possibly set up for, the Zoogs do not pause near 3
that expansive slab with its huge ring; for they realise that all which is forgotten 3
need not necessarily be dead, and they would not like to see the slab rise slowly 3
and deliberately. 3
3
Carter detoured at the proper place, and heard behind him the frightened 3
fluttering of some of the more timid Zoogs. He had known they would follow 3
him, so he was not disturbed; for one grows accustomed to the anomalies of 3
these prying creatures. It was twilight when he came to the edge of the wood, 3
and the strengthening glow told him it was the twilight of morning. Over fertile 3
plains rolling down to the Skai he saw the smoke of cottage chimneys, and on 3
every hand were the hedges and ploughed fields and thatched roofs of a peaceful 3
land. Once he stopped at a farmhouse well for a cup of water, and all the dogs 3
barked affrightedly at the inconspicuous Zoogs that crept through the grass 3
behind. At another house, where people were stirring, he asked questions about 3
3
3
3
439 3
3
3
3
the gods, and whether they danced often upon Lerion; but the farmer and his 3
wile would only make the Elder Sign and tell him the way to Nir and Ulthar. 3
3
At noon he walked through the one broad high street of Nir, which he had once 3
visited and which marked his farthest former travels in this direction; and soon 3
afterward he came to the great stone bridge across the Skai, into whose central 3
piece the masons had sealed a living human sacrifice when they built it thirteen- 3
hundred years before. Once on the other side, the frequent presence of cats (who 3
all arched their backs at the trailing Zoogs) revealed the near neighborhood of 3
Ulthar; for in Ulthar, according to an ancient and significant law, no man may 3
kill a cat. Very pleasant were the suburbs of Ulthar, with their little green 3
cottages and neatly fenced farms; and still pleasanter was the quaint town itself, 3
with its old peaked roofs and overhanging upper stories and numberless 3
chimney-pots and narrow hill streets where one can see old cobbles whenever 3
the graceful cats afford space enough. Carter, the cats being somewhat dispersed 3
by the half-seen Zoogs, picked his way directly to the modest Temple of the 3
Elder Ones where the priests and old records were said to be; and once within 3
that venerable circular tower of ivied stone - which crowns Ulthar's highest hill - 3
he sought out the patriarch Atal, who had been up the forbidden peak Hatheg- 3
Kia in the stony desert and had come down again alive. 3
3
Atal, seated on an ivory dais in a festooned shrine at the top of the temple, was 3
fully three centuries old; but still very keen of mind and memory. From him 3
Carter learned many things about the gods, but mainly that they are indeed only 3
Earth's gods, ruling feebly our own dreamland and having no power or 3
habitation elsewhere. They might, Atal said, heed a man's prayer if in good 3
humour; but one must not think of climbing to their onyx stronghold atop 3
Kadath in the cold waste. It was lucky that no man knew where Kadath towers, 3
for the fruits of ascending it would be very grave. Atal's companion Banni the 3
Wise had been drawn screaming into the sky for climbing merely the known 3
peak of Hatheg-Kia. With unknown Kadath, if ever found, matters would be 3
much worse; for although Earth's gods may sometimes be surpassed by a wise 3
mortal, they are protected by the Other Gods from Outside, whom it is better not 3
to discuss. At least twice in the world's history the Other Gods set their seal upon 3
Earth's primal granite; once in antediluvian times, as guessed from a drawing in 3
those parts of the Pnakotic Manuscripts too ancient to be read, and once on 3
Hatheg-Kia when Barzai the Wise tried to see Earth's gods dancing by 3
moonlight. So, Atal said, it would be much better to let all gods alone except in 3
tactful prayers. 3
3
Carter, though disappointed by Atal's discouraging advice and by the meagre 3
help to be found in the Pnakotic Manuscripts and the Seven Cryptical Books of 3
Hsan, did not wholly despair. First he questioned the old priest about that 3
3
3
3
440 3
3
3
3
marvellous sunset city seen from the railed terrace, thinking that perhaps he 3
might find it without the gods' aid; but Atal could tell him nothing. Probably, 3
Atal said, the place belonged to his especial dream world and not to the general 3
land of vision that many know; and conceivably it might be on another planet. In 3
that case Earth's gods could not guide him if they would. But this was not likely, 3
since the stopping of the dreams shewed pretty clearly that it was something the 3
Great Ones wished to hide from him. 3
3
Then Carter did a wicked thing, offering his guileless host so many draughts of 3
the moon-wine which the Zoogs had given him that the old man became 3
irresponsibly talkative. Robbed of his reserve, poor Atal babbled freely of 3
forbidden things; telling of a great image reported by travellers as carved on the 3
solid rock of the mountain Ngranek, on the isle of Oriab in the Southern Sea, and 3
hinting that it may be a likeness which Earth's gods once wrought of their own 3
features in the days when they danced by moonlight on that mountain. And he 3
hiccoughed likewise that the features of that image are very strange, so that one 3
might easily recognize them, and that they are sure signs of the authentic race of 3
the gods. 3
3
Now the use of all this in finding the gods became at once apparent to Carter. It 3
is known that in disguise the younger among the Great Ones often espouse the 3
daughters of men, so that around the borders of the cold waste wherein stands 3
Kadath the peasants must all bear their blood. This being so, the way to find that 3
waste must be to see the stone face on Ngranek and mark the features; then, 3
having noted them with care, to search for such features among living men. 3
Where they are plainest and thickest, there must the gods dwell nearest; and 3
whatever stony waste lies back of the villages in that place must be that wherein 3
stands Kadath. 3
3
Much of the Great Ones might be learnt in such regions, and those with their 3
blood might inherit little memories very useful to a seeker. They might not know 3
their parentage, for the gods so dislike to be known among men that none can be 3
found who has seen their faces wittingly; a thing which Carter realized even as 3
he sought to scale Kadath. But they would have queer lofty thoughts 3
misunderstood by their fellows, and would sing of far places and gardens so 3
unlike any known even in the dreamland that common folk would call them 3
fools; and from all this one could perhaps learn old secrets of Kadath, or gain 3
hints of the marvellous sunset city which the gods held secret. And more, one 3
might in certain cases seize some well-loved child of a god as hostage; or even 3
capture some young god himself, disguised and dwelling amongst men with a 3
comely peasant maiden as his bride. 3
3
3
3
441 3
3
3
3
Atal, however, did not know how to find Ngranek on its isle of Oriab; and 3
recommended that Carter follow the singing Skai under its bridges down to the 3
Southern Sea; where no burgess of Ulthar has ever been, but whence the 3
merchants come in boats or with long caravans of mules and two-wheeled carts. 3
There is a great city there, Dylath-Leen, but in Ulthar its reputation is bad 3
because of the black three-banked galleys that sail to it with rubies from no 3
clearly named shore. The traders that come from those galleys to deal with the 3
jewellers are human, or nearly so, but the rowers are never beheld; and it is not 3
thought wholesome in Ulthar that merchants should trade with black ships from 3
unknown places whose rowers cannot be exhibited. 3
3
By the time he had given this information Atal was very drowsy, and Carter laid 3
him gently on a couch of inlaid ebony and gathered his long beard decorously on 3
his chest. As he turned to go, he observed that no suppressed fluttering followed 3
him, and wondered why the Zoogs had become so lax in their curious pursuit. 3
Then he noticed all the sleek complacent cats of Ulthar licking their chops with 3
unusual gusto, and recalled the spitting and caterwauling he had faintly heard, 3
in lower parts of the temple while absorbed in the old priest's conversation. He 3
recalled, too, the evilly hungry way in which an especially impudent young 3
Zoog had regarded a small black kitten in the cobbled street outside. And 3
because he loved nothing on earth more than small black kittens, he stooped and 3
petted the sleek cats of Ulthar as they licked their chops, and did not mourn 3
because those inquisitive Zoogs would escort him no farther. 3
3
It was sunset now, so Carter stopped at an ancient inn on a steep little street 3
overlooking the lower town. And as he went out on the balcony of his room and 3
gazed down at the sea of red tiled roofs and cobbled ways and the pleasant fields 3
beyond, all mellow and magical in the slanted light, he swore that Ulthar would 3
be a very likely place to dwell in always, were not the memory of a greater 3
sunset city ever goading one onward toward unknown perils. Then twilight fell, 3
and the pink walls of the plastered gables turned violet and mystic, and little 3
yellow lights floated up one by one from old lattice windows. And sweet bells 3
pealed in. the temple tower above, and the first star winked softly above the 3
meadows across the Skai. With the night came song, and Carter nodded as the 3
lutanists praised ancient days from beyond the filigreed balconies and tesselated 3
courts of simple Ulthar. And there might have been sweetness even in the voices 3
of Ulthar's many cats, but that they were mostly heavy and silent from strange 3
feasting. Some of them stole off to those cryptical realms which are known only 3
to cats and which villagers say are on the moon's dark side, whither the cats leap 3
from tall housetops, but one small black kitten crept upstairs and sprang in 3
Carter's lap to purr and play, and curled up near his feet when he lay down at 3
last on the little couch whose pillows were stuffed with fragrant, drowsy herbs. 3

3
In the morning Carter joined a caravan of merchants bound for Dylath-Leen with 3
the spun wool of Ulthar and the cabbages of Ulthar's busy farms. And for six 3
days they rode with tinkhng bells on the smooth road beside the Skai; stopping 3
some nights at the inns of little quaint fishing towns, and on other nights 3
camping under the stars while snatches of boatmen's songs came from the placid 3
river. The country was very beautiful, with green hedges and groves and 3
picturesque peaked cottages and octagonal windmills. 3
3
On the seventh day a blur of smoke rose on the horizon ahead, and then the tall 3
black towers of Dylath-Leen, which is built mostly of basalt. Dylath-Leen with its 3
thin angular towers looks in the distance like a bit of the Giant's Causeway, and 3
its streets are dark and uninviting. There are many dismal sea-taverns near the 3
myriad wharves, and all the town is thronged with the strange seamen of every 3
land on earth and of a few which are said to be not on earth. Carter questioned 3
the oddly robed men of that city about the peak of Ngranek on the isle of Oriab, 3
and found that they knew of it well. 3
3
Ships came from Bahama on that island, one being due to return thither in only a 3
month, and Ngranek is but two days' zebra-ride from that port. But few had seen 3
the stone face of the god, because it is on a very difficult side of Ngranek, which 3
overlooks only sheer crags and a valley of sinister lava. Once the gods were 3
angered with men on that side, and spoke of the matter to the Other Gods. 3
3
It was hard to get this information from the traders and sailors in Dylath-Leen's 3
sea taverns, because they mostly preferred to whisper of the black galleys. One of 3
them was due in a week with rubies from its unknown shore, and the townsfolk 3
dreaded to see it dock. The mouths of the men who came from it to trade were 3
too wide, and the way their turbans were humped up in two points above their 3
foreheads was in especially bad taste. And their shoes were the shortest and 3
queerest ever seen in the Six Kingdoms. But worst of all was the matter of the 3
unseen rowers. Those three banks of oars moved too briskly and accurately and 3
vigorously to be comfortable, and it was not right for a ship to stay in port for 3
weeks while the merchants traded, yet to give no glimpse of its crew. It was not 3
fair to the tavern-keepers of Dylath-Leen, or to the grocers and butchers, either; 3
for not a scrap of provisions was ever sent aboard. The merchants took only gold 3
and stout black slaves from Parg across the river. That was all they ever took, 3
those unpleasantly featured merchants and their unseen rowers; never anything 3
from the butchers and grocers, but only gold and the fat black men of Parg 3
whom they bought by the pound. And the odours from those galleys which the 3
south wind blew in from the wharves are not to be described. Only by constantly 3
smoking strong thagweed could even the hardiest denizen of the old sea-taverns 3
bear them. Dylath-Leen would never have tolerated the black galleys had such 3
3
3
3
443 3
3
3
3
rubies been obtainable elsewhere, but no mine in all Earth's dreamland was 3
known to produce their like. 3
3
Of these things Dylath-Leen's cosmopolitan folk chiefly gossiped whilst Carter 3
waited patiently for the ship from Bahama, which might bear him to the isle 3
whereon carven Ngranek towers lofty and barren. Meanwhile he did not fall to 3
seek through the haunts of far travellers for any tales they might have concerning 3
Kadath in the cold waste or a marvellous city of marble walls and silver 3
fountains seen below terraces in the sunset. Of these things, however, he learned 3
nothing; though he once thought that a certain old slant-eyed merchant looked 3
queerly intelligent when the cold waste was spoken of. This man was reputed to 3
trade with the horrible stone villages on the icy desert plateau of Leng, which no 3
healthy folk visit and whose evil fires are seen at night from afar. He was even 3
rumoured to have dealt with that High-Priest Not To Be Described, which wears 3
a yellow silken mask over its face and dwells all alone in a prehistoric stone 3
monastery. That such a person might well have had nibbling traffick with such 3
beings as may conceivably dwell in the cold waste was not to be doubted, but 3
Carter soon found that it was no use questioning him. 3
3
Then the black galley slipped into the harbour past the basalt wale and the tall 3
lighthouse, silent and alien, and with a strange stench that the south wind drove 3
into the town. Uneasiness rustled through the taverns along that waterfront, and 3
after a while the dark wide-mouthed merchants with humped turbans and short 3
feet clumped steathily ashore to seek the bazaars of the jewellers. Carter 3
observed them closely, and disliked them more the longer he looked at them. 3
Then he saw them drive the stout black men of Parg up the gangplank grunting 3
and sweating into that singular galley, and wondered in what lands - or if in any 3
lands at all - those fat pathetic creatures might be destined to serve. 3
3
And on the third evening of that galley's stay one of the uncomfortable 3
merchants spoke to him, smirking sinfully and hinting of what he had heard in 3
the taverns of Carter's quest. He appeared to have knowledge too secret for 3
public telling; and although the sound of his voice was unbearably hateful. 3
Carter felt that the lore of so far a traveller must not be overlooked. He bade him 3
therefore be his guest in locked chambers above, and drew out the last of the 3
Zoogs' moon-wine to loosen his tongue. The strange merchant drank heavily, but 3
smirked unchanged by the draught. Then he drew forth a curious bottle with 3
wine of his own, and Carter saw that the bottle was a single hollowed ruby, 3
grotesquely carved in patterns too fabulous to be comprehended. He offered his 3
wine to his host, and though Carter took only the least sip, he felt the dizziness of 3
space and the fever of unimagined jungles. All the while the guest had been 3
smiling more and more broadly, and as Carter slipped into blankness the last 3
thing he saw was that dark odious face convulsed with evil laughter and 3
3
3
3
444 3
3
3
3
something quite unspeakable where one of the two frontal puffs of that orange 3
turban had become disarranged with the shakings of that epileptic mirth. 3
3
Carter next had consciousness amidst horrible odours beneath a tent-like awning 3
on the deck of a ship, with the marvellous coasts of the Southern Sea flying by in 3
unnatural swiftness. He was not chained, but three of the dark sardonic 3
merchants stood grinning nearby, and the sight of those humps in their turbans 3
made him almost as faint as did the stench that filtered up through the sinister 3
hatches. He saw slip past him the glorious lands and cities of which a fellow- 3
dreamer of earth - a lighthouse-keeper in ancient Kingsport - had often 3
discoursed in the old days, and recognized the templed terraces of Zak, abode of 3
forgotten dreams; the spires of infamous Thalarion, that daemon-city of a 3
thousand wonders where the eidolon Lathi reigns; the charnel gardens of Zura, 3
land of pleasures unattained, and the twin headlands of crystal, meeting above in 3
a resplendent arch, which guard the harbour of Sona-Nyl, blessed land of fancy. 3
3
Past all these gorgeous lands the malodourous ship flew unwholesomely, urged 3
by the abnormal strokes of those unseen rowers below. And before the day was 3
done Carter saw that the steersman could have no other goal than the Basalt 3
Pillars of the West, beyond which simple folk say splendid Cathuria lies, but 3
which wise dreamers well know are the gates of a monstrous cataract wherein 3
the oceans of earth's dreamland drop wholly to abysmal nothingness and shoot 3
through the empty spaces toward other worlds and other stars and the awful 3
voids outside the ordered universe where the daemon sultan Azathoth gnaws 3
hungrily in chaos amid pounding and piping and the hellish dancing of the 3
Other Gods, blind, voiceless, tenebrous, and mindless, with their soul and 3
messenger Nyarlathotep. 3
3
Meanwhile the three sardonic merchants would give no word of their intent, 3
though Carter well knew that they must be leagued with those who wished to 3
hold him from his quest. It is understood in the land of dream that the Other 3
Gods have many agents moving among men; and all these agents, whether 3
wholly human or slightly less than human, are eager to work the will of those 3
blind and mindless things in return for the favour of their hideous soul and 3
messenger, the crawling chaos Nyarlathotep. So Carter inferred that the 3
merchants of the humped turbans, hearing of his daring search for the Great 3
Ones in their castle of Kadath, had decided to take him away and deliver him to 3
Nyarlathotep for whatever nameless bounty might be offered for such a prize. 3
What might be the land of those merchants in our known universe or in the 3
eldritch spaces outside. Carter could not guess; nor could he imagine at what 3
hellish trysting-place they would meet the crawling chaos to give him up and 3
claim their reward. He knew, however, that no beings as nearly human as these 3
3
3
3
445 3
3
3
3
would dare approach the ultimate nighted throne of the daemon Azathoth in the 3
formless central void. 3
3
At the set of sun the merchants licked their excessively wide lips and glared 3
hungrily and one of them went below and returned from some hidden and 3
offensive cabin with a pot and basket of plates. Then they squatted close together 3
beneath the awning and ate the smoking meat that was passed around. But when 3
they gave Carter a portion, he found something very terrible in the size and 3
shape of it; so that he turned even paler than before and cast that portion into the 3
sea when no eye was on him. And again he thought of those unseen rowers 3
beneath, and of the suspicious nourishment from which their far too mechanical 3
strength was derived. 3
3
It was dark when the galley passed betwixt the Basalt Pillars of the West and the 3
sound of the ultimate cataract swelled portentous from ahead. And the spray of 3
that cataract rose to obscure the stars, and the deck grew damp, and the vessel 3
reeled in the surging current of the brink. Then with a queer whistle and plunge 3
the leap was taken, and Carter felt the terrors of nightmare as earth fell away and 3
the great boat shot silent and comet-like into planetary space. Never before had 3
he known what shapeless black things lurk and caper and flounder all through 3
the aether, leering and grinning at such voyagers as may pass, and sometimes 3
feeling about with slimy paws when some moving object excites their curiosity. 3
These are the nameless larvae of the Other Gods, and like them are blind and 3
without mind, and possessed of singular hungers and thirsts. 3
3
But that offensive galley did not aim as far as Carter had feared, for he soon saw 3
that the helmsman was steering a course directly for the moon. The moon was a 3
crescent shining larger and larger as they approached it, and shewing its singular 3
craters and peaks uncomfortably. The ship made for the edge, and it soon 3
became clear that its destination was that secret and mysterious side which is 3
always turned away from earth, and which no fully human person, save perhaps 3
the dreamer Snireth-Ko, has ever beheld. The close aspect of the moon as the 3
galley drew near proved very disturbing to Carter, and he did not like the size 3
and shape of the ruins which crumbled here and there. The dead temples on the 3
mountains were so placed that they could have glorified no suitable or 3
wholesome gods, and in the symmetries of the broken columns there seemed to 3
be some dark and inner meaning which did not invite solution. And what the 3
structure and proportions of the olden worshippers could have been. Carter 3
steadily refused to conjecture. 3
3
When the ship rounded the edge, and sailed over those lands unseen by man, 3
there appeared in the queer landscape certain signs of life, and Carter saw many 3
low, broad, round cottages in fields of grotesque whitish fungi. He noticed that 3
3
3
3
446 3
3
3
3
these cottages had no windows, and thought that their shape suggested the huts 3
of Esquimaux. Then he ghmpsed the oily waves of a sluggish sea, and knew that 3
the voyage was once more to be by water - or at least through some liquid. The 3
galley struck the surface with a peculiar sound, and the odd elastic way the 3
waves received it was very perplexing to Carter. 3
3
They now slid along at great speed, once passing and hailing another galley of 3
kindred form, but generally seeing nothing but that curious sea and a sky that 3
was black and star-strewn even though the sun shone scorchingly in it. 3
3
There presently rose ahead the jagged hills of a leprous-looking coast, and Carter 3
saw the thick unpleasant grey towers of a city. The way they leaned and bent, the 3
manner in which they were clustered, and the fact that they had no windows at 3
all, was very disturbing to the prisoner; and he bitterly mourned the folly which 3
had made him sip the curious wine of that merchant with the humped turban. 3
As the coast drew nearer, and the hideous stench of that city grew stronger, he 3
saw upon the jagged hills many forests, some of whose trees he recognized as 3
akin to that solitary moon-tree in the enchanted wood of earth, from whose sap 3
the small brown Zoogs ferment their curious wine. 3
3
Carter could now distinguish moving figures on the noisome wharves ahead, 3
and the better he saw them the worse he began to fear and detest them. For they 3
were not men at all, or even approximately men, but great greyish-white slippery 3
things which could expand and contract at will, and whose principal shape - 3
though it often changed - was that of a sort of toad without any eyes, but with a 3
curious vibrating mass of short pink tentacles on the end of its blunt, vague 3
snout. These objects were waddling busily about the wharves, moving bales and 3
crates and boxes with preternatural strength, and now and then hopping on or 3
off some anchored galley with long oars in their forepaws. And now and then 3
one would appear driving a herd of clumping slaves, which indeed were 3
approximate human beings with wide mouths like those merchants who traded 3
in Dylath-Leen; only these herds, being without turbans or shoes or clothing, did 3
not seem so very human after all. Some of the slaves - the fatter ones, whom a 3
sort of overseer would pinch experimentally - were unloaded from ships and 3
nailed in crates which workers pushed into the low warehouses or loaded on 3
great lumbering vans. 3
3
Once a van was hitched and driven off, and the, fabulous thing which drew it 3
was such that Carter gasped, even after having seen the other monstrosities of 3
that hateful place. Now and then a small herd of slaves dressed and turbaned 3
like the dark merchants would be driven aboard a galley, followed by a great 3
crew of the slippery toad-things as officers, navigators, and rowers. And Carter 3
saw that the almost-human creatures were reserved for the more ignominious 3
3
3
3
447 3
3
3
3
kinds of servitude which required no strength, such as steering and cooking, 3
fetching and carrying, and bargaining with men on the earth or other planets 3
where they traded. These creatures must have been convenient on earth, for they 3
were truly not unlike men when dressed and carefully shod and turbaned, and 3
could haggle in the shops of men without embarrassment or curious 3
explanations. But most of them, unless lean or ill-favoured, were unclothed and 3
packed in crates and drawn off in lumbering lorries by fabulous things. 3
Occasionally other beings were unloaded and crated; some very like these semi- 3
humans, some not so similar, and some not similar at all. And he wondered if 3
any of the poor stout black men of Parg were left to be unloaded and crated and 3
shipped inland in those obnoxious drays. 3
3
When the galley landed at a greasy-looking quay of spongy rock a nightmare 3
horde of toad-things wiggled out of the hatches, and two of them seized Carter 3
and dragged him ashore. The smell and aspect of that city are beyond telling, 3
and Carter held only scattered images of the tiled streets and black doorways 3
and endless precipices of grey vertical walls without windows. At length he was 3
dragged within a low doorway and made to climb infinite steps in pitch 3
blackness. It was, apparently, all one to the toad-things whether it were light or 3
dark. The odour of the place was intolerable, and when Carter was locked into a 3
chamber and left alone he scarcely had strength to crawl around and ascertain its 3
form and dimensions. It was circular, and about twenty feet across. 3
3
From then on time ceased to exist. At intervals food was pushed in, but Carter 3
would not touch it. What his fate would be, he did not know; but he felt that he 3
was held for the coming of that frightful soul and messenger of infinity's Other 3
Gods, the crawling chaos Nyarlathotep. Finally, after an unguessed span of 3
hours or days, the great stone door swung wide again, and Carter was shoved 3
down the stairs and out into the red-litten streets of that fearsome city. It was 3
night on the moon, and all through the town were stationed slaves bearing 3
torches. 3
3
In a detestable square a sort of procession was formed; ten of the toad-things and 3
twenty-four almost human torch-bearers, eleven on either side, and one each 3
before and behind. Carter was placed in the middle of the line; five toad-things 3
ahead and five behind, and one almost-human torch-bearer on either side of him. 3
Certain of the toad-things produced disgustingly carven flutes of ivory and made 3
loathsome sounds. To that hellish piping the column advanced out of the tiled 3
streets and into nighted plains of obscene fungi, soon commencing to climb one 3
of the lower and more gradual hills that lay behind the city. That on some 3
frightful slope or blasphemous plateau the crawling chaos waited. Carter could 3
not doubt; and he wished that the suspense might soon be over. The whining of 3
those impious flutes was shocking, and he would have given worlds for some 3
3
3
3
448 3
3
3
3
even half-normal sound; but these toad-things had no voices, and the slaves did 3
not talk. 3
3
Then through that star-specked darkness there did come a normal sound. It 3
rolled from the higher hills, and from all the jagged peaks around it was caught 3
up and echoed in a swelling pandaemoniac chorus. It was the midnight yell of 3
the cat, and Carter knew at last that the old village folk were right when they 3
made low guesses about the cryptical realms which are known only to cats, and 3
to which the elders among cats repair by stealth nocturnally, springing from high 3
housetops. Verily, it is to the moon's dark side that they go to leap and gambol 3
on the hills and converse with ancient shadows, and here amidst that column of 3
foetid things Carter heard their homely, friendly cry, and thought of the steep 3
roofs and warm hearths and little lighted windows of home. 3
3
Now much of the speech of cats was known to Randolph Carter, and in this far 3
terrible place he uttered the cry that was suitable. But that he need not have 3
done, for even as his lips opened he heard the chorus wax and draw nearer, and 3
saw swift shadows against the stars as small graceful shapes leaped from hill to 3
hill in gathering legions. The call of the clan had been given, and before the foul 3
procession had time even to be frightened a cloud of smothering fur and a 3
phalanx of murderous claws were tidally and tempestuously upon it. The flutes 3
stopped, and there were shrieks in the night. Dying almost-humans screamed, 3
and cats spit and yowled and roared, but the toad-things made never a sound as 3
their stinking green ichor oozed fatally upon that porous earth with the obscene 3
fungi. 3
3
It was a stupendous sight while the torches lasted, and Carter had never before 3
seen so many cats. Black, grey, and white; yellow, tiger, and mixed; common, 3
Persian, and Marix; Thibetan, Angora, and Egyptian; all were there in the fury of 3
battle, and there hovered over them some trace of that profound and inviolate 3
sanctity which made their goddess great in the temples of Bubastis. They would 3
leap seven strong at the throat of an almost-human or the pink tentacled snout of 3
a toad-thing and drag it down savagely to the fungous plain, where myriads of 3
their fellows would surge over it and into it with the frenzied claws and teeth of 3
a divine battle-fury. Carter had seized a torch from a stricken slave, but was soon 3
overborne by the surging waves of his loyal defenders. Then he lay in the utter 3
blackness hearing the clangour of war and the shouts of the victors, and feeling 3
the soft paws of his friends as they rushed to and fro over him in the fray. 3
3
At last awe and exhaustion closed his eyes, and when he opened them again it 3
was upon a strange scene. The great shining disc of the earth, thirteen times 3
greater than that of the moon as we see it, had risen with floods of weird light 3
over the lunar landscape; and across all those leagues of wild plateau and ragged 3
3
3
3
449 3
3
3
3
crest there squatted one endless sea of cats in orderly array. Circle on circle they 3
reached, and two or three leaders out of the ranks were licking his face and 3
purring to him consolingly. Of the dead slaves and toad-things there were not 3
many signs, but Carter thought he saw one bone a little way off in the open space 3
between him and the warriors. 3
3
Carter now spoke with the leaders in the soft language of cats, and learned that 3
his ancient friendship with the species was well known and often spoken of in 3
the places where cats congregate. He had not been unmarked in Ulthar when he 3
passed through, and the sleek old cats had remembered how he patted them 3
after they had attended to the hungry Zoogs who looked evilly at a small black 3
kitten. And they recalled, too, how he had welcomed the very little kitten who 3
came to see him at the inn, and how he had given it a saucer of rich cream in the 3
morning before he left. The grandfather of that very little kitten was the leader of 3
the army now assembled, for he had seen the evil procession from a far hill and 3
recognized the prisoner as a sworn friend of his kind on earth and in the land of 3
dream. 3
3
A yowl now came from the farther peak, and the old leader paused abruptly in 3
his conversation. It was one of the army's outposts, stationed on the highest of 3
the mountains to watch the one foe which Earth's cats fear; the very large and 3
peculiar cats from Saturn, who for some reason have not been oblivious of the 3
charm of our moon's dark side. They are leagued by treaty with the evil toad- 3
things, and are notoriously hostile to our earthly cats; so that at this juncture a 3
meeting would have been a somewhat grave matter. 3
3
After a brief consultation of generals, the cats rose and assumed a closer 3
formation, crowding protectingly around Carter and preparing to take the great 3
leap through space back to the housetops of our earth and its dreamland. The old 3
field-marshal advised Carter to let himself be borne along smoothly and 3
passively in the massed ranks of furry leapers, and told him how to spring when 3
the rest sprang and land gracefully when the rest landed. He also offered to 3
deposit him in any spot he desired, and Carter decided on the city of Dylath- 3
Leen whence the black galley had set out; for he wished to sail thence for Oriab 3
and the carven crest Ngranek, and also to warn the people of the city to have no 3
more traffick with black galleys, if indeed that traffick could be tactfully and 3
judiciously broken off. Then, upon a signal, the cats all leaped gracefully with 3
their friend packed securely in their midst; while in a black cave on an 3
unhallowed summit of the moon-mountains still vainly waited the crawling 3
chaos Nyarlathotep. 3
3
The leap of the cats through space was very swift; and being surrounded by his 3
companions Carter did not see this time the great black shapelessnesses that lurk 3
3
3
3
450 3
3
3
3
and caper and flounder in the abyss. Before he fully realised what had happened 3
he was back in his familiar room at the inn at Dylath-Leen, and the stealthy, 3
friendly cats were pouring out of the window in streams. The old leader from 3
Ulthar was the last to leave, and as Carter shook his paw he said he would be 3
able to get home by cockcrow. When dawn came. Carter went downstairs and 3
learned that a week had elapsed since his capture and leaving. There was still 3
nearly a fortnight to wait for the ship bound toward Oriab, and during that time 3
he said what he could against the black galleys and their infamous ways. Most of 3
the townsfolk believed him; yet so fond were the jewellers of great rubies that 3
none would wholly promise to cease trafficking with the wide-mouthed 3
merchants. If aught of evil ever befalls Dylath-Leen through such traffick, it will 3
not be his fault. 3
3
In about a week the desiderate ship put in by the black wale and tall lighthouse, 3
and Carter was glad to see that she was a barque of wholesome men, with 3
painted sides and yellow lateen sails and a grey captain in silken robes. Her 3
cargo was the fragrant resin of Oriab's inner groves, and the delicate pottery 3
baked by the artists of Bahama, and the strange little figures carved from 3
Ngranek's ancient lava. For this they were paid in the wool of Ulthar and the 3
iridescent textiles of Hatheg and the ivory that the black men carve across the 3
river in Parg. Carter made arrangements with the captain to go to Bahama and 3
was told that the voyage would take ten days. And during his week of waiting 3
he talked much with that captain of Ngranek, and was told that very few had 3
seen the carven face thereon; but that most travellers are content to learn its 3
legends from old people and lava-gatherers and image-makers in Bahama and 3
afterward say in their far homes that they have indeed beheld it. The captain was 3
not even sure that any person now living had beheld that carven face, for the 3
wrong side of Ngranek is very difficult and barren and sinister, and there are 3
rumours of caves near the peak wherein dwell the night-gaunts. But the captain 3
did not wish to say just what a night-gaunt might be like, since such cattle are 3
known to haunt most persistently the dreams of those who think too often of 3
them. Then Carter asked that captain about unknown Kadath in the cold waste, 3
and the marvellous sunset city, but of these the good man could truly tell 3
nothing. 3
3
Carter sailed out of Dylath-Leen one early morning when the tide turned, and 3
saw the first rays of sunrise on the thin angular towers of that dismal basalt 3
town. And for two days they sailed eastward in sight of green coasts, and saw 3
often the pleasant fishing towns that climbed up steeply with their red roofs and 3
chimney-pots from old dreaming wharves and beaches where nets lay drying. 3
But on the third day they turned sharply south where the roll of water was 3
stronger, and soon passed from sight of any land. On the fifth day the sailors 3
were nervous, but the captain apologized for their fears, saying that the ship was 3
3
3
3
451 3
3
3
3
about to pass over the weedy walls and broken columns of a sunken city too old 3
for memory, and that when the water was clear one could see so many moving 3
shadows in that deep place that simple folk disliked it. He admitted, moreover, 3
that many ships had been lost in that part of the sea; having been hailed when 3
quite close to it, but never seen again. 3
3
That night the moon was very bright, and one could see a great way down in the 3
water. There was so little wind that the ship could not move much, and the ocean 3
was very calm. Looking over the rail Carter saw many fathoms deep the dome of 3
the great temple, and in front of it an avenue of unnatural sphinxes leading to 3
what was once a public square. Dolphins sported merrily in and out of the ruins, 3
and porpoises revelled clumsily here and there, sometimes coming to the surface 3
and leaping clear out of the sea. As the ship drifted on a little the floor of the 3
ocean rose in hills, and one could clearly mark the lines of ancient climbing 3
streets and the washed-down walls of myriad little houses. 3
3
Then the suburbs appeared, and finally a great lone building on a hill, of simpler 3
architecture than the other structures, and in much better repair. It was dark and 3
low and covered four sides of a square, with a tower at each corner, a paved 3
court in the centre, and small curious round windows all over it. Probably it was 3
of basalt, though weeds draped the greater part; and such was its lonely and 3
impressive place on that far hill that it may have been a temple or a monastery. 3
Some phosphorescent fish inside it gave the small round windows an aspect of 3
shining, and Carter did not blame the sailors much for their fears. Then by the 3
watery moonlight he noticed an odd high monolith in the middle of that central 3
court, and saw that something was tied to it. And when after getting a telescope 3
from the captain's cabin he saw that that bound thing was a sailor in the silk 3
robes of Oriab, head downward and without any eyes, he was glad that a rising 3
breeze soon took the ship ahead to more healthy parts of the sea. 3
3
The next day they spoke with a ship with violet sails bound for Zar, in the land 3
of forgotten dreams, with bulbs of strange coloured lilies for cargo. And on the 3
evening of the eleventh day they came in sight of the isle of Oriab with Ngranek 3
rising jagged and snow-crowned in the distance. Oriab is a very great isle, and its 3
port of Bahama a mighty city. The wharves of Bahama are of porphyry, and the 3
city rises in great stone terraces behind them, having streets of steps that are 3
frequently arched over by buildings and the bridges between buildings. There is 3
a great canal which goes under the whole city in a tunnel with granite gates and 3
leads to the inland lake of Yath, on whose farther shore are the vast clay-brick 3
ruins of a primal city whose name is not remembered. As the ship drew into the 3
harbour at evening the twin beacons Thon and Thai gleamed a welcome, and in 3
all the million windows of Bahama's terraces mellow lights peeped out quietly 3
and gradually as the stars peep out overhead in the dusk, till that steep and 3
3
3
3
452 3
3
3
3
climbing seaport became a glittering constellation hung between the stars of 3
heaven and the reflections of those stars in the still harbour. 3
3
The captain, after landing, made Carter a guest in his own small house on the 3
shores of Yath where the rear of the town slopes down to it; and his wife and 3
servants brought strange toothsome foods for the traveller's delight. And in the 3
days after that Carter asked for rumours and legends of Ngranek in all the 3
taverns and public places where lava-gatherers and image-makers meet, but 3
could find no one who had been up the higher slopes or seen the carven face. 3
Ngranek was a hard mountain with only an accursed valley behind it, and 3
besides, one could never depend on the certainty that night-gaunts are altogether 3
fabulous. 3
3
When the captain sailed hack to Dylath-Leen Carter took quarters in an ancient 3
tavern opening on an alley of steps in the original part of the town, which is built 3
of brick and resembles the ruins of Yath's farther shore. Here he laid his plans for 3
the ascent of Ngranek, and correlated all that he had learned from the lava- 3
gatherers about the roads thither. The keeper of the tavern was a very old man, 3
and had heard so many legends that he was a great help. He even took Carter to 3
an upper room in that ancient house and shewed him a crude picture which a 3
traveller had scratched on the clay wall in the old days when men were bolder 3
and less reluctant to visit Ngranek's higher slopes. The old tavern-keeper's great- 3
grandfather had heard from his great-grandfather that the traveller who 3
scratched that picture had climbed Ngranek and seen the carven face, here 3
drawing it for others to behold, but Carter had very great doubts, since the large 3
rough features on the wall were hasty and careless, and wholly overshadowed 3
by a crowd of little companion shapes in the worst possible taste, with horns and 3
wings and claws and curling tails. 3
3
At last, having gained all the information he was likely to gain in the taverns and 3
public places of Bahama, Carter hired a zebra and set out one morning on the 3
road by Yath's shore for those inland parts wherein towers stony Ngranek. On 3
his right were rolling hills and pleasant orchards and neat little stone 3
farmhouses, and he was much reminded of those fertile fields that flank the Skai. 3
By evening he was near the nameless ancient ruins on Yath's farther shore, and 3
though old lava-gatherers had warned him not to camp there at night, he 3
tethered his zebra to a curious pillar before a crumbling wall and laid his blanket 3
in a sheltered corner beneath some carvings whose meaning none could 3
decipher. Around him he wrapped another blanket, for the nights are cold in 3
Oriab; and when upon awaking once he thought he felt the wings of some insect 3
brushing his face he covered his head altogether and slept in peace till roused by 3
the magah birds in distant resin groves. 3
3
3
3
453 3
3
3
3
The sun had just come up over the great slope whereon leagues of primal brick 3
foundations and worn walls and occasional cracked pillars and pedestals 3
stretched down desolate to the shore of Yath, and Carter looked about for his 3
tethered zebra. Great was his dismay to see that docile beast stretched prostrate 3
beside the curious pillar to which it had been tied, and still greater was he vexed 3
on finding that the steed was quite dead, with its blood all sucked away through 3
a singular wound in its throat. His pack had been disturbed, and several shiny 3
knickknacks taken away, and all round on the dusty soil' were great webbed 3
footprints for which he could not in any way account. The legends and warnings 3
of lava-gatherers occurred to him, and he thought of what had brushed his face 3
in the night. Then he shouldered his pack and strode on toward Ngranek, though 3
not without a shiver when he saw close to him as the highway passed through 3
the ruins a great gaping arch low in the wall of an old temple, with steps leading 3
down into darkness farther than he could peer. 3
3
His course now lay uphill through wilder and partly wooded country, and he 3
saw only the huts of charcoal-burners and the camp of those who gathered resin 3
from the groves. The whole air was fragrant with balsam, and all the magah 3
birds sang blithely as they flashed their seven colours in the sun. Near sunset he 3
came on a new camp of lava-gatherers returning with laden sacks from 3
Ngranek's lower slopes; and here he also camped, listening to the songs and tales 3
of the men, and overhearing what they whispered about a companion they had 3
lost. He had climbed high to reach a mass of fine lava above him, and at nightfall 3
did not return to his fellows. When they looked for him the next day they found 3
only his turban, nor was there any sign on the crags below that he had fallen. 3
They did not search any more, because the old man among them said it would be 3
of no use. 3
3
No one ever found what the night-gaunts took, though those beasts themselves 3
were so uncertain as to be almost fabulous. Carter asked them if night-gaunts 3
sucked blood and liked shiny things and left webbed footprints, but they all 3
shook their heads negatively and seemed frightened at his making such an 3
inquiry. When he saw how taciturn they had become he asked them no more, 3
but went to sleep in his blanket. 3
3
The next day he rose with the lava-gatherers and exchanged farewells as they 3
rode west and he rode east on a zebra he bought of them. Their older men gave 3
him blessings and warnings, and told him he had better not climb too high on 3
Ngranek, but while he thanked them heartily he was in no wise dissuaded. For 3
still did he feel that he must find the gods on unknown Kadath; and win from 3
them a way to that haunting and marvellous city in the sunset. By noon, after a 3
long uphill ride, he came upon some abandoned brick villages of the hill-people 3
who had once dwelt thus close to Ngranek and carved images from its smooth 3
3
3
3
454 3
3
3
3
lava. Here they had dweh till the days of the old tavernkeeper's grandfather, but 3
about that time they felt that their presence was disliked. Their homes had crept 3
even up the mountain's slope, and the higher they built the more people they 3
would miss when the sun rose. At last they decided it would be better to leave 3
altogether, since things were sometimes glimpsed in the darkness which no one 3
could interpret favourably; so in the end all of them went down to the sea and 3
dwelt in Bahama, inhabiting a very old quarter and teaching their sons the old 3
art of image-making which to this day they carry on. It was from these children 3
of the exiled hill-people that Carter had heard the best tales about Ngranek when 3
searching through Bahama's ancient taverns. 3
3
All this time the great gaunt side of Ngranek was looming up higher and higher 3
as Carter approached it. There were sparse trees on the lower slopes and feeble 3
shrubs above them, and then the bare hideous rock rose spectral into the sky, to 3
mix with frost and ice and eternal snow. Carter could see the rifts and 3
ruggedness of that sombre stone, and did not welcome the prospect of climbing 3
it. In places there were solid streams of lava, and scoriae heaps that littered 3
slopes and ledges. Ninety aeons ago, before even the gods had danced upon its 3
pointed peak, that mountain had spoken with fire and roared with the voices of 3
the inner thunders. Now it towered all silent and sinister, bearing on the hidden 3
side that secret titan image whereof rumour told. And there were caves in that 3
mountain, which might be empty and alone with elder darkness, or might - if 3
legend spoke truly - hold horrors of a form not to be surmised. 3
3
The ground sloped upward to the foot of Ngranek, thinly covered with scrub 3
oaks and ash trees, and strewn with bits of rock, lava, and ancient cinder. There 3
were the charred embers of many camps, where the lava-gatherers were wont to 3
stop, and several rude altars which they had built either to propitiate the Great 3
Ones or to ward off what they dreamed of in Ngranek's high passes and 3
labyrinthine caves. At evening Carter reached the farthermost pile of embers and 3
camped for the night, tethering his zebra to a sapling and wrapping himself well 3
in his blankets before going to sleep. And all through the night a voonith howled 3
distantly from the shore of some hidden pool, but Carter felt no fear of that 3
amphibious terror, since he had been told with certainty that not one of them 3
dares even approach the slope of Ngranek. 3
3
In the clear sunshine of morning Carter began the long ascent, taking his zebra as 3
far as that useful beast could go, but tying it to a stunted ash tree when the floor 3
of the thin wood became too steep. Thereafter he scrambled up alone; first 3
through the forest with its ruins of old villages in overgrown clearings, and then 3
over the tough grass where anaemic shrubs grew here and there. He regretted 3
coming clear of the trees, since the slope was very precipitous and the whole 3
thing rather dizzying. At length he began to discern all the countryside spread 3
3
3
3
455 3
3
3
3
out beneath him whenever he looked about; the deserted huts of the image- 3
makers, the groves of resin trees and the camps of those who gathered from 3
them, the woods where prismatic magahs nest and sing, and even a hint very far 3
away of the shores of Yath and of those forbidding ancient ruins whose name is 3
forgotten. He found it best not to look around, and kept on climbing and 3
climbing till the shrubs became very sparse and there was often nothing but the 3
tough grass to cling to. 3
3
Then the soil became meagre, with great patches of bare rock cropping out, and 3
now and then the nest of a condor in a crevice. Finally there was nothing at all 3
but the bare rock, and had it not been very rough and weathered, he could 3
scarcely have ascended farther. Knobs, ledges, and pinnacles, however, helped 3
greatly; and it was cheering to see occasionally the sign of some lava-gatherer 3
scratched clumsily in the friable stone, and know that wholesome human 3
creatures had been there before him. After a certain height the presence of man 3
was further shewn by handholds and footholds hewn where they were needed, 3
and by little quarries and excavations where some choice vein or stream of lava 3
had been found. In one place a narrow ledge had been chopped artificially to an 3
especially rich deposit far to the right of the main line of ascent. Once or twice 3
Carter dared to look around, and was almost stunned by the spread of landscape 3
below. All the island betwixt him and the coast lay open to his sight, with 3
Bahama's stone terraces and the smoke of its chimneys mystical in the distance. 3
And beyond that the illimitable Southern Sea with all its curious secrets. 3
3
Thus far there had been much winding around the mountain, so that the farther 3
and carven side was still hidden. Carter now saw a ledge running upward and to 3
the left which seemed to head the way he wished, and this course he took in the 3
hope that it might prove continuous. After ten minutes he saw it was indeed no 3
cul-de-sac, but that it led steeply on in an arc which would, unless suddenly 3
interrupted or deflected, bring him after a few hours' climbing to that unknown 3
southern slope overlooking the desolate crags and the accursed valley of lava. As 3
new country came into view below him he saw that it was bleaker and wilder 3
than those seaward lands he had traversed. The mountain's side, too, was 3
somewhat different; being here pierced by curious cracks and caves not found on 3
the straighter route he had left. Some of these were above him and some beneath 3
him, all opening on sheerly perpendicular cliffs and wholly unreachable by the 3
feet of man. The air was very cold now, but so hard was the climbing that he did 3
not mind it. Only the increasing rarity bothered him, and he thought that 3
perhaps it was this which had turned the heads of other travellers and excited 3
those absurd tales of night-gaunts whereby they explained the loss of such 3
climbers as fell from these perilous paths. He was not much impressed by 3
travellers' tales, but had a good curved scimitar in case of any trouble. All lesser 3
3
3
3
456 3
3
3
3
thoughts were lost in the wish to see that carven face which might set him on the 3
track of the gods atop unknown Kadath. 3
3
At last, in the fearsome iciness of upper space, he came round fully to the hidden 3
side of Ngranek and saw in infinite gulfs below him the lesser crags and sterile 3
abysses of lava which marked olden wrath of the Great Ones. There was 3
unfolded, too, a vast expanse of country to the south; but it was a desert land 3
without fair fields or cottage chimneys, and seemed to have no ending. No trace 3
of the sea was visible on this side, for Oriab is a great island. Black caverns and 3
odd crevices were still numerous on the sheer vertical cliffs, but none of them 3
was accessible to a climber. There now loomed aloft a great beetling mass which 3
hampered the upward view, and Carter was for a moment shaken with doubt 3
lest it prove impassable. Poised in windy insecurity miles above earth, with only 3
space and death on one side and only slippery walls of rock on the other, he 3
knew for a moment the fear that makes men shun Ngranek's hidden side. He 3
could not turn round, yet the sun was already low. If there were no way aloft, the 3
night would find him crouching there still, and the dawn would not find him at 3
all. 3
3
But there was a way, and he saw it in due season. Only a very expert dreamer 3
could have used those imperceptible footholds, yet to Carter they were sufficient. 3
Surmounting now the outward-hanging rock, he found the slope above much 3
easier than that below, since a great glacier's melting had left a generous space 3
with loam and ledges. To the left a precipice dropped straight from unknown 3
heights to unknown depths, with a cave's dark mouth just out of reach above 3
him. Elsewhere, however, the mountain slanted back strongly, and even gave 3
him space to lean and rest. 3
3
He felt from the chill that he must be near the snow line, and looked up to see 3
what glittering pinnacles might be shining in that late ruddy sunlight. Surely 3
enough, there was the snow uncounted thousands of feet above, and below it a 3
great beetling crag like that, he had just climbed; hanging there forever in bold 3
outline. And when he saw that crag he gasped and cried out aloud, and clutched 3
at the jagged rock in awe; for the titan bulge had not stayed as earth's dawn had 3
shaped it, but gleamed red and stupendous in the sunset with the carved and 3
polished features of a god. 3
3
Stern and terrible shone that face that the sunset lit with fire. How vast it was no 3
mind can ever measure, but Carter knew at once that man could never have 3
fashioned it. It was a god chiselled by the hands of the gods, and it looked down 3
haughty and majestic upon the seeker. Rumour had said it was strange and not 3
to be mistaken, and Carter saw that it was indeed so; for those long narrow eyes 3
3
3
3
457 3
3
3
3
and long-lobed ears, and that thin nose and pointed chin, all spoke of a race that 3
is not of men but of gods. 3
3
He clung overawed in that lofty and perilous eyrie, even though it was this 3
which he had expected and come to find; for there is in a god's face more of 3
marvel than prediction can tell, and when that face is vaster than a great temple 3
and seen looking downward at sunset in the scyptic silences of that upper world 3
from whose dark lava it was divinely hewn of old, the marvel is so strong that 3
none may escape it. 3
3
Here, too, was the added marvel of recognition; for although he had planned to 3
search all dreamland over for those whose likeness to this face might mark them 3
as the god's children, he now knew that he need not do so. Certainly, the great 3
face carven on that mountain was of no strange sort, but the kin of such as he 3
had seen often in the taverns of the seaport Celephais which lies in Ooth-Nargai 3
beyond the Tanarian Hills and is ruled over by that King Kuranes whom Carter 3
once knew in waking life. Every year sailors with such a face came in dark ships 3
from the north to trade their onyx for the carved jade and spun gold and little red 3
singing birds of Celephais, and it was clear that these could be no others than the 3
hall-gods he sought. Where they dwelt, there must the cold waste lie close, and 3
within it unknown Kadath and its onyx castle for the Great Ones. So to Celephais 3
he must go, far distant from the isle of Oriab, and in such parts as would take 3
him back to Dylath-Teen and up the Skai to the bridge by Nir, and again into the 3
enchanted wood of the Zoogs, whence the way would bend northward through 3
the garden lands by Oukranos to the gilded spires of Thran, where he might find 3
a galleon bound over the Cerenarian Sea. 3
3
But dusk was now thick, and the great carven face looked down even sterner in 3
shadow. Perched on that ledge night found the seeker; and in the blackness he 3
might neither go down nor go up, but only stand and cling and shiver in that 3
narrow place till the day came, praying to keep awake lest sleep loose his hold 3
and send him down the dizzy miles of air to the crags and sharp rocks of the 3
accursed valley. The stars came out, but save for them there was only black 3
nothingness in his eyes; nothingness leagued with death, against whose 3
beckoning he might do no more than cling to the rocks and lean back away from 3
an unseen brink. The last thing of earth that he saw in the gloaming was a condor 3
soaring close to the westward precipice beside him, and darting screaming away 3
when it came near the cave whose mouth yawned just out of reach. 3
3
Suddenly, without a warning sound in the dark. Carter felt his curved scimitar 3
drawn stealthily out of his belt by some unseen hand. Then he heard it clatter 3
down over the rocks below. And between him and the Milky Way he thought he 3
saw a very terrible outline of something noxiously thin and horned and tailed 3
3
3
3
458 3
3
3
3
and bat-winged. Other things, too, had begun to blot out patches of stars west of 3
him, as if a flock of vague entities were flapping thickly and silently out of that 3
inaccessible cave in the face of the precipice. Then a sort of cold rubbery arm 3
seized his neck and something else seized his feet, and he was lifted 3
inconsiderately up and swung about in space. Another minute and the stars were 3
gone, and Carter knew that the night-gaunts had got him. 3
3
They bore him breathless into that cliffside cavern and through monstrous 3
labyrinths beyond. When he struggled, as at first he did by instinct, they tickled 3
him with deliberation. They made no sound at all themselves, and even their 3
membranous wings were silent. They were frightfully cold and damp and 3
slippery, and their paws kneaded one detestably. Soon they were plunging 3
hideously downward through inconceivable abysses in a whirling, giddying, 3
sickening rush of dank, tomb-like air; and Carter felt they were shooting into the 3
ultimate vortex of shrieking and daemonic madness. He screamed again and 3
again, but whenever he did so the black paws tickled him with greater subtlety. 3
Then he saw a sort of grey phosphorescence about, and guessed they were 3
coming even to that inner world of subterrene horror of which dim legends tell, 3
and which is litten only by the pale death-fire wherewith reeks the ghoulish air 3
and the primal mists of the pits at earth's core. 3
3
At last far below him he saw faint lines of grey and ominous pinnacles which he 3
knew must be the fabled Peaks of Throk. Awful and sinister they stand in the 3
haunted disc of sunless and eternal depths; higher than man may reckon, and 3
guarding terrible valleys where the Dholes crawl and burrow nastily. But Carter 3
preferred to look at them than at his captors, which were indeed shocking and 3
uncouth black things with smooth, oily, whale-like surfaces, unpleasant horns 3
that curved inward toward each other, bat wings whose beating made no sound, 3
ugly prehensile paws, and barbed tails that lashed needlessly and disquietingly. 3
And worst of all, they never spoke or laughed, and never smiled because they 3
had no faces at all to smile with, but only a suggestive blankness where a face 3
ought to be. All they ever did was clutch and fly and tickle; that was the way of 3
night-gaunts. 3
3
As the band flew lower the Peaks of Throk rose grey and towering on all sides, 3
and one saw clearly that nothing lived on that austere and impressive granite of 3
the endless twilight. At still lower levels the death-fires in the air gave out, and 3
one met only the primal blackness of the void save aloft where the thin peaks 3
stood out goblin-like. Soon the peaks were very far away, and nothing about but 3
great rushing winds with the dankness of nethermost grottoes in them. Then in 3
the end the night-gaunts landed on a floor of unseen things which felt like layers 3
of bones, and left Carter all alone in that black valley. To bring him thither was 3
the duty of the night-gaunts that guard Ngranek; and this done, they flapped 3
3
3
3
459 3
3
3
3
away silently. When Carter tried to trace their flight he found he could not, since 3
even the Peaks of Throk had faded out of sight. There was nothing anywhere but 3
blackness and horror and silence and bones. 3
3
Now Carter knew from a certain source that he was in the vale of Pnoth, where 3
crawl and burrow the enormous Dholes; but he did not know what to expect, 3
because no one has ever seen a Dhole or even guessed what such a thing may be 3
like. Dholes are known only by dim rumour, from the rustling they make 3
amongst mountains of bones and the slimy touch they have when they wriggle 3
past one. They cannot be seen because they creep only in the dark. Carter did not 3
wish to meet a Dhole, so listened intently for any sound in the unknown depths 3
of bones about him. Even in this fearsome place he had a plan and an objective, 3
for whispers of Pnoth were not unknown to one with whom he had talked much 3
in the old days. In brief, it seemed fairly likely that this was the spot into which 3
all the ghouls of the waking world cast the refuse of their feastings; and that if he 3
but had good luck he might stumble upon that mighty crag taller even than 3
Throk's peaks which marks the edge of their domain. Showers of bones would 3
tell him where to look, and once found he could call to a ghoul to let down a 3
ladder; for strange to say, he had a very singular link with these terrible 3
creatures. 3
3
A man he had known in Boston - a painter of strange pictures with a secret 3
studio in an ancient and unhallowed alley near a graveyard - had actually made 3
friends with the ghouls and had taught him to understand the simpler part of 3
their disgusting meeping and glibbering. This man had vanished at last, and 3
Carter was not sure but that he might find him now, and use for the first time in 3
dreamland that far-away English of his dim waking life. In any case, he felt he 3
could persuade a ghoul to guide him out of Pnoth; and it would be better to meet 3
a ghoul, which one can see, than a Dhole, which one cannot see. 3
3
So Carter walked in the dark, and ran when he thought he heard something 3
among the bones underfoot. Once he bumped into a stony slope, and knew it 3
must be the base of one of Throk's peaks. Then at last he heard a monstrous 3
rattling and clatter which reached far up in the air, and became sure he had come 3
nigh the crag of the ghouls. He was not sure he could be heard from this valley 3
miles below, but realised that the inner world has strange laws. As he pondered 3
he was struck by a flying bone so heavy that it must have been a skull, and 3
therefore realising his nearness to the fateful crag he sent up as best he might that 3
meeping cry which is the call of the ghoul. 3
3
Sound travels slowly, so it was some time before he heard an answering glibber. 3
But it came at last, and before long he was told that a rope ladder would be 3
lowered. The wait for this was very tense, since there was no telling what might 3
3
3
3
460 3
3
3
3
not have been stirred up among those bones by his shouting. Indeed, it was not 3
long before he actually did hear a vague rustling afar off. As this thoughtfully 3
approached, he became more and more uncomfortable; for he did not wish to 3
move away from the spot where the ladder would come. Finally the tension 3
grew almost unbearable, and he was about to flee in panic when the thud of 3
something on the newly heaped bones nearby drew his notice from the other 3
sound. It was the ladder, and after a minute of groping he had it taut in his 3
hands. But the other sound did not cease, and followed him even as he climbed. 3
He had gone fully five feet from the ground when the rattling beneath waxed 3
emphatic, and was a good ten feet up when something swayed the ladder from 3
below. At a height which must have been fifteen or twenty feet he felt his whole 3
side brushed by a great slippery length which grew alternately convex and 3
concave with wriggling; and hereafter he climbed desperately to escape the 3
unendurable nuzzling of that loathsome and overfed Dhole whose form no man 3
might see. 3
3
For hours he climbed with aching and blistered hands, seeing again the grey 3
death-fire and Throk's uncomfortable pinnacles. At last he discerned above him 3
the projecting edge of the great crag of the ghouls, whose vertical side he could 3
not glimpse; and hours later he saw a curious face peering over it as a gargoyle 3
peers over a parapet of Notre Dame. This almost made him lose his hold through 3
faintness, but a moment later he was himself again; for his vanished friend 3
Richard Pickman had once introduced him to a ghoul, and he knew well their 3
canine faces and slumping forms and unmentionable idiosyncrasies. So he had 3
himself well under control when that hideous thing pulled him out of the dizzy 3
emptiness over the edge of the crag, and did not scream at the partly consumed 3
refuse heaped at one side or at the squatting circles of ghouls who gnawed and 3
watched curiously. 3
3
He was now on a dim-litten plain whose sole topographical features were great 3
boulders and the entrances of burrows. The ghouls were in general respectful, 3
even if one did attempt to pinch him while several others eyed his leanness 3
speculatively. Through patient glibbering he made inquiries regarding his 3
vanished friend, and found he had become a ghoul of some prominence in 3
abysses nearer the waking world. A greenish elderly ghoul offered to conduct 3
him to Pickman's present habitation, so despite a natural loathing he followed 3
the creature into a capacious burrow and crawled after him for hours in the 3
blackness of rank mould. They emerged on a dim plain strewn with singular 3
relics of earth - old gravestones, broken urns, and grotesque fragments of 3
monuments - and Carter realised with some emotion that he was probably 3
nearer the waking world than at any other time since he had gone down the 3
seven hundred steps from the cavern of flame to the Gate of Deeper Slumber. 3

There, on a tombstone of 1768 stolen from the Granary Burying Ground in 3
Boston, sat a ghoul which was once the artist Richard Upton Pickman. It was 3
naked and rubbery, and had acquired so much of the ghoulish physiognomy that 3
its human origin was already obscure. But it still remembered a little English, 3
and was able to converse with Carter in grunts and monosyllables, helped out 3
now and then by the glibbering of ghouls. When it learned that Carter wished to 3
get to the enchanted wood and from there to the city Celephais in Ooth-Nargai 3
beyond the Tanarian Hills, it seemed rather doubtful; for these ghouls of the 3
waking world do no business in the graveyards of upper dreamland (leaving 3
that to the red-footed wamps that are spawned in dead cities), and many things 3
intervene betwixt their gulf and the enchanted wood, including the terrible 3
kingdom of the Gugs. 3
3
The Gugs, hairy and gigantic, once reared stone circles in that wood and made 3
strange sacrifices to the Other Gods and the crawling chaos Nyarlathotep, until 3
one night an abomination of theirs reached the ears of earth's gods and they were 3
banished to caverns below. Only a great trap door of stone with an iron ring 3
connects the abyss of the earth-ghouls with the enchanted wood, and this the 3
Gugs are afraid to open because of a curse. That a mortal dreamer could traverse 3
their cavern realm and leave by that door is inconceivable; for mortal dreamers 3
were their former food, and they have legends of the toothsomeness of such 3
dreamers even though banishment has restricted their diet to the ghasts, those 3
repulsive beings which die in the light, and which live in the vaults of Zin and 3
leap on long hind legs like kangaroos. 3
3
So the ghoul that was Pickman advised Carter either to leave the abyss at 3
Sarkomand, that deserted city in the valley below Leng where black nitrous 3
stairways guarded by winged diarote lions lead down from dreamland to the 3
lower gulfs, or to return through a churchyard to the waking world and begin 3
the quest anew down the seventy steps of light slumber to the cavern of flame 3
and the seven hundred steps to the Gate of Deeper Slumber and the enchanted 3
wood. This, however, did not suit the seeker; for he knew nothing of the way 3
from Leng to Ooth-Nargai, and was likewise reluctant to awake lest he forget all 3
he had so far gained in this dream. It was disastrous to his quest to forget the 3
august and celestial faces of those seamen from the north who traded onyx in 3
Celephais, and who, being the sons of gods, must point the way to the cold waste 3
and Kadath where the Great Ones dwell. 3
3
After much persuasion the ghoul consented to guide his guest inside the great 3
wall of the Gugs' kingdom. There was one chance that Carter might be able to 3
steal through that twilight realm of circular stone towers at an hour when the 3
giants would be all gorged and snoring indoors, and reach the central tower with 3
the sign of Koth upon it, which has the stairs leading up to that stone trap door 3
3
3
3
462 3
3
3
3
in the enchanted wood. Pickman even consented to lend three ghouls to help 3
with a tombstone lever in raising the stone door; for of ghouls the Gugs are 3
somewhat afraid, and they often flee from their own colossal graveyards when 3
they see them feasting there. 3
3
He also advised Carter to disguise as a ghoul himself; shaving the beard he had 3
allowed to grow (for ghouls have none), wallowing naked in the mould to get 3
the correct surface, and loping in the usual slumping way, with his clothing 3
carried in a bundle as if it were a choice morsel from a tomb. They would reach 3
the city of Gugs - which is coterminous with the whole kingdom - through the 3
proper burrows, emerging in a cemetery not far from the stair-containing Tower 3
of Koth. They must beware, however, of a large cave near the cemetery; for this is 3
the mouth of the vaults of Zin, and the vindictive ghasts are always on watch 3
there murderously for those denizens of the upper abyss who hunt and prey on 3
them. The ghasts try to come out when the Gugs sleep and they attack ghouls as 3
readily as Gugs, for they cannot discriminate. They are very primitive, and eat 3
one another. The Gugs have a sentry at a narrow in the vaults of Zin, but he is 3
often drowsy and is sometimes surprised by a party of ghasts. Though ghasts 3
cannot live in real light, they can endure the grey twilight of the abyss for hours. 3
3
So at length Carter crawled through endless burrows with three helpful ghouls 3
bearing the slate gravestone of Col. Nepemiah Derby, obit 1719, from the Charter 3
Street Burying Ground in Salem. When they came again into open twilight they 3
were in a forest of vast lichened monoliths reaching nearly as high as the eye 3
could see and forming the modest gravestones of the Gugs. On the right of the 3
hole out of which they wriggled, and seen through aisles of monoliths, was a 3
stupendous vista of cyclopean round towers mounting up illimitable into the 3
grey air of inner earth. This was the great city of the Gugs, whose doorways are 3
thirty feet high. Ghouls come here often, for a buried Gug will feed a community 3
for almost a year, and even with the added peril it is better to burrow for Gugs 3
than to bother with the graves of men. Carter now understood the occasional 3
titan bones he had felt beneath him in the vale of Pnoth. 3
3
Straight ahead, and just outside the cemetery, rose a sheer perpendicular cliff at 3
whose base an immense and forbidding cavern yawned. This the ghouls told 3
Carter to avoid as much as possible, since it was the entrance to the unhallowed 3
vaults of Zin where Gugs hunt ghasts in the darkness. And truly, that warning 3
was soon well justified; for the moment a ghoul began to creep toward the 3
towers to see if the hour of the Gugs' resting had been rightly timed, there 3
glowed in the gloom of that great cavern's mouth first one pair of yellowish-red 3
eyes and then another, implying that the Gugs were one sentry less, and that 3
ghasts have indeed an excellent sharpness of smell. So the ghoul returned to the 3
burrow and motioned his companions to be silent. It was best to leave the ghasts 3
3
3
3
463 3
3
3
3
to their own devices, and there was a possibihty that they might soon withdraw, 3
since they must naturally be rather tired after coping with a Gug sentry in the 3
black vaults. After a moment something about the size of a small horse hopped 3
out into the grey twilight, and Carter turned sick at the aspect of that scabrous 3
and unwholesome beast, whose face is so curiously human despite the absence 3
of a nose, a forehead, and other important particulars. 3
3
Presently three other ghasts hopped out to join their fellow, and a ghoul 3
glibbered softly at Carter that their absence of battle-scars was a bad sign. It 3
proved that theY had not fought the Gug sentry at all, but had merely slipped 3
past him as he slept, so that their strength and savagery were still unimpaired 3
and would remain so till they had found and disposed of a victim. It was very 3
unpleasant to see those filthy and disproportioned animals which soon 3
numbered about fifteen, grubbing about and making their kangaroo leaps in the 3
grey twilight where titan towers and monoliths arose, but it was still more 3
unpleasant when they spoke among themselves in the coughing gutturals of 3
ghasts. And yet, horrible as they were, they were not so horrible as what 3
presently came out of the cave after them with disconcerting suddenness. 3
3
It was a paw, fully two feet and a half across, and equipped with formidable 3
talons. Alter it came another paw, and after that a great black-furred arm to 3
which both of the paws were attached by short forearms. Then two pink eyes 3
shone, and the head of the awakened Gug sentry, large as a barrel, wabbled into 3
view. The eyes jutted two inches from each side, shaded by bony protuberances 3
overgrown with coarse hairs. But the head was chiefly terrible because of the 3
mouth. That mouth had great yellow fangs and ran from the top to the bottom of 3
the head, opening vertically instead of horizontally. 3
3
But before that unfortunate Gug could emerge from the cave and rise to his full 3
twenty feet, the vindictive ghasts were upon him. Carter feared for a moment 3
that he would give an alarm and arouse all his kin, till a ghoul softly glibbered 3
that Gugs have no voice but talk by means of facial expression. The battle which 3
then ensued was truly a frightful one. From all sides the venomous ghasts 3
rushed feverishly at the creeping Gug, nipping and tearing with their muzzles, 3
and mauling murderously with their hard pointed hooves. All the time they 3
coughed excitedly, screaming when the great vertical mouth of the Gug would 3
occasionally bite into one of their number, so that the noise of the combat would 3
surely have aroused the sleeping city had not the weakening of the sentry begun 3
to transfer the action farther and farther within the cavern. As it was, the tumult 3
soon receded altogether from sight in the blackness, with only occasional evil 3
echoes to mark its continuance. 3
3
3
3
464 3
3
3
3
Then the most alert of the ghouls gave the signal for all to advance, and Carter 3
followed the loping three out of the forest of monoliths and into the dark 3
noisome streets of that awful city whose rounded towers of cyclopean stone 3
soared up beyond the sight. Silently they shambled over that rough rock 3
pavement, hearing with disgust the abominable muffled snortings from great 3
black doorways which marked the slumber of the Gugs. Apprehensive of the 3
ending of the rest hour, the ghouls set a somewhat rapid pace; but even so the 3
journey was no brief one, for distances in that town of giants are on a great scale. 3
At last, however, they came to a somewhat open space before a tower even 3
vaster than the rest; above whose colossal doorway was fixed a monstrous 3
symbol in bas-relief which made one shudder without knowing its meaning. 3
This was the central tower with the sign of Koth, and those huge stone steps just 3
visible through the dusk within were the beginning of the great flight leading to 3
upper dreamland and the enchanted wood. 3
3
There now began a climb of interminable length in utter blackness: made almost 3
impossible by the monstrous size of the steps, which were fashioned for Gugs, 3
and were therefore nearly a yard high. Of their number Carter could form no just 3
estimate, for he soon became so worn out that the tireless and elastic ghouls were 3
forced to aid him. All through the endless climb there lurked the peril of 3
detection and pursuit; for though no Gug dares lift the stone door to the forest 3
because of the Great One's curse, there are no such restraints concerning the 3
tower and the steps, and escaped ghasts are often chased, even to the very top. 3
So sharp are the ears of Gugs, that the bare feet and hands of the climbers might 3
readily be heard when the city awoke; and it would of course take but little time 3
for the striding giants, accustomed from their ghast-hunts in the vaults of Zin to 3
seeing without light, to overtake their smaller and slower quarry on those 3
cyclopean steps. It was very depressing to reflect that the silent pursuing Gugs 3
would not be heard at all, but would come very suddenly and shockingly in the 3
dark upon the climbers. Nor could the traditional fear of Gugs for ghouls be 3
depended upon in that peculiar place where the advantages lay so heavily with 3
the Gugs. There was also some peril from the furtive and venomous ghasts, 3
which frequently hopped up onto the tower during the sleep hour of the Gugs. If 3
the Gugs slept long, and the ghasts returned soon from their deed in the cavern, 3
the scent of the climbers might easily be picked up by those loathsome and ill- 3
disposed things; in which case it would almost be better to be eaten by a Gug. 3
3
Then, after aeons of climbing, there came a cough from the darkness above; and 3
matters assumed a very grave and unexpected turn. 3
3
It was clear that a ghast, or perhaps even more, had strayed into that tower 3
before the coming of Carter and his guides; and it was equally clear that this peril 3
was very close. Alter a breathless second the leading ghoul pushed Carter to the 3
3
3
3
465 3
3
3
3
wall and arranged his kinfolk in the best possible way, with the old slate 3
tombstone raised for a crushing blow whenever the enemy might come in sight. 3
Ghouls can see in the dark, so the party was not as badly off as Carter would 3
have been alone. In another moment the clatter of hooves revealed the 3
downward hopping of at least one beast, and the slab-bearing ghouls poised 3
their weapon for a desperate blow. Presently two yellowish-red eyes flashed into 3
view, and the panting of the ghast became audible above its clattering. As it 3
hopped down to the step above the ghouls, they wielded the ancient gravestone 3
with prodigious force, so that there was only a wheeze and a choking before the 3
victim collapsed in a noxious heap. There seemed to be only this one animal, and 3
after a moment of listening the ghouls tapped Carter as a signal to proceed again. 3
As before, they were obliged to aid him; and he was glad to leave that place of 3
carnage where the ghast's uncouth remains sprawled invisible in the blackness. 3
3
At last the ghouls brought their companion to a halt; and feeling above him. 3
Carter realised that the great stone trap door was reached at last. To open so vast 3
a thing completely was not to be thought of, but the ghouls hoped to get it up 3
just enough to slip the gravestone under as a prop, and permit Carter to escape 3
through the crack. They themselves planned to descend again and return 3
through the city of the Gugs, since their elusiveness was great, and they did not 3
know the way overland to spectral Sarkomand with its lion-guarded gate to the 3
abyss. 3
3
Mighty was the straining of those three ghouls at the stone of the door above 3
them, and Carter helped push with as much strength as he had. They judged the 3
edge next the top of the staircase to be the right one, and to this they bent all the 3
force of their disreputably nourished muscles. Alter a few moments a crack of 3
light appeared; and Carter, to whom that task had been entrusted, slipped the 3
end of the old gravestone in the aperture. There now ensued a mighty heaving; 3
but progress was very slow, and they had of course to return to their first 3
position every time they failed to turn the slab and prop the portal open. 3
3
Suddenly their desperation was magnified a thousand fold by a sound on the 3
steps below them. It was only the thumping and rattling of the slain ghast's 3
hooved body as it rolled down to lower levels; but of all the possible causes of 3
that body's dislodgement and rolling, none was in the least reassuring. 3
Therefore, knowing the ways of Gugs, the ghouls set to with something of a 3
frenzy; and in a surprisingly short time had the door so high that they were able 3
to hold it still whilst Carter turned the slab and left a generous opening. They 3
now helped Carter through, letting him climb up to their rubbery shoulders and 3
later guiding his feet as he clutched at the blessed soil of the upper dreamland 3
outside. Another second and they were through themselves, knocking away the 3
gravestone and closing the great trap door while a panting became audible 3
3
3
3
466 3
3
3
3
beneath. Because of the Great One's curse no Gug might ever emerge from that 3
portal, so with a deep rehef and sense of repose Carter lay quietly on the thick 3
grotesque fungi of the enchanted wood while his guides squatted near in the 3
manner that ghouls rest. 3
3
Weird as was that enchanted wood through which he had fared so long ago, it 3
was verily a haven and a delight after those gulfs he had now left behind. There 3
was no living denizen about, for Zoogs shun the mysterious door in fear and 3
Carter at once consulted with his ghouls about their future course. To return 3
through the tower they no longer dared, and the waking world did not appeal to 3
them when they learned that they must pass the priests Nasht and Kaman-Thah 3
in the cavern of flame. So at length they decided to return through Sarkomand 3
and its gate of the abyss, though of how to get there they knew nothing. Carter 3
recalled that it lies in the valley below Leng, and recalled likewise that he had 3
seen in Dylath-Leen a sinister, slant-eyed old merchant reputed to trade on Leng, 3
therefore he advised the ghouls to seek out Dylath-Leen, crossing the fields to 3
Nir and the Skai and following the river to its mouth. This they at once resolved 3
to do, and lost no time in loping off, since the thickening of the dusk promised a 3
full night ahead for travel. And Carter shook the paws of those repulsive beasts, 3
thanking them for their help and sending his gratitude to the beast which once 3
was Pickman; but could not help sighing with pleasure when they left. For a 3
ghoul is a ghoul, and at best an unpleasant companion for man. After that Carter 3
sought a forest pool and cleansed himself of the mud of nether earth, thereupon 3
reassuming the clothes he had so carefully carried. 3
3
It was now night in that redoubtable wood of monstrous trees, but because of the 3
phosphorescence one might travel as well as by day; wherefore Carter set out 3
upon the well-known route toward Celephais, in Ooth-Nargai beyond the 3
Tanarian Hills. And as he went he thought of the zebra he had left tethered to an 3
ash-tree on Ngranek in far-away Oriab so many aeons ago, and wondered if any 3
lava-gatherers had fed and released it. And he wondered, too, if he would ever 3
return to Bahama and pay for the zebra that was slain by night in those ancient 3
ruins by Yath's shore, and if the old tavernkeeper would remember him. Such 3
were the thoughts that came to him in the air of the regained upper dreamland. 3
3
But presently his progress was halted by a sound from a very large hollow tree. 3
He had avoided the great circle of stones, since he did not care to speak with 3
Zoogs just now; but it appeared from the singular fluttering in that huge tree that 3
important councils were in session elsewhere. Upon drawing nearer he made out 3
the accents of a tense and heated discussion; and before long became conscious 3
of matters which he viewed with the greatest concern. For a war on the cats was 3
under debate in that sovereign assembly of Zoogs. It all came from the loss of the 3
party which had sneaked after Carter to Ulthar, and which the cats had justly 3
3
3
3
467 3
3
3
3
punished for unsuitable intentions. The matter had long rankled; and now, or at 3
least within a month, the marshalled Zoogs were about to strike the whole feline 3
tribe in a series of surprise attacks, taking individual cats or groups of cats 3
unawares, and giving not even the myriad cats of Ulthar a proper chance to drill 3
and mobilise. This was the plan of the Zoogs, and Carter saw that he must foil it 3
before leaving upon his mighty quest. 3
3
Very quietly therefore did Randolph Carter steal to the edge of the wood and 3
send the cry of the cat over the starlit fields. And a great grimalkin in a nearby 3
cottage took up the burden and relayed it across leagues of rolling meadow to 3
warriors large and small, black, grey, tiger, white, yellow, and mixed, and it 3
echoed through Nir and beyond the Skai even into Ulthar, and Ulthar's 3
numerous cats called in chorus and fell into a line of march. It was fortunate that 3
the moon was not up, so that all the cats were on earth. Swiftly and silently 3
leaping, they sprang from every hearth and housetop and poured in a great furry 3
sea across the plains to the edge of the wood. Carter was there to greet them, and 3
the sight of shapely, wholesome cats was indeed good for his eyes after the 3
things he had seen and walked with in the abyss. He was glad to see his 3
venerable friend and one-time rescuer at the head of Ulthar's detachment, a 3
collar of rank around his sleek neck, and whiskers bristling at a martial angle. 3
Better still, as a sub-lieutenant in that army was a brisk young fellow who proved 3
to be none other than the very little kitten at the inn to whom Carter had given a 3
saucer of rich cream on that long-vanished morning in Ulthar. He was a 3
strapping and promising cat now, and purred as he shook hands with his friend. 3
His grandfather said he was doing very well in the army, and that he might well 3
expect a captaincy after one more campaign. 3
3
Carter now outlined the peril of the cat tribe, and was rewarded by deep- 3
throated purrs of gratitude from all sides. Consulting with the generals, he 3
prepared a plan of instant action which involved marching at once upon the 3
Zoog council and other known strongholds of Zoogs; forestalling their surprise 3
attacks and forcing them to terms before the mobilization of their army of 3
invasion. Thereupon without a moment's loss that great ocean of cats flooded the 3
enchanted wood and surged around the council tree and the great stone circle. 3
Flutterings rose to panic pitch as the enemy saw the newcomers and there was 3
very little resistance among the furtive and curious brown Zoogs. They saw that 3
they were beaten in advance, and turned from thoughts of vengeance to 3
thoughts of present self-preservation. 3
3
Half the cats now seated themselves in a circular formation with the captured 3
Zoogs in the centre, leaving open a lane down which were marched the 3
additional captives rounded up by the other cats in other parts of the wood. 3
Terms were discussed at length. Carter acting as interpreter, and it was decided 3
3
3
3
468 3
3
3
3
that the Zoogs might remain a free tribe on condition of rendering to the cats a 3
large tribute of grouse, quail, and pheasants from the less fabulous parts of the 3
forest. Twelve young Zoogs of noble families were taken as hostages to be kept 3
in the Temple of Cats at Ulthar, and the victors made it plain that any 3
disappearances of cats on the borders of the Zoog domain would be followed by 3
consequences highly disastrous to Zoogs. These matters disposed of, the 3
assembled cats broke ranks and permitted the Zoogs to slink off one by one to 3
their respective homes, which they hastened to do with many a sullen backward 3
glance. 3
3
The old cat general now offered Carter an escort through the forest to whatever 3
border he wished to reach, deeming it likely that the Zoogs would harbour dire 3
resentment against him for the frustration of their warlike enterprise. This offer 3
he welcomed with gratitude; not only for the safety it afforded, but because he 3
liked the graceful companionship of cats. So in the midst of a pleasant and 3
playful regiment, relaxed after the successful performance of its duty, Randolph 3
Carter walked with dignity through that enchanted and phosphorescent wood of 3
titan trees, talking of his quest with the old general and his grandson whilst 3
others of the band indulged in fantastic gambols or chased fallen leaves that the 3
wind drove among the fungi of that primeval floor. And the old cat said that he 3
had heard much of unknown Kadath in the cold waste, but did not know where 3
it was. As for the marvellous sunset city, he had not even heard of that, but 3
would gladly relay to Carter anything he might later learn. 3
3
He gave the seeker some passwords of great value among the cats of dreamland, 3
and commended him especially to the old chief of the cats in Celephais, whither 3
he was bound. That old cat, already slightly known to Carter, was a dignified 3
maltese; and would prove highly influential in any transaction. It was dawn 3
when they came to the proper edge of the wood, and Carter bade his friends a 3
reluctant farewell. The young sub-lieutenant he had met as a small kitten would 3
have followed him had not the old general forbidden it, but that austere 3
patriarch insisted that the path of duty lay with the tribe and the army. So Carter 3
set out alone over the golden fields that stretched mysterious beside a willow- 3
fringed river, and the cats went back into the wood. 3
3
Well did the traveller know those garden lands that lie betwixt the wood of the 3
Cerenerian Sea, and blithely did he follow the singing river Oukianos that 3
marked his course. The sun rose higher over gentle slopes of grove and lawn, 3
and heightened the colours of the thousand flowers that starred each knoll and 3
dangle. A blessed haze lies upon all this region, wherein is held a little more of 3
the sunlight than other places hold, and a little more of the summer's humming 3
music of birds and bees; so that men walk through it as through a faery place, 3
and feel greater joy and wonder than they ever afterward remember. 3
3
3
3
469 3
3
3
3
By noon Carter reached the jasper terraces of Kiran which slope down to the 3
river's edge and bear that temple of loveliness wherein the King of Ilek-Vad 3
comes from his far realm on the twilight sea once a year in a golden palanqnin to 3
pray to the god of Oukianos, who sang to him in youth when he dwelt in a 3
cottage by its banks. All of jasper is that temple, and covering an acre of ground 3
with its walls and courts, its seven pinnacled towers, and its inner shrine where 3
the river enters through hidden channels and the god sings softly in the night. 3
Many times the moon hears strange music as it shines on those courts and 3
terraces and pinnacles, but whether that music be the song of the god or the 3
chant of the cryptical priests, none but the King of Ilek-Vad may say; for only he 3
had entered the temple or seen the priests. Now, in the drowsiness of day, that 3
carven and delicate fane was silent, and Carter heard only the murmur of the 3
great stream and the hum of the birds and bees as he walked onward under the 3
enchanted sun. 3
3
All that afternoon the pilgrim wandered on through perfumed meadows and in 3
the lee of gentle riverward hills bearing peaceful thatched cottages and the 3
shrines of amiable gods carven from jasper or chrysoberyl. Sometimes he walked 3
close to the bank of Oukianos and whistled to the sprightly and iridescent fish of 3
that crystal stream, and at other times he paused amidst the whispering rushes 3
and gazed at the great dark wood on the farther side, whose trees came down 3
clear to the water's edge. In former dreams he had seen quaint lumbering 3
buopoths come shyly out of that wood to drink, but now he could not glimpse 3
any. Once in a while he paused to watch a carnivorous fish catch a fishing bird, 3
which it lured to the water by showing its tempting scales in the sun, and 3
grasped by the beak with its enormous mouth as the winged hunter sought to 3
dart down upon it. 3
3
Toward evening he mounted a low grassy rise and saw before him flaming in the 3
sunset the thousand gilded spires of Thran. Lofty beyond belief are the alabaster 3
walls of that incredible city, sloping inward toward the top and wrought in one 3
solid piece by what means no man knows, for they are more ancient than 3
memory. Yet lofty as they are with their hundred gates and two hundred turrets, 3
the clustered towers within, all white beneath their golden spires, are loftier still; 3
so that men on the plain around see them soaring into the sky, sometimes 3
shining clear, sometimes caught at the top in tangles of cloud and mist, and 3
sometimes clouded lower down with their utmost pinnacles blazing free above 3
the vapours. And where Thran's gates open on the river are great wharves of 3
marble, with ornate galleons of fragrant cedar and calamander riding gently at 3
anchor, and strange bearded sailors sitting on casks and bales with the 3
hieroglyphs of far places. Landward beyond the walls lies the farm country, 3
where small white cottages dream between little hills, and narrow roads with 3
many stone bridges wind gracefully among streams and gardens. 3
3
3
3
470 3
3
3
3
Down through this verdant land Carter walked at evening, and saw twilight 3
float up from the river to the marvellous golden spires of Thran. And just at the 3
hour of dusk he came to the southern gate, and was stopped by a red-robed 3
sentry till he had told three dreams beyond belief, and proved himself a dreamer 3
worthy to walk up Thran's steep mysterious streets and linger in the bazaars 3
where the wares of the ornate galleons were sold. Then into that incredible city 3
he walked; through a wall so thick that the gate was a tunnel, and thereafter 3
amidst curved and undulant ways winding deep and narrow between the 3
heavenward towers. Lights shone through grated and balconied windows, 3
and,the sound of lutes and pipes stole timid from inner courts where marble 3
fountains bubbled. Carter knew his way, and edged down through darker streets 3
to the river, where at an old sea tavern he found the captains and seamen he had 3
known in myriad other dreams. There he bought his passage to Celephais on a 3
great green galleon, and there he stopped for the night after speaking gravely to 3
the venerable cat of that inn, who blinked dozing before an enormous hearth and 3
dreamed of old wars and forgotten gods. 3
3
In the morning Carter boarded the galleon bound for Celephais, and sat in the 3
prow as the ropes were cast off and the long sail down to the Cerenerian Sea 3
begun. For many leagues the banks were much as they were above Thran, with 3
now and then a curious temple rising on the farther hills toward the right, and a 3
drowsy village on the shore, with steep red roofs and nets spread in the sun. 3
Mindful of his search. Carter questioned all the mariners closely about those 3
whom they had met in the taverns of Celephais, asking the names and ways of 3
the strange men with long, narrow eyes, long-lobed ears, thin noses, and pointed 3
chins who came in dark ships from the north and traded onyx for the carved jade 3
and spun gold and little red singing birds of Celephais. Of these men the sailors 3
knew not much, save that they talked but seldom and spread a kind of awe 3
about them. 3
3
Their land, very far away, was called Inquanok, and not many people cared to go 3
thither because it was a cold twilight land, and said to be close to unpleasant 3
Leng; although high impassable mountains towered on the side where Leng was 3
thought to lie, so that none might say whether this evil plateau with its horrible 3
stone villages and unmentionable monastery were really there, or whether the 3
rumour were only a fear that timid people felt in the night when those 3
formidable barrier peaks loomed black against a rising moon. Certainly, men 3
reached Leng from very different oceans. Of other boundaries of Inquanok those 3
sailors had no notion, nor had they heard of the cold waste and unknown Kadath 3
save from vague unplaced report. And of the marvellous sunset city which 3
Carter sought they knew nothing at all. So the traveller asked no more of far 3
things, but bided his time till he might talk with those strange men from cold and 3
3
3
3
471 3
3
3
3
twilight Inquanok who are the seed of such gods as carved their features on 3
Ngranek. 3
3
Late in the day the galleon reached those bends of the river which traverse the 3
perfumed jungles of Kied. Here Carter wished he might disembark, for in those 3
tropic tangles sleep wondrous palaces of ivory, lone and unbroken, where once 3
dwelt fabulous monarchs of a land whose name is forgotten. Spells of the Elder 3
Ones keep those places unharmed and undecayed, for it is written that there may 3
one day be need of them again; and elephant caravans have glimpsed them from 3
afar by moonlight, though none dares approach them closely because of the 3
guardians to which their wholeness is due. But the ship swept on, and dusk 3
hushed the hum of the day, and the first stars above blinked answers to the early 3
fireflies on the banks as that jungle fell far behind, leaving only its fragrance as a 3
memory that it had been. And all through the night that galleon floated on past 3
mysteries unseen and unsuspected. Once a lookout reported fires on the hills to 3
the east, but the sleepy captain said they had better not be looked at too much, 3
since it was highly uncertain just who or what had lit them. 3
3
In the morning the river had broadened out greatly, and Carter saw by the 3
houses along the banks that they were close to the vast trading city of Hlanith on 3
the Cerenerian Sea. Here the walls are of rugged granite, and the houses 3
peakedly fantastic with beamed and plastered gables. The men of Hlanith are 3
more like those of the waking world than any others in dreamland; so that the 3
city is not sought except for barter, but is prized for the solid work of its artisans. 3
The wharves of Hlanith are of oak, and there the galleon made fast while the 3
captain traded in the taverns. Carter also went ashore, and looked curiously 3
upon the rutted streets where wooden ox carts lumbered and feverish merchants 3
cried their wares vacuously in the bazaars. The sea taverns were all close to the 3
wharves on cobbled lanes salted with the spray of high tides, and seemed 3
exceedingly ancient with their low black-beamed ceilings and casements of 3
greenish bull's-eye panes. Ancient sailors in those taverns talked much of distant 3
ports, and told many stories of the curious men from twilight Inquanok, but had 3
little to add to what the seamen of the galleon had told. Then at last, after much 3
unloading and loading, the ship set sail once more over the sunset sea, and the 3
high walls and gables of Hlanith grew less as the last golden light of day lent 3
them a wonder and beauty beyond any that men had given them. 3
3
Two nights and two days the galleon sailed over the Cerenerian Sea, sighting no 3
land and speaking but one other vessel. Then near sunset of the second day there 3
loomed up ahead the snowy peak of Aran with its gingko-trees swaying on the 3
lower slope, and Carter knew that they were come to the land of Ooth-Nargai 3
and the marvellous city of Celephais. Swiftly there came into sight the glittering 3
minarets of that fabulous town, and the untarnished marble walls with their 3
3
3
3
472 3
3
3
3
bronze statues, and the great stone bridge where Naraxa joins the sea. Then rose 3
the gentle hills behind the town, with their groves and gardens of asphodels and 3
the small shrines and cottages upon them; and far in the background the purple 3
ridge of the Tanarians, potent and mystical, behind which lay forbidden ways 3
into the waking world and toward other regions of dream. 3
3
The harbour was full of painted galleys, some of which were from the marble 3
cloud-city of Serannian, that lies in ethereal space beyond where the sea meets 3
the sky, and some of which were from more substantial parts of dreamland. 3
Among these the steersman threaded his way up to the spice-fragrant wharves, 3
where the galleon made fast in the dusk as the city's million lights began to 3
twinkle out over the water. Ever new seemed this deathless city of vision, for 3
here time has no power to tarnish or destroy. As it has always been is still the 3
turquoise of Nath-Horthath, and the eighty orchid-wreathed priests are the same 3
who builded it ten thousand years ago. Shining still is the bronze of the great 3
gates, nor are the onyx pavements ever worn or broken. And the great bronze 3
statues on the walls look down on merchants and camel drivers older than fable, 3
yet without one grey hair in their forked beards. 3
3
Carter did not once seek out the temple or the palace or the citadel, but stayed by 3
the seaward wall among traders and sailors. And when it was too late for 3
rumours and legends he sought out an ancient tavern he knew well, and rested 3
with dreams of the gods on unknown Kadath whom he sought. The next day he 3
searched all along the quays for some of the strange mariners of Inquanok, but 3
was told that none were now in port, their galley not being due from the north 3
for full two weeks. He found, however, one Thorabonian sailor who had been to 3
Inquanok and had worked in the onyx quarries of that twilight place; and this 3
sailor said there was certainly a descent to the north of the peopled region, which 3
everybody seemed to fear and shun. The Thorabonian opined that this desert led 3
around the utmost rim of impassable peaks into Leng's horrible plateau, and that 3
this was why men feared it; though he admitted there were other vague tales of 3
evil presences and nameless sentinels. Whether or not this could be the fabled 3
waste wherein unknown Kadath stands he did not know; but it seemed unlikely 3
that those presences and sentinels, if indeed they existed, were stationed for 3
nought. 3
3
On the following day Carter walked up the Street of the Pillars to the turquoise 3
temple and talked with the High-Priest. Though Nath-Horthath is chiefly 3
worshipped in Celephais, all the Great Ones are mentioned in diurnal prayers; 3
and the priest was reasonably versed in their moods. Like Atal in distant Ulthar, 3
he strongly advised against any attempts to see them; declaring that they are 3
testy and capricious, and subject to strange protection from the mindless Other 3
Gods from Outside, whose soul and messenger is the crawling chaos 3
3
3
3
473 3
3
3
3
Nyarlathotep. Their jealous hiding of the marvellous sunset city shewed clearly 3
that they did not wish Carter to reach it, and it was doubtful how they would 3
regard a guest whose object was to see them and plead before them. No man had 3
ever found Kadath in the past, and it might be just as well if none ever found it in 3
the future. Such rumours as were told about that onyx castle of the Great Ones 3
were not by any means reassuring. 3
3
Having thanked the orchid-crowned High-Priest, Carter left the temple and 3
sought out the bazaar of the sheep-butchers, where the old chief of Celephais' 3
cats dwelt sleek and contented. That grey and dignified being was sunning 3
himself on the onyx pavement, and extended a languid paw as his caller 3
approached. But when Carter repeated the passwords and introductions 3
furnished him by the old cat general of Ulthar, the furry patriarch became very 3
cordial and communicative; and told much of the secret lore known to cats on 3
the seaward slopes of Ooth-Nargai. Best of all, he repeated several things told 3
him furtively by the timid waterfront cats of Celephais about the men of 3
Inquanok, on whose dark ships no cat will go. 3
3
It seems that these men have an aura not of earth about them, though that is not 3
the reason why no cat will sail on their ships. The reason for this is that Inquanok 3
holds shadows which no cat can endure, so that in all that cold twilight realm 3
there is never a cheering purr or a homely mew. Whether it be because of things 3
wafted over the impassable peaks from hypothetical Leng, or because of things 3
filtering down from the chilly desert to the north, none may say; but it remains a 3
fact that in that far land there broods a hint of outer space which cats do not like, 3
and to which they are more sensitive than men. Therefore they will not go on the 3
dark ships that seek the basalt quays of Inquanok. 3
3
The old chief of the cats also told him where to find his friend King Kuranes, 3
who in Carter's latter dreams had reigned alternately in the rose-crystal Palace of 3
the Seventy Delights at Celephais and in the turreted cloud-castle of sky-floating 3
Serannian. It seemed that he could no more find content in those places, but had 3
formed a mighty longing for the English cliffs and downlands of his boyhood; 3
where in little dreaming villages England's old songs hover at evening behind 3
lattice windows, and where grey church towers peep lovely through the verdure 3
of distant valleys. He could not go back to these things in the waking world 3
because his body was dead; but he had done the next best thing and dreamed a 3
small tract of such countryside in the region east of the city where meadows roll 3
gracefully up from the sea-cliffs to the foot of the Tanarian Hills. There he dwelt 3
in a grey Gothic manor-house of stone looking on the sea, and tried to think it 3
was ancient Trevor Towers, where he was born and where thirteen generations 3
of his forefathers had first seen the light. And on the coast nearby he had built a 3
little Cornish fishing village with steep cobbled ways, settling therein such 3
3
3
3
474 3
3
3
3
people as had the most Enghsh faces, and seeking ever to teach them the dear 3
remembered accents of old Cornwall fishers. And in a valley not far off he had 3
reared a great Norman Abbey whose tower he could see from his window, 3
placing around it in the churchyard grey stones with the names of his ancestors 3
carved thereon, and with a moss somewhat like Old England's moss. For though 3
Kuranes was a monarch in the land of dream, with all imagined pomps and 3
marvels, splendours and beauties, ecstasies and delights, novelties and 3
excitements at his command, he would gladly have resigned forever the whole of 3
his power and luxury and freedom for one blessed day as a simple boy in that 3
pure and quiet England, that ancient, beloved England which had moulded his 3
being and of which he must always be immutably a part. 3
3
So when Carter bade that old grey chief of the cats adieu, he did not seek the 3
terraced palace of rose crystal but walked out the eastern gate and across the 3
daisied fields toward a peaked gable which he glimpsed through the oaks of a 3
park sloping up to the sea-cliffs. And in time he came to a great hedge and a gate 3
with a little brick lodge, and when he rang the bell there hobbled to admit him 3
no robed and annointed lackey of the palace, but a small stubby old man in a 3
smock who spoke as best he could in the quaint tones of far Cornwall. And 3
Carter walked up the shady path between trees as near as possible to England's 3
trees, and clumbed the terraces among gardens set out as in Queen Anne's time. 3
At the door, flanked by stone cats in the old way, he was met by a whiskered 3
butler in suitable livery; and was presently taken to the library where Kuranes, 3
Lord of Ooth-Nargai and the Sky around Serannian, sat pensive in a chair by the 3
window looking on his little seacoast village and wishing that his old nurse 3
would come in and scold him because he was not ready for that hateful lawn- 3
party at the vicar's, with the carriage waiting and his mother nearly out of 3
patience. 3
3
Kuranes, clad in a dressing gown of the sort favoured by London tailors in his 3
youth, rose eagerly to meet his guest; for the sight of an Anglo-Saxon from the 3
waking world was very dear to him, even if it was a Saxon from Boston, 3
Massachusetts, instead of from Cornwall. And for long they talked of old times, 3
having much to say because both were old dreamers and well versed in the 3
wonders of incredible places. Kuranes, indeed, had been out beyond the stars in 3
the ultimate void, and was said to be the only one who had ever returned sane 3
from such a voyage. 3
3
At length Carter brought up the subject of his quest, and asked of his host those 3
questions he had asked of so many others. Kuranes did not know where Kadath 3
was, or the marvellous sunset city; but he did know that the Great Ones were 3
very dangerous creatures to seek out, and that the Other Gods had strange ways 3
of protecting them from impertinent curiosity. He had learned much of the Other 3
3
3
3
475 3
3
3
3
Gods in distant parts of space, especially in that region where form does not 3
exist, and coloured gases study the innermost secrets. The violet gas S'ngac had 3
told him terrible things of the crawling chaos Nyarlathotep, and had warned him 3
never to approach the central void where the daemon sultan Azathoth gnaws 3
hungrily in the dark. 3
3
Altogether, it was not well to meddle with the Elder Ones; and if they 3
persistently denied all access to the marvellous sunset city, it were better not to 3
seek that city. 3
3
Kuranes furthermore doubted whether his guest would profit aught by coming 3
to the city even were he to gain it. He himself had dreamed and yearned long 3
years for lovely Celephais and the land of Ooth-Nargai, and for the freedom and 3
colour and high experience of life devoid of its chains, and conventions, and 3
stupidities. But now that he was come into that city and that land, and was the 3
king thereof, he found the freedom and the vividness all too soon worn out, and 3
monotonous for want of linkage with anything firm in his feelings and 3
memories. He was a king in Ooth-Nargai, but found no meaning therein, and 3
drooped always for the old familiar things of England that had shaped his youth. 3
All his kingdom would he give for the sound of Cornish church bells over the 3
downs, and all the thousand minarets of Celephais for the steep homely roofs of 3
the village near his home. So he told his guest that the unknown sunset city 3
might not hold quite that content he sought, and that perhaps it had better 3
remain a glorious and half-remembered dream. For he had visited Carter often in 3
the old waking days, and knew well the lovely New England slopes that had 3
given him birth. 3
3
At the last, he was very certain, the seeker would long only for the early 3
remembered scenes; the glow of Beacon Hill at evening, the tall steeples and 3
winding hill streets of quaint Kingsport, the hoary gambrel roofs of ancient and 3
witch-haunted Arkham, and the blessed meads and valleys where stone walls 3
rambled and white farmhouse gables peeped out from bowers of verdure. These 3
things he told Randolph Carter, but still the seeker held to his purpose. And in 3
the end they parted each with his own conviction, and Carter went back through 3
the bronze gate into Celephais and down the Street of Pillars to the old sea wall, 3
where he talked more with the mariners of far ports and waited for the dark ship 3
from cold and twilight Inquanok, whose strange-faced sailors and onyx-traders 3
had in them the blood of the Great Ones. 3
3
One starlit evening when the Pharos shone splendid over the harbour the 3
longed-for ship put in, and strange-faced sailors and traders appeared one by 3
one and group by group in the ancient taverns along the sea wall. It was very 3
exciting to see again those living faces so like the godlike features of Ngranek, 3
3
3
3
476 3
3
3
3
but Carter did not hasten to speak with the silent seamen. He did not know how 3
much of pride and secrecy and dim supernal memory might fill those children of 3
the Great Ones, and was sure it would not be wise to tell them of his quest or ask 3
too closely of that cold desert stretching north of their twilight land. They talked 3
little with the other folk in those ancient sea taverns; but would gather in groups 3
in remote comers and sing among themselves the haunting airs of unknown 3
places, or chant long tales to one another in accents alien to the rest of 3
dreamland. And so rare and moving were those airs and tales that one might 3
guess their wonders from the faces of those who listened, even though the words 3
came to common ears only as strange cadence and obscure melody. 3
3
For a week the strange seamen lingered in the taverns and traded in the bazaars 3
of Celephais, and before they sailed Carter had taken passage on their dark ship, 3
telling them that he was an old onyx miner and wishful to work in their quarries. 3
That ship was very lovey and cunningly wrought, being of teakwood with ebony 3
fittings and traceries of gold, and the cabin in which the traveller lodged had 3
hangings of silk and velvet. One morning at the turn of the tide the sails were 3
raised and the anchor lilted, and as Carter stood on the high stern he saw the 3
sunrise-blazing walls and bronze statues and golden minarets of ageless 3
Celephais sink into the distance, and the snowy peak of Mount Man grow 3
smaller and smaller. By noon there was nothing in sight save the gentle blue of 3
the Cerenerian Sea, with one painted galley afar off bound for that realm of 3
Serannian where the sea meets the sky. 3
3
And the night came with gorgeous stars, and the dark ship steered for Charles' 3
Wain and the Little Bear as they swung slowly round the pole. And the sailors 3
sang strange songs of unknown places, and they stole off one by one to the 3
forecastle while the wistful watchers murmured old chants and leaned over the 3
rail to glimpse the luminous fish playing in bowers beneath the sea. Carter went 3
to sleep at midnight, and rose in the glow of a young morning, marking that the 3
sun seemed farther south than was its wont. And all through that second day he 3
made progress in knowing the men of the ship, getting them little by little to talk 3
of their cold twilight land, of their exquisite onyx city, and of their fear of the 3
high and impassable peaks beyond which Leng was said to be. They told him 3
how sorry they were that no cats would stay in the land of Inquanok, and how 3
they thought the hidden nearness of Leng was to blame for it. Only of the stony 3
desert to the north they would not talk. There was something disquieting about 3
that desert, and it was thought expedient not to admit its existence. 3
3
On later days they talked of the quarries in which Carter said he was going to 3
work. There were many of them, for all the city of Inquanok was builded of 3
onyx, whilst great polished blocks of it were traded in Rinar, Ogrothan, and 3
Celephais and at home with the merchants of Thraa, Flarnek, and Kadatheron, 3
3
3
3
477 3
3
3
3
for the beautiful wares of those fabulous ports. And far to the north, almost in 3
the cold desert whose existence the men of Inquanok did not care to admit, there 3
was an unused quarry greater than all the rest; from which had been hewn in 3
forgotten times such prodigious lumps and blocks that the sight of their chiselled 3
vacancies struck terror to all who beheld. Who had mined those incredible 3
blocks, and whither they had been transported, no man might say; but it was 3
thought best not to trouble that quarry, around which such inhuman memories 3
might conceivably cling. So it was left all alone in the twilight, with only the 3
raven and the rumoured Shantak-bird to brood on its immensities, when Carter 3
heard of this quarry he was moved to deep thought, for he knew from old tales 3
that the Great Ones' castle atop unknown Kadath is of onyx. 3
3
Each day the sun wheeled lower and lower in the sky, and the mists overhead 3
grew thicker and thicker. And in two weeks there was not any sunlight at all, but 3
only a weird grey twilight shining through a dome of eternal cloud by day, and a 3
cold starless phosphorescence from the under side of that cloud by night. On the 3
twentieth day a great jagged rock in the sea was sighted from afar, the first land 3
glimpsed since Man's snowy peak had dwindled behind the ship. Carter asked 3
the captain the name of that rock, but was told that it had no name and had 3
never been sought by any vessel because of the sounds that came from it at night. 3
And when, after dark, a dull and ceaseless howling arose from that jagged 3
granite place, the traveller was glad that no stop had been made, and that the 3
rock had no name. The seamen prayed and chanted till the noise was out of 3
earshot, and Carter dreamed terrible dreams within dreams in the small hours. 3
3
Two mornings after that there loomed far ahead and to the east a line of great 3
grey peaks whose tops were lost in the changeless clouds of that twilight world. 3
And at the sight of them the sailors sang glad songs, and some knelt down on the 3
deck to pray, so that Carter knew they were come to the land of Inquanok and 3
would soon be moored to the basalt quays of the great town bearing that land's 3
name. Toward noon a dark coastline appeared, and before three o'clock there 3
stood out against the north the bulbous domes and fantastic spires of the onyx 3
city. Rare and curious did that archaic city rise above its walls and quays, all of 3
delicate black with scrolls, flutings, and arabesques of inlaid gold. Tall and 3
many-windowed were the houses, and carved on every side with flowers and 3
patterns whose dark symmetries dazzled the eye with a beauty more poignant 3
than light. Some ended in swelling domes that tapered to a point, others in 3
terraced pyramids whereon rose clustered minarets displaying every phase of 3
strangeness and imagination. The walls were low, and pierced by frequent gates, 3
each under a great arch rising high above the general level and capped by the 3
head of a god chiselled with that same skill displayed in the monstrous face on 3
distant Ngranek. On a hill in the centre rose a sixteen-angled tower greater than 3
all the rest and bearing a high pinnacled belfry resting on a flattened dome. This, 3
3
3
3
478 3
3
3
3
the seamen said, was the Temple of the Elder Ones, and was ruled by an old 3
High-Priest sad with inner secrets. 3
3
At intervals the clang of a strange bell shivered over the onyx city, answered 3
each time by a peal of mystic music made up of horns, viols, and chanting voices. 3
And from a row of tripods on a galley round the high dome of the temple there 3
burst flares of flame at certain moments; for the priests and people of that city 3
were wise in the primal mysteries, and faithful in keeping the rhythms of the 3
Great Ones as set forth in scrolls older than the Pnakotic Manuscripts. As the 3
ship rode past the great basalt breakwater into the harbour the lesser noises of 3
the city grew manifest, and Carter saw the slaves, sailors, and merchants on the 3
docks. The sailors and merchants were of the strange-faced race of the gods, but 3
the slaves were squat, slant-eyed folk said by rumour to have drifted somehow 3
across or around the impassable peaks from the valleys beyond Leng. The 3
wharves reached wide outside the city wall and bore upon them all manner of 3
merchandise from the galleys anchored there, while at one end were great piles 3
of onyx both carved and uncarved awaiting shipment to the far markets of Rinar, 3
Ograthan and Celephais. 3
3
It was not yet evening when the dark ship anchored beside a jutting quay of 3
stone, and all the sailors and traders filed ashore and through the arched gate 3
into the city. The streets of that city were paved with onyx and some of them 3
were wide and straight whilst others were crooked and narrow. The houses near 3
the water were lower than the rest, and bore above their curiously arched 3
doorways certain signs of gold said to be in honour of the respective small gods 3
that favoured each. The captain of the ship took Carter to an old sea tavern 3
where flocked the mariners of quaint countries, and promised that he would next 3
day shew him the wonders of the twilight city, and lead him to the taverns of the 3
onyx-miners by the northern wall. And evening fell, and little bronze lamps were 3
lighted, and the sailors in that tavern sang songs of remote places. But when 3
from its high tower the great bell shivered over the city, and the peal of the horns 3
and viols and voices rose cryptical in answer thereto, all ceased their songs or 3
tales and bowed silent till the. last echo died away. For there is a wonder and a 3
strangeness on the twilight city of Inquanok, and men fear to be lax in its rites 3
lest a doom and a vengeance lurk unsuspectedly close. 3
3
Far in the shadows of that tavern Carter saw a squat form he did not like, for it 3
was unmistakably that of the old slant-eyed merchant he had seen so long before 3
in the taverns of Dylath-Leen, who was reputed to trade with the horrible stone 3
villages of Leng which no healthy folk visit and whose evil fires are seen at night 3
from afar, and even to have dealt with that High-Priest Not To Be Described, 3
which wears a yellow silken mask over its face and dwells all alone in a 3
prehistoric stone monastery. This man had seemed to shew a queer gleam of 3
3
3
3
479 3
3
3
3
knowing when Carter asked the traders of DylathLeen about the cold waste and 3
Kadath; and somehow his presence in dark and haunted Inquanok, so close to 3
the wonders of the north, was not a reassuring thing. He slipped wholly out of 3
sight before Carter could speak to him, and sailors later said that he had come 3
with a yak caravan from some point not well determined, bearing the colossal 3
and rich-flavoured eggs of the rumoured Shantak-bird to trade for the dextrous 3
jade goblets that merchants brought from Ilarnek. 3
3
On the following morning the ship-captain led Carter through the onyx streets of 3
Inquanok, dark under their twilight sky. The inlaid doors and figured house- 3
fronts, carven balconies and crystal-paned oriels all gleamed with a sombre and 3
polished loveliness; and now and then a plaza would open out with black pillars, 3
colonades, and the statues of curious beings both human and fabulous. Some of 3
the vistas down long and unbending streets, or through side alleys and over 3
bulbous domes, spires, and arabesqued roofs, were weird and beautiful beyond 3
words; and nothing was more splendid than the massive heights of the great 3
central Temple of the Elder Ones with its sixteen carven sides, its flattened dome, 3
and its lofty pinnacled belfry, overtopping all else, and majestic whatever its 3
foreground. And always to the east, far beyond the city walls and the leagues of 3
pasture land, rose the gaunt grey sides of those topless and impassable peaks 3
across which hideous Leng was said to lie. 3
3
The captain took Carter to the mighty temple, which is set with its walled garden 3
in a great round plaza whence the streets go as spokes from a wheel's hub. The 3
seven arched gates of that garden, each having over it a carven face like those on 3
the city's gates, are always open, and the people roam reverently at will down 3
the tiled paths and through the little lanes lined with grotesque termini and the 3
shrines of modest gods. And there are fountains, pools, and basins there to 3
reflect the frequent blaze of the tripods on the high balcony, all of onyx and 3
having in them small luminous fish taken by divers from the lower bowers of 3
ocean. When the deep clang from the temple belfry shivers over the garden and 3
the city, and the answer of the horns and viols and voices peals out from the 3
seven lodges by the garden gates, there issue from the seven doors of the temple 3
long columns of masked and hooded priests in black, bearing at arm's length 3
before them great golden bowls from which a curious steam rises. And all the 3
seven columns strut peculiarly in single file, legs thrown far forward without 3
bending the knees, down the walks that lead to the seven lodges, wherein they 3
disappear and do not appear again. It is said that subterrene paths connect the 3
lodges with the temple, and that the long files of priests return through them; nor 3
is it unwhispered that deep flights of onyx steps go down to mysteries that are 3
never told. But only a few are those who hint that the priests in the masked and 3
hooded columns are not human beings. 3
3
3
3
480 3
3
3
3
Carter did not enter the temple, because none but the Veiled King is permitted to 3
do that. But before he left the garden the hour of the bell came, and he heard the 3
shivering clang deafening above him, and the wailing of the horns and viols and 3
voices loud from the lodges by the gates. And down the seven great walks 3
stalked the long files of bowl-bearing priests in their singular way, giving to the 3
traveller a fear which human priests do not often give. When the last of them had 3
vanished he left that garden, noting as he did so a spot on the pavement over 3
which the bowls had passed. Even the ship-captain did not like that spot, and 3
hurried him on toward the hill whereon the Veiled King's palace rises many- 3
domed and marvellous. 3
3
The ways to the onyx palace are steep and narrow, all but the broad curving one 3
where the king and his companions ride on yaks or in yak-drawn chariots. Carter 3
and his guide climbed up an alley that was all steps, between inlaid walls 3
hearing strange signs in gold, and under balconies and oriels whence sometimes 3
floated soft strains of music or breaths of exotic fragrance. Always ahead loomed 3
those titan walls, mighty buttresses, and clustered and bulbous domes for which 3
the Veiled King's palace is famous; and at length they passed under a great black 3
arch and emerged in the gardens of the monarch's pleasure. There Carter paused 3
in faintness at so much beauty, for the onyx terraces and colonnaded walks, the 3
gay porterres and delicate flowering trees espaliered to golden lattices, the 3
brazen urns and tripods with cunning bas-reliefs, the pedestalled and almost 3
breathing statues of veined black marble, the basalt-bottomed lagoon's tiled 3
fountains with luminous fish, the tiny temples of iridescent singing birds atop 3
carven columns, the marvellous scrollwork of the great bronze gates, and the 3
blossoming vines trained along every inch of the polished walls all joined to 3
form a sight whose loveliness was beyond reality, and half-fabulous even in the 3
land of dreams. There it shimmered like a vision under that grey twilight sky, 3
with the domed and fretted magnificence of the palace ahead, and the fantastic 3
silhouette of the distant impassable peaks on the right. And ever the small birds 3
and the fountains sang, while the perfume of rare blossoms spread like a veil 3
over that incredible garden. No other human presence was there, and Carter was 3
glad it was so. Then they turned and descended again the onyx alley of steps, for 3
the palace itself no visitor may enter; and it is not well to look too long and 3
steadily at the great central dome, since it is said to house the archaic father of all 3
the rumoured Shantak-birds, and to send out queer dreams to the curious. 3
3
After that the captain took Carter to the north quarter of the town, near the Gate 3
of the Caravans, where are the taverns of the yak-merchants and the onyx- 3
miners. And there, in a low-ceiled inn of quarrymen, they said farewell; for 3
business called the captain whilst Carter was eager to talk with miners about the 3
north. There were many men in that inn, and the traveller was not long in 3
speaking to some of them; saying that he was an old miner of onyx, and anxious 3
3
3
3
481 3
3
3
3
to know somewhat of Inquanok's quarries. But all that he learned was not much 3
more than he knew before, for the miners were timid and evasive about the cold 3
desert to the north and the quarry that no man visits. They had fears of fabled 3
emissaries from around the mountains where Leng is said to lie, and of evil 3
presences and nameless sentinels far north among the scattered rocks. And they 3
whispered also that the rumoured Shantak-birds are no wholesome things; it 3
being, indeed for the best that no man has ever truly seen one (for that fabled 3
father of Shantaks in the king's dome is fed in the dark). 3
3
The next day, saying that he wished to look over all the various mines for himself 3
and to visit the scattered farms and quaint onyx villages of Inquanok, Carter 3
hired a yak and stuffed great leathern saddle-bags for a journey. Beyond the Gate 3
of the Caravans the road lay straight betwixt tilled fields, with many odd 3
farmhouses crowned by low domes. At some of these houses the seeker stopped 3
to ask questions; once finding a host so austere and reticent, and so full of an 3
unplaced majesty like to that in the huge features on Ngranek, that he felt certain 3
he had come at last upon one of the Great Ones themselves, or upon one with 3
full nine-tenths of their blood, dwelling amongst men. And to that austere and 3
reticent cotter he was careful to speak very well of the gods, and to praise all the 3
blessings they had ever accorded him. 3
3
That night Carter camped in a roadside meadow beneath a great lygath-tree to 3
which he tied his yak, and in the morning resumed his northward pilgrimage. At 3
about ten o'clock he reached the small-domed village of Urg, where traders rest 3
and miners tell their tales, and paused in its taverns till noon. It is here that the 3
great caravan road turns west toward Selarn, but Carter kept on north by the 3
quarry road. All the afternoon he followed that rising road, which was somewhat 3
narrower than the great highway, and which now led through a region with 3
more rocks than tilled fields. And by evening the low hills on his left had risen 3
into sizable black cliffs, so that he knew he was close to the mining country. All 3
the while the great gaunt sides of the impassable mountains towered afar off at 3
his right, and the farther he went, the worse tales he heard of them from the 3
scattered farmers and traders and drivers of lumbering onyx-carts along the way. 3
3
On the second night he camped in the shadow of a large black crag, tethering his 3
yak to a stake driven in the ground. He observed the greater phosphorescence of 3
the clouds at his northerly point, and more than once thought he saw dark 3
shapes outlined against them. And on the third morning he came in sight of the 3
first onyx quarry, and greeted the men who there laboured with picks and 3
chisels. Before evening he had passed eleven quarries; the land being here given 3
over altogether to onyx cliffs and boulders, with no vegetation at all, but only 3
great rocky fragments scattered about a floor of black earth, with the grey 3
impassable peaks always rising gaunt and sinister on his right. The third night he 3
3
3
3
482 3
3
3
3
spent in a camp of quarry men whose flickering fires cast weird reflections on the 3
polished cliffs to the west. And they sang many songs and told many tales, 3
shewing such strange knowledge of the olden days and the habits of gods that 3
Carter could see they held many latent memories of their sires the Great Ones. 3
They asked him whither he went, and cautioned him not to go too far to the 3
north; but he replied that he was seeking new cliffs of onyx, and would take no 3
more risks than were common among prospectors. In the morning he bade them 3
adieu and rode on into the darkening north, where they had warned him he 3
would find the feared and unvisited quarry whence hands older than men's 3
hands had wrenched prodigious blocks. But he did not like it when, turning back 3
to wave a last farewell, he thought he saw approaching the camp that squat and 3
evasive old merchant with slanting eyes, whose conjectured traffick with Leng 3
was the gossip of distant Dylath-Leen. 3
3
After two more quarries the inhabited part of Inquanok seemed to end, and the 3
road narrowed to a steeply rising yak-path among forbidding black cliffs. 3
Always on the right towered the gaunt and distant peaks, and as Carter climbed 3
farther and farther into this untraversed realm he found it grew darker and 3
colder. Soon he perceived that there were no prints of feet or hooves on the black 3
path beneath, and realised that he was indeed come into strange and deserted 3
ways of elder time. Once in a while a raven would croak far overhead, and now 3
and then a flapping behind some vast rock would make him think 3
uncomfortably of the rumoured Shantak-bird. But in the main he was alone with 3
his shaggy steed, and it troubled him to observe that this excellent yak became 3
more and more reluctant to advance, and more and more disposed to snort 3
affrightedly at any small noise along the route. 3
3
The path now contracted between sable and glistening walls, and began to 3
display an even greater steepness than before. It was a bad footing, and the yak 3
often slipped on the stony fragments strewn thickly about. In two hours Carter 3
saw ahead a definite crest, beyond which was nothing but dull grey sky, and 3
blessed the prospect of a level or downward course. To reach this crest, however, 3
was no easy task; for the way had grown nearly perpendicular, and was perilous 3
with loose black gravel and small stones. Eventually Carter dismounted and led 3
his dubious yak; pulling very hard when the animal balked or stumbled, and 3
keeping his own footing as best he might. Then suddenly he came to the top and 3
saw beyond, and gasped at what he saw. 3
3
The path indeed led straight ahead and slightly down, with the same lines of 3
high natural walls as before; but on the left hand there opened out a monstrous 3
space, vast acres in extent, where some archaic power had riven and rent the 3
native cliffs of onyx in the form of a giant's quarry. Far back into the solid 3
precipice ran that Cyclopean gouge, and deep down within earth's bowels its 3
3
3
3
483 3
3
3
3
lower delvings yawned. It was no quarry of man, and the concave sides were 3
scarred with great squares, yards wide, which told of the size of the blocks once 3
hewn by nameless hands and chisels. High over its jagged rim huge ravens 3
flapped and croaked, and vague whirrings in the unseen depths told of bats or 3
urhags or less mentionable presences haunting the endless blackness. There 3
Carter stood in the narrow way amidst the twilight with the rocky path sloping 3
down before him; tall onyx cliffs on his right that led on as far as he could see 3
and tall cliffs on the left chopped off just ahead to make that terrible and 3
unearthly quarry. 3
3
All at once the yak uttered a cry and burst from his control, leaping past him and 3
darting on in a panic till it vanished down the narrow slope toward the north. 3
Stones kicked by its flying hooves fell over the brink of the quarry and lost 3
themselves in the dark without any sound of striking bottom; but Carter ignored 3
the perils of that scanty path as he raced breathlessly after the flying steed. Soon 3
the left-behind cliffs resumed their course, making the way once more a narrow 3
lane; and still the traveller leaped on after the yak whose great wide prints told 3
of its desperate flight. 3
3
Once he thought he heard the hoofbeats of the frightened beast, and doubled his 3
speed from this encouragement. He was covering miles, and little by little the 3
way was broadening in front till he knew he must soon emerge on the cold and 3
dreaded desert to the north. The gaunt grey flanks of the distant impassable 3
peaks were again visible above the right-hand crags, and ahead were the rocks 3
and boulders of an open space which was clearly a foretaste of the dark arid 3
limitless plain. And once more those hoofbeats sounded in his ears, plainer than 3
before, but this time giving terror instead of encouragement because he realised 3
that they were not the frightened hoofbeats of his fleeing yak. The beats were 3
ruthless and purposeful, and they were behind him. 3
3
Carter's pursuit of the yak became now a flight from an unseen thing, for though 3
he dared not glance over his shoulder he felt that the presence behind him could 3
be nothing wholesome or mentionable. His yak must have heard or felt it first, 3
and he did not like to ask himself whether it had followed him from the haunts 3
of men or had floundered up out of that black quarry pit. Meanwhile the cliffs 3
had been left behind, so that the oncoming night fell over a great waste of sand 3
and spectral rocks wherein all paths were lost. He could not see the hoofprints of 3
his yak, but always from behind him there came that detestable clopping; 3
mingled now and then with what he fancied were titanic flappings and 3
whirrings. That he was losing ground seemed unhappily clear to him, and he 3
knew he was hopelessly lost in this broken and blasted desert of meaningless 3
rocks and untravelled sands. Only those remote and impassable peaks on the 3
3
3
3
484 3
3
3
3
right gave him any sense of direction, and even they were less clear as the grey 3
twilight waned and the sickly phosphorescence of the clouds took its place. 3
3
Then dim and misty in the darkling north before him he glimpsed a terrible 3
thing. He had thought it for some moments a range of black mountains, but now 3
he saw it was something more. The phosphorescence of the brooding clouds 3
shewed it plainly, and even silhouetted parts of it as vapours glowed behind. 3
How distant it was he could not tell, but it must have been very far. It was 3
thousands of feet high, stretching in a great concave arc from the grey 3
impassable peaks to the unimagined westward spaces, and had once indeed been 3
a ridge of mighty onyx hills. But now these hills were hills no more, for some 3
hand greater than man's had touched them. Silent they squatted there atop the 3
world like wolves or ghouls, crowned with clouds and mists and guarding the 3
secrets of the north forever. All in a great half circle they squatted, those dog-like 3
mountains carven into monstrous watching statues, and their right hands were 3
raised in menace against mankind. 3
3
It was only the flickering light of the clouds that made their mitred double heads 3
seem to move, but as Carter stumbled on he saw arise from their shadowy caps 3
great forms whose motions were no delusion. Winged and whirring, those forms 3
grew larger each moment, and the traveller knew his stumbling was at an end. 3
They were not any birds or bats known elsewhere on earth or in dreamland, for 3
they were larger than elephants and had heads like a horse's. Carter knew that 3
they must be the Shantak-birds of ill rumour, and wondered no more what evil 3
guardians and nameless sentinels made men avoid the boreal rock desert. And as 3
he stopped in final resignation he dared at last to look behind him, where indeed 3
was trotting the squat slant-eyed trader of evil legend, grinning astride a lean 3
yak and leading on a noxious horde of leering Shantaks to whose wings still 3
clung the rime and nitre of the nether pits. 3
3
Trapped though he was by fabulous and hippocephalic winged nightmares that 3
pressed around in great unholy circles, Randolph Carter did not lose 3
consciousness. Lofty and horrible those titan gargoyles towered above him, 3
while the slant-eyed merchant leaped down from his yak and stood grinning 3
before the captive. Then the man motioned Carter to mount one of the repugnant 3
Shantaks, helping him up as his judgement struggled with his loathing. It was 3
hard work ascending, for the Shantak-bird has scales instead of feathers, and 3
those scales are very slippery. Once he was seated, the slant-eyed man hopped 3
up behind him, leaving the lean yak to be led away northward toward the ring of 3
carven mountains by one of the incredible bird colossi. 3
3
There now followed a hideous whirl through frigid space, endlessly up and 3
eastward toward the gaunt grey flanks of those impassable mountains beyond 3
3
3
3
485 3
3
3
3
which Leng was said to be. Far above the clouds they flew, till at last there lay 3
beneath them those fabled summits which the folk of Inquanok have never seen, 3
and which lie always in high vortices of gleaming mist. Carter beheld them very 3
plainly as they passed below, and saw upon their topmost peaks strange caves 3
which made him think of those on Ngranek; but he did not question his captor 3
about these things when he noticed that both the man and the horse-headed 3
Shantak appeared oddly fearful of them, hurrying past nervously and shewing 3
great tension until they were left far in the rear. 3
3
The Shantak now flew lower, revealing beneath the canopy of cloud a grey 3
barren plain whereon at great distances shone little feeble fires. As they 3
descended there appeared at intervals lone huts of granite and bleak stone 3
villages whose tiny windows glowed with pallid light. And there came from 3
those huts and villages a shrill droning of pipes and a nauseous rattle of crotala 3
which proved at once that Inquanok's people are right in their geographic 3
rumours. For travellers have heard such sounds before, and know that they float 3
only from the cold desert plateau which healthy folk never visit; that haunted 3
place of evil and mystery which is Leng. 3
3
Around the feeble fires dark forms were dancing, and Carter was curious as to 3
what manner of beings they might be; for no healthy folk have ever been to Leng, 3
and the place is known only by its fires and stone huts as seen from afar. Very 3
slowly and awkwardly did those forms leap, and with an insane twisting and 3
bending not good to behold; so that Carter did not wonder at the monstrous evil 3
imputed to them by vague legend, or the fear in which all dreamland holds their 3
abhorrent frozen plateau. As the Shantak flew lower, the repulsiveness of the 3
dancers became tinged with a certain hellish familiarity; and the prisoner kept 3
straining his eyes and racking his memory for clues to where he had seen such 3
creatures before. 3
3
They leaped as though they had hooves instead of feet, and seemed to wear a 3
sort of wig or headpiece with small horns. Of other clothing they had none, but 3
most of them were quite furry. Behind they had dwarfish tails, and when they 3
glanced upward he saw the excessive width of their mouths. Then he knew what 3
they were, and that they did not wear any wigs or headpieces after all. For the 3
cryptic folk of Leng were of one race with the uncomfortable merchants of the 3
black galleys that traded rubies at Dylath-Leen; those not quite human 3
merchants who are the slaves of the monstrous moon-things! They were indeed 3
the same dark folk who had shanghaied Carter on their noisome galley so long 3
ago, and whose kith he had seen driven in herds about the unclean wharves of 3
that accursed lunar city, with the leaner ones toiling and the fatter ones taken 3
away in crates for other needs of their polypous and amorphous masters. Now 3
he saw where such ambiguous creatures came from, and shuddered at the 3
3
3
3
486 3
3
3
3
thought that Leng must be known to these formless abominations from the 3
moon. 3
3
But the Shantak flew on past the fires and the stone huts and the less than human 3
dancers, and soared over sterile hills of grey granite and dim wastes of rock and 3
ice and snow. Day came, and the phosphorescence of low clouds gave place to 3
the misty twilight of that northern world, and still the vile bird winged 3
meaningly through the cold and silence. At times the slant-eyed man talked with 3
his steed in a hateful and guttural language, and the Shantak would answer with 3
tittering tones that rasped like the scratching of ground glass. All this while the 3
land was getting higher, and finally they came to a wind-swept table-land which 3
seemed the very roof of a blasted and tenantless world. There, all alone in the 3
hush and the dusk and the cold, rose the uncouth stones of a squat windowless 3
building, around which a circle of crude monoliths stood. In all this arrangement 3
there was nothing human, and Carter surmised from old tales that he was indeed 3
come to that most dreadful and legendary of all places, the remote and 3
prehistoric monastery wherein dwells uncompanioned the High-Priest Not To Be 3
Described, which wears a yellow silken mask over its face and prays to the Other 3
Gods and their crawling chaos Nyarlathotep. 3
3
The loathsome bird now settled to the ground, and the slant-eyed man hopped 3
down and helped his captive alight. Of the purpose of his seizure Carter now felt 3
very sure; for clearly the slant-eyed merchant was an agent of the darker powers, 3
eager to drag before his masters a mortal whose presumption had aimed at the 3
finding of unknown Kadath and the saying of a prayer before the faces of the 3
Great Ones in their onyx castle. It seemed likely that this merchant had caused 3
his former capture by the slaves of the moon-things in Dylath-Leen, and that he 3
now meant to do what the rescuing cats had baffled; taking the victim to some 3
dread rendezvous with monstrous Nyarlathotep and telling with what boldness 3
the seeking of unknown Kadath had been tried. Leng and the cold waste north of 3
Inquanok must be close to the Other Gods, and there the passes to Kadath are 3
well guarded. 3
3
The slant-eyed man was small, but the great hippocephalic bird was there to see 3
he was obeyed; so Carter followed where he led, and passed within the circle of 3
standing rocks and into the low arched doorway of that windowless stone 3
monastery. There were no lights inside, but the evil merchant lit a small clay 3
lamp bearing morbid bas-reliefs and prodded his prisoner on through mazes of 3
narrow winding corridors. On the walls of the corridors were printed frightful 3
scenes older than history, and in a style unknown to the archaeologists of earth. 3
After countless aeons their pigments were brilliant still, for the cold and dryness 3
of hideous Leng keep alive many primal things. Carter saw them fleetingly in the 3
rays of that dim and moving lamp, and shuddered at the tale they told. 3
3
3
3
487 3
3
3
3
Through those archaic frescoes Leng's annals stalked; and the horned, hooved, 3
and wide-mouthed almost-humans danced evilly amidst forgotten cities. There 3
were scenes of old wars, wherein Leng's almost-humans fought with the bloated 3
purple spiders of the neighbouring vales; and there were scenes also of the 3
coming of the black galleys from the moon, and of the submission of Leng's 3
people to the polypous and amorphous blasphemies that hopped and floundered 3
and wriggled out of them. Those slippery greyish-white blasphemies they 3
worshipped as gods, nor ever complained when scores of their best and fatted 3
males were taken away in the black galleys. The monstrous moon-beasts made 3
their camp on a jagged isle in the sea, and Carter could tell from the frescoes that 3
this was none other than the lone nameless rock he had seen when sailing to 3
Inquanok; that grey accursed rock which Inquanok's seamen shun, and from 3
which vile bowlings reverberate all through the night. 3
3
And in those frescoes was shewn the great seaport and capital of the almost- 3
humans; proud and pillared betwixt the cliffs and the basalt wharves, and 3
wondrous with high fanes and carven places. Great gardens and columned 3
streets led from the cliffs and from each of the six sphinx-crowned gates to a vast 3
central plaza, and in that plaza was a pair of winged colossal lions guarding the 3
top of a subterrene staircase. Again and again were those huge winged lions 3
shewn, their mighty flanks of diarite glistening in the grey twilight of the day 3
and the cloudy phosphorescence of the night. And as Carter stumbled past their 3
frequent and repeated pictures it came to him at last what indeed they were, and 3
what city it was that the almost-humans had ruled so anciently before the 3
coming of the black galleys. There could be no mistake, for the legends of 3
dreamland are generous and profuse. Indubitably that primal city was no less a 3
place than storied Sarkomand, whose ruins had bleached for a million years 3
before the first true human saw the light, and whose twin titan lions guard 3
eternally the steps that lead down from dreamland to the Great Abyss. 3
3
Other views shewed the gaunt grey peaks dividing Leng from Inquanok, and the 3
monstrous Shantak-birds that build nests on the ledges half way up. And they 3
shewed likewise the curious caves near the very topmost pinnacles, and how 3
even the boldest of the Shantaks fly screaming away from them. Carter had seen 3
those caves when he passed over them, and had noticed their likeness to the 3
caves on Ngranek. Now he knew that the likeness was more than a chance one, 3
for in these pictures were shewn their fearsome denizens; and those bat-wings, 3
curving horns, barbed tails, prehensile paws and rubbery bodies were not 3
strange to him. He had met those silent, flitting and clutching creatures before; 3
those mindless guardians of the Great Abyss whom even the Great Ones fear, 3
and who own not Nyarlathotep but hoary Nodens as their lord. For they were 3
the dreaded night-gaunts, who never laugh or smile because they have no faces. 3
3
3
3
488 3
3
3
3
and who flop unendingly in the dark betwixt the Vale of Pnath and the passes to 3
the outer world. 3
3
The slant-eyed merchant had now prodded Carter into a great domed space 3
whose walls were carved in shocking bas-reliefs, and whose centre held a gaping 3
circular pit surrounded by six malignly stained stone altars in a ring. There was 3
no light in this vast evil-smelling crypt, and the small lamp of the sinister 3
merchant shone so feebly that one could grasp details only little by little. At the 3
farther end was a high stone dais reached by five steps; and there on a golden 3
throne sat a lumpish figure robed in yellow silk figured with red and having a 3
yellow silken mask over its face. To this being the slant-eyed man made certain 3
signs with his hands, and the lurker in the dark replied by raising a disgustingly 3
carven flute of ivory in silk-covered paws and blowing certain loathsome sounds 3
from beneath its flowing yellow mask. This colloquy went on for some time, and 3
to Carter there was something sickeningly familiar in the sound of that flute and 3
the stench of the malodorous place. It made him think of a frightful red-litten city 3
and of the revolting procession that once filed through it; of that, and of an awful 3
climb through lunar countryside beyond, before the rescuing rush of earth's 3
friendly cats. He knew that the creature on the dais was without doubt the High- 3
Priest Not To Be Described, of which legend whispers such fiendish and 3
abnormal possibilities, but he feared to think just what that abhorred High-Priest 3
might be. 3
3
Then the figured silk slipped a trifle from one of the greyish-white paws, and 3
Carter knew what the noisome High-Priest was. And in that hideous second, 3
stark fear drove him to something his reason would never have dared to attempt, 3
for in all his shaken consciousness there was room only for one frantic will to 3
escape from what squatted on that golden throne. He knew that hopeless 3
labyrinths of stone lay betwixt him and the cold table-land outside, and that even 3
on that table-land the noxious Shantek still waited; yet in spite of all this there 3
was in his mind only the instant need to get away from that wriggling, silk-robed 3
monstrosity. 3
3
The slant-eyed man had set the curious lamp upon one of the high and wickedly 3
stained altar-stones by the pit, and had moved forward somewhat to talk to the 3
High-Priest with his hands. Carter, hitherto wholly passive, now gave that man a 3
terrific push with all the wild strength of fear, so that the victim toppled at once 3
into that gaping well which rumour holds to reach down to the hellish Vaults of 3
Zin where Gugs hunt ghasts in the dark. In almost the same second he seized the 3
lamp from the altar and darted out into the frescoed labyrinths, racing this way 3
and that as chance determined and trying not to think of the stealthy padding of 3
shapeless paws on the stones behind him, or of the silent wrigglings and 3
crawlings which must be going on back there in lightless corridors. 3
3
3
3
489 3
3
3
3
After a few moments he regretted his thoughtless haste, and wished he had tried 3
to follow backward the frescoes he had passed on the way in. True, they were so 3
confused and duplicated that they could not have done him much good, but he 3
wished none the less he had made the attempt. Those he now saw were even 3
more horrible than those he had seen then, and he knew he was not in the 3
corridors leading outside. In time he became quite sure he was not followed, and 3
slackened his pace somewhat; but scarce had he breathed in half relief when a 3
new peril beset him. His lamp was waning, and he would soon be in pitch 3
blackness with no means of sight or guidance. 3
3
When the light was all gone he groped slowly in the dark, and prayed to the 3
Great Ones for such help as they might afford. At times he felt the stone floor 3
sloping up or down, and once he stumbled over a step for which no reason 3
seemed to exist. The farther he went the damper it seemed to be, and when he 3
was able to feel a junction or the mouth of a side passage he always chose the 3
way which sloped downward the least. He believed, though, that his general 3
course was down; and the vault-like smell and incrustations on the greasy walls 3
and floor alike warned him he was burrowing deep in Leng's unwholesome 3
table-land. But there was not any warning of the thing which came at last; only 3
the thing itself with its terror and shock and breath-taking chaos. One moment he 3
was groping slowly over the slippery floor of an almost level place, and the next 3
he was shooting dizzily downward in the dark through a burrow which must 3
have been well-nigh vertical. 3
3
Of the length of that hideous sliding he could never be sure, but it seemed to take 3
hours of delirious nausea and ecstatic frenzy. Then he realized he was still, with 3
the phosphorescent clouds of a northern night shining sickly above him. All 3
around were crumbling walls and broken columns, and the pavement on which 3
he lay was pierced by straggling grass and wrenched asunder by frequent shrubs 3
and roots. Behind him a basalt cliff rose topless and perpendicular; its dark side 3
sculptured into repellent scenes, and pierced by an arched and carven entrance 3
to the inner blacknesses out of which he had come. Ahead stretched double rows 3
of pillars, and the fragments and pedestals of pillars, that spoke of a broad and 3
bygone street; and from the urns and basins along the way he knew it had been a 3
great street of gardens. Far off at its end the pillars spread to mark a vast round 3
plaza, and in that open circle there loomed gigantic under the lurid night clouds 3
a pair of monstrous things. Huge winged lions of diarite they were, with 3
blackness and shadow between them. Full twenty feet they reared their 3
grotesque and unbroken heads, and snarled derisive on the ruins around them. 3
And Carter knew right well what they must be, for legend tells of only one such 3
twain. They were the changeless guardians of the Great Abyss, and these dark 3
ruins were in truth primordial Sarkomand. 3
3
3
3
490 3
3
3
3
Carter's first act was to close and barricade the archway in the cHff with fallen 3
blocks and odd debris that lay around. He wished no follower from Leng's 3
hateful monastery, for along the way ahead would lurk enough of other dangers. 3
Of how to get from Sarkomand to the peopled parts of dreamland he knew 3
nothing at all; nor could he gain much by descending to the grottoes of the 3
ghouls, since he knew they were no better informed than he. The three ghouls 3
which had helped him through the city of Gugs to the outer world had not 3
known how to reach Sarkomand in their journey back, but had planned to ask 3
old traders in Dylath-Leen. He did not like to think of going again to the 3
subterrene world of Gugs and risking once more that hellish tower of Koth with 3
its Cyclopean steps leading to the enchanted wood, yet he felt he might have to 3
try this course if all else failed. Over Leng's plateau past the lone monastery he 3
dared not go unaided; for the High-Priest's emissaries must be many, while at 3
the journey's end there would no doubt be the Shantaks and perhaps other 3
things to deal with. If he could get a boat he might sail back to Inquanok past the 3
jagged and hideous rock in the sea, for the primal frescoes in the monastery 3
labyrinth had shewn that this frightful place lies not far from Sarkomand's basalt 3
quays. But to find a boat in this aeon-deserted city was no probable thing, and it 3
did not appear likely that he could ever make one. 3
3
Such were the thoughts of Randolph Carter when a new impression began 3
beating upon his mind. All this while there had stretched before him the great 3
corpse-like width of fabled Sarkomand with its black broken pillars and 3
crumbling sphinx-crowned gates and titan stones and monstrous winged lions 3
against the sickly glow of those luminous night clouds. Now he saw far ahead 3
and on the right a glow that no clouds could account for, and knew he was not 3
alone in the silence of that dead city. The glow rose and fell fitfully, flickering 3
with a greenish tinge which did not reassure the watcher. And when he crept 3
closer, down the littered street and through some narrow gaps between tumbled 3
walls, he perceived that it was a campfire near the wharves with many vague 3
forms clustered darkly around it; and a lethal odour hanging heavily over all. 3
Beyond was the oily lapping of the harbour water with a great ship riding at 3
anchor, and Carter paused in stark terror when he saw that the ship was indeed 3
one of the dreaded black galleys from the moon. 3
3
Then, just as he was about to creep back from that detestable flame, he saw a 3
stirring among the vague dark forms and heard a peculiar and unmistakable 3
sound. It was the frightened meeping of a ghoul, and in a moment it had swelled 3
to a veritable chorus of anguish. Secure as he was in the shadow of monstrous 3
ruins. Carter allowed his curiosity to conquer his fear, and crept forward again 3
instead of retreating. Once in crossing an open street he wriggled worm-like on 3
his stomach, and in another place he had to rise to his feet to avoid making a 3
noise among heaps of fallen marble. But always he succeeded in avoiding 3
3
3
3
491 3
3
3
3
discovery, so that in a short time he had found a spot behind a titan pillar where 3
he could watch the whole green-litten scene of action. There around a hideous 3
fire fed by the obnoxious stems of lunar fungi, there squatted a stinking circle of 3
the toadlike moonbeasts and their almost-human slaves. Some of these slaves 3
were heating curious iron spears in the leaping flames, and at intervals applying 3
their white-hot points to three tightly trussed prisoners that lay writhing before 3
the leaders of the party. From the motions of their tentacles Carter could see that 3
the blunt-snouted moonbeasts were enjoying the spectacle hugely, and vast was 3
his horror when he suddenly recognised the frantic meeping and knew that the 3
tortured ghouls were none other than the faithful trio which had guided him 3
safely from the abyss, and had thereafter set out from the enchanted wood to 3
find Sarkomand and the gate to their native deeps. 3
3
The number of malodorous moonbeasts about that greenish fire was very great, 3
and Carter saw that he could do nothing now to save his former allies. Of how 3
the ghouls had been captured he could not guess; but fancied that the grey 3
toadlike blasphemies had heard them inquire in Dylath-Leen concerning the way 3
to Sarkomand and had not wished them to approach so closely the hateful 3
plateau of Leng and the High-Priest Not To Be Described. For a moment he 3
pondered on what he ought to do, and recalled how near he was to the gate of 3
the ghouls' black kingdom. Clearly it was wisest to creep east to the plaza of twin 3
lions and descend at once to the gulf, where assuredly he would meet no horrors 3
worse than those above, and where he might soon find ghouls eager to rescue 3
their brethren and perhaps to wipe out the moonbeasts from the black galley. It 3
occurred to him that the portal, like other gates to the abyss, might be guarded 3
by flocks of night-gaunts; but he did not fear these faceless creatures now. He 3
had learned that they are bound by solemn treaties with the ghouls, and the 3
ghoul which was Pickman had taught him how to glibber a password they 3
understood. 3
3
So Carter began another silent crawl through the ruins, edging slowly toward the 3
great central plaza and the winged lions. It was ticklish work, but the 3
moonbeasts were pleasantly busy and did not hear the slight noises which he 3
twice made by accident among the scattered stones. At last he reached the open 3
space and picked his way among the stunned trees and vines that had grown up 3
therein. The gigantic lions loomed terrible above him in the sickly glow of the 3
phosphorescent night clouds, but he manfully persisted toward them and 3
presently crept round to their faces, knowing it was on that side he would find 3
the mighty darkness which they guard. Ten feet apart crouched the mocking- 3
faced beasts of diarite, brooding on cyclopean pedestals whose sides were 3
chiselled in fearsome bas-reliefs. Betwixt them was a tiled court with a central 3
space which had once been railed with balusters of onyx. Midway in this space a 3
black well opened, and Carter soon saw that he had indeed reached the yawning 3
3
3
3
492 3
3
3
3
gulf whose crusted and mouldy stone steps lead down to the crypts of 3
nightmare. 3
3
Terrible is the memory of that dark descent in which hours wore themselves 3
away whilst Carter wound sightlessly round and round down a fathomless 3
spiral of steep and slippery stairs. So worn and narrow were the steps, and so 3
greasy with the ooze of inner earth, that the climber never quite knew when to 3
expect a breathless fall and hurtling down to the ultimate pits; and he was 3
likewise uncertain just when or how the guardian night-gaunts would suddenly 3
pounce upon him, if indeed there were any stationed in this primeval passage. 3
All about him was a stifling odour of nether gulfs, and he felt that the air of these 3
choking depths was not made for mankind. In time he became very numb and 3
somnolent, moving more from automatic impulse than from reasoned will; nor 3
did he realize any change when he stopped moving altogether as something 3
quietly seized him from behind. He was flying very rapidly through the air 3
before a malevolent tickling told him that the rubbery night-gaunts had 3
performed their duty. 3
3
Awaked to the fact that he was in the cold, damp clutch of the faceless flutterers. 3
Carter remembered the password of the ghouls and glibbered it as loudly as he 3
could amidst the wind and chaos of flight. Mindless though night-gaunts are 3
said to be, the effect was instantaneous; for all tickling stopped at once, and the 3
creatures hastened to shift their captive to a more comfortable position. Thus 3
encouraged Carter ventured some explanations; telling of the seizure and torture 3
of three ghouls by the moonbeasts, and of the need of assembling a party to 3
rescue them. The night-gaunts, though inarticulate, seemed to understand what 3
was said; and shewed greater haste and purpose in their flight. Suddenly the 3
dense blackness gave place to the grey twilight of inner earth, and there opened 3
up ahead one of those flat sterile plains on which ghouls love to squat and gnaw. 3
Scattered tombstones and osseous fragments told of the denizens of that place; 3
and as Carter gave a loud meep of urgent summons, a score of burrows emptied 3
forth their leathery, dog-like tenants. The night-gaunts now flew low and set 3
their passenger upon his feet, afterward withdrawing a little and forming a 3
hunched semicircle on the ground while the ghouls greeted the newcomer. 3
3
Carter glibbered his message rapidly and explicitly to the grotesque company, 3
and four of them at once departed through different burrows to spread the news 3
to others and gather such troops as might be available for a rescue. After a long 3
wait a ghoul of some importance appeared, and made significant signs to the 3
night-gaunts, causing two of the latter to fly off into the dark. Thereafter there 3
were constant accessions to the hunched flock of night-gaunts on the plain, till at 3
length the slimy soil was fairly black with them. Meanwhile fresh ghouls crawled 3
out of the burrows one by one, all glibbering excitedly and forming in crude 3
3
3
3
493 3
3
3
3
battle array not far from the huddled night-gaunts. In time there appeared that 3
proud and influential ghoul which was once the artist Richard Pickman of 3
Boston, and to him Carter glibbered a very full account of what had occurred. 3
The erstwhile Pickman, pleased to greet his ancient friend again, seemed very 3
much impressed, and held a conference with other chiefs a little apart from the 3
growing throng. 3
3
Finally, after scanning the ranks with care, the assembled chiefs all meeped in 3
unison and began glibbering orders to the crowds of ghouls and night-gaunts. A 3
large detachment of the horned flyers vanished at once, while the rest grouped 3
themselves two by two on their knees with extended forelegs, awaiting the 3
approach of the ghouls one by one. As each ghoul reached the pair of night- 3
gaunts to which he was assigned, he was taken up and borne away into the 3
blackness; till at last the whole throng had vanished save for Carter, Pickman, 3
and the other chiefs, and a few pairs of night-gaunts. Pickman explained that 3
night-gaunts are the advance guard and battle steeds of the ghouls, and that the 3
army was issuing forth to Sarkomand to deal with the moonbeasts. Then Carter 3
and the ghoulish chiefs approached the waiting bearers and were taken up by 3
the damp, slippery paws. Another moment and all were whirling in wind and 3
darkness; endlessly up, up, up to the gate of the winged and the special ruins of 3
primal Sarkomand. 3
3
When, after a great interval. Carter saw again the sickly light of Sarkomand's 3
nocturnal sky, it was to behold the great central plaza swarming with militant 3
ghouls and night-gaunts. Day, he felt sure, must be almost due; but so strong 3
was the army that no surprise of the enemy would be needed. The greenish flare 3
near the wharves still glimmered faintly, though the absence of ghoulish 3
meeping shewed that the torture of the prisoners was over for the nonce. Softly 3
glibbering directions to their steeds and to the flock of riderless night-gaunts 3
ahead, the ghouls presently rose in wide whirring columns and swept on over 3
the bleak ruins toward the evil flame. Carter was now beside Pickman in the 3
front rank of ghouls, and saw as they approached the noisome camp that the 3
moonbeasts were totally unprepared. The three prisoners lay bound and inert 3
beside the fire, while their toadlike captors slumped drowsily about in no certain 3
order. The almost-human slaves were asleep, even the sentinels shirking a duty 3
which in this realm must have seemed to them merely perfunctory. 3
3
The final swoop of the night-gaunts and mounted ghouls was very sudden, each 3
of the greyish toadlike blasphemies and their almost-human slaves being seized 3
by a group of night-gaunts before a sound was made. The moonbeasts, of course, 3
were voiceless; and even the slaves had little chance to scream before rubbery 3
paws choked them into silence. Horrible were the writhings of those great 3
jellyfish abnormalities as the sardonic night-gaunts clutched them, but nothing 3
3
3
3
494 3
3
3
3
availed against the strength of those black prehensile talons. When a moonbeast 3
writhed too violently, a night-gaunt would seize and pull its quivering pink 3
tentacles; which seemed to hurt so much that the victim would cease its 3
struggles. Carter expected to see much slaughter, but found that the ghouls were 3
far subtler in their plans. They glibbered certain simple orders to the night- 3
gaunts which held the captives, trusting the rest to instinct; and soon the hapless 3
creatures were borne silently away into the Great Abyss, to be distributed 3
impartially amongst the Dholes, Gugs, ghasts and other dwellers in darkness 3
whose modes of nourishment are not painless to their chosen victims. 3
Meanwhile the three bound ghouls had been released and consoled by their 3
conquering kinsfolk, whilst various parties searched the neighborhood for 3
possible remaining moonbeasts, and boarded the evil-smelling black galley at the 3
wharf to make sure that nothing had escaped the general defeat. Surely enough, 3
the capture had been thorough, for not a sign of further life could the victors 3
detect. Carter, anxious to preserve a means of access to the rest of dreamland, 3
urged them not to sink the anchored galley; and this request was freely granted 3
out of gratitude for his act in reporting the plight of the captured trio. On the 3
ship were found some very curious objects and decorations, some of which 3
Carter cast at once into the sea. 3
3
Ghouls and night-gaunts now formed themselves in separate groups, the former 3
questioning their rescued fellow anent past happenings. It appeared that the 3
three had followed Carter's directions and proceeded from the enchanted wood 3
to Dylath-Leen by way of Nir and the Skin, stealing human clothes at a lonely 3
farmhouse and loping as closely as possible in the fashion of a man's walk. In 3
Dylath-Leen's taverns their grotesque ways and faces had aroused much 3
comment; but they had persisted in asking the way to Sarkomand until at last an 3
old traveller was able to tell them. Then they knew that only a ship for Lelag- 3
Leng would serve their purpose, and prepared to wait patiently for such a vessel. 3
3
But evil spies had doubtless reported much; for shortly a black galley put into 3
port, and the wide-mouthed ruby merchants invited the ghouls to drink with 3
them in a tavern. Wine was produced from one of those sinister bottles 3
grotesquely carven from a single ruby, and after that the ghouls found 3
themselves prisoners on the black galley as Carter had found himself. This time, 3
however, the unseen rowers steered not for the moon but for antique 3
Sarkomand; bent evidently on taking their captives before the High-Priest Not 3
To Be Described. They had touched at the jagged rock in the northern sea which 3
Inquanok's mariners shun, and the ghouls had there seen for the first time the 3
red masters of the ship; being sickened despite their own callousness by such 3
extremes of malign shapelessness and fearsome odour. There, too, were 3
witnessed the nameless pastimes of the toadlike resident garrison-such pastimes 3
as give rise to the night-howlings which men fear. After that had come the 3
3
3
3
495 3
3
3
3
landing at ruined Sarkomand and the beginning of the tortures, whose 3
continuance the present rescue had prevented. 3
3
Future plans were next discussed, the three rescued ghouls suggesting a raid on 3
the jagged rock and the extermination of the toadlike garrison there. To this, 3
however, the night-gaunts objected; since the prospect of flying over water did 3
not please them. Most of the ghouls favoured the design, but were at a loss how 3
to follow it without the help of the winged night-gaunts. Thereupon Carter, 3
seeing that they could not navigate the anchored galley, offered to teach them the 3
use of the great banks of oars; to which proposal they eagerly assented. Grey day 3
had now come, and under that leaden northern sky a picked detachment of 3
ghouls filed into the noisome ship and took their seats on the rowers' benches. 3
Carter found them fairly apt at learning, and before night had risked several 3
experimental trips around the harbour. Not till three days later, however, did he 3
deem it safe to attempt the voyage of conquest. Then, the rowers trained and the 3
night-gaunts safely stowed in the forecastle, the party set sail at last; Pickman 3
and the other chiefs gathering on deck and discussing models of approach and 3
procedure. 3
3
On the very first night the bowlings from the rock were heard. Such was their 3
timbre that all the galley's crew shook visibly; but most of all trembled the three 3
rescued ghouls who knew precisely what those bowlings meant. It was not 3
thought best to attempt an attack by night, so the ship lay to under the 3
phosphorescent clouds to wait for the dawn of a greyish day. when the light was 3
ample and the bowlings still the rowers resumed their strokes, and the galley 3
drew closer and closer to that jagged rock whose granite pinnacles clawed 3
fantastically at the dull sky. The sides of the rock were very steep; but on ledges 3
here and there could be seen the bulging walls of queer windowless dwellings, 3
and the low railings guarding travelled highroads. No ship of men had ever 3
come so near the place, or at least, had never come so near and departed again; 3
but Carter and the ghouls were void of fear and kept inflexibly on, rounding the 3
eastern face of the rock and seeking the wharves which the rescued trio 3
described as being on the southern side within a harbour formed of steep 3
headlands. 3
3
The headlands were prolongations of the island proper, and came so closely 3
together that only one ship at a time might pass between them. There seemed to 3
be no watchers on the outside, so the galley was steered boldly through the 3
flume-like strait and into the stagnant putrid harbour beyond. Here, however, all 3
was bustle and activity; with several ships lying at anchor along a forbidding 3
stone quay, and scores of almost-human slaves and moonbeasts by the 3
waterfront handling crates and boxes or driving nameless and fabulous horrors 3
hitched to lumbering lorries. There was a small stone town hewn out of the 3
3
3
3
496 3
3
3
3
vertical cliff above the wharves, with the start of a winding road that spiralled 3
out of sight toward higher ledges of the rock. Of what lay inside that prodigious 3
peak of granite none might say, but the things one saw on the outside were far 3
from encouraging. 3
3
At sight of the incoming galley the crowds on the wharves displayed much 3
eagerness; those with eyes staring intently, and those without eyes wriggling 3
their pink tentacles expectantly. They did not, of course, realize that the black 3
ship had changed hands; for ghouls look much like the horned and hooved 3
almost-humans, and the night-gaunts were all out of sight below. By this time 3
the leaders had fully formed a plan; which was to loose the night-gaunts as soon 3
as the wharf was touched, and then to sail directly away, leaving matters wholly 3
to the instincts of those almost-mindless creatures. Marooned on the rock, the 3
horned flyers would first of all seize whatever living things they found there, 3
and afterward, quite helpless to think except in terms of the homing instinct, 3
would forget their fears of water and fly swiftly back to the abyss; bearing their 3
noisome prey to appropriate destinations in the dark, from which not much 3
would emerge alive. 3
3
The ghoul that was Pickman now went below and gave the night-gaunts their 3
simple instructions, while the ship drew very near to the ominous and 3
malodorous wharves. Presently a fresh stir rose along the waterfront, and Carter 3
saw that the motions of the galley had begun to excite suspicion. Evidently the 3
steersman was not making for the right dock, and probably the watchers had 3
noticed the difference between the hideous ghouls and the almost-human slaves 3
whose places they were taking. Some silent alarm must have been given, for 3
almost at once a horde of the mephitic moonbeasts began to pour from the little 3
black doorways of the windowless houses and down the winding road at the 3
right. A rain of curious javelins struck the galley as the prow hit the wharf felling 3
two ghouls and slightly wounding another; but at this point all the hatches were 3
thrown open to emit a black cloud of whirring night-gaunts which swarmed over 3
the town like a flock of horned and cyclopean bats. 3
3
The jellyish moonbeasts had procured a great pole and were trying to push off 3
the invading ship, but when the night-gaunts struck them they thought of such 3
things no more. It was a very terrible spectacle to see those faceless and rubbery 3
ticklers at their pastime, and tremendously impressive to watch the dense cloud 3
of them spreading through the town and up the winding roadway to the reaches 3
above. Sometimes a group of the black flutterers would drop a toadlike prisoner 3
from aloft by mistake, and the manner in which the victim would burst was 3
highly offensive to the sight and smell. When the last of the night-gaunts had left 3
the galley the ghoulish leaders glibbered an order of withdrawal, and the rowers 3
3
3
3
497 3
3
3
3
pulled quietly out of the harbour between the grey headlands while still the 3
town was a chaos of battle and conquest. 3
3
The Pickman ghoul allowed several hours for the night-gaunts to make up their 3
rudimentary minds and overcome their fear of flying over the sea, and kept the 3
galley standing about a mile off the jagged rock while he waited, and dressed the 3
wounds of the injured men. Night fell, and the grey twilight gave place to the 3
sickly phosphorescence of low clouds, and all the while the leaders watched the 3
high peaks of that accursed rock for signs of the night-gaunts' flight. Toward 3
morning a black speck was seen hovering timidly over the top-most pinnacle, 3
and shortly afterward the speck had become a swarm. Just before daybreak the 3
swarm seemed to scatter, and within a quarter of an hour it had vanished wholly 3
in the distance toward the northeast. Once or twice something seemed to fall 3
from the thing swarm into the sea; but Carter did not worry, since he knew from 3
observation that the toadlike moonbeasts cannot swim. At length, when the 3
ghouls were satisfied that all the night-gaunts had left for Sarkomand and the 3
Great Abyss with their doomed burdens, the galley put back into the harbour 3
betwixt the grey headlands; and all the hideous company landed and roamed 3
curiously over the denuded rock with its towers and eyries and fortresses 3
chiselled from the solid stone. 3
3
Frightful were the secrets uncovered in those evil and windowless crypts; for the 3
remnants of unfinished pastimes were many, and in various stages of departure 3
from their primal state. Carter put out of the way certain things which were after 3
a fashion alive, and fled precipitately from a few other things about which he 3
could not be very positive. The stench-filled houses were furnished mostly with 3
grotesque stools and benches carven from moon-trees, and were painted inside 3
with nameless and frantic designs. Countless weapons, implements, and 3
ornaments lay about, including some large idols of solid ruby depicting singular 3
beings not found on the earth. These latter did not, despite their material, invite 3
either appropriation or long inspection; and Carter took the trouble to hammer 3
five of them into very small pieces. The scattered spears and javelins he collected, 3
and with Pickman's approval distributed among the ghouls. Such devices were 3
new to the doglike lopers, but their relative simplicity made them easy to master 3
after a few concise hints. 3
3
The upper parts of the rock held more temples than private homes, and in 3
numerous hewn chambers were found terrible carven altars and doubtfully 3
stained fonts and shrines for the worship of things more monstrous than the wild 3
gods atop Kadath. From the rear of one great temple stretched a low black 3
passage which Carter followed far into the rock with a torch till he came to a 3
lightless domed hall of vast proportions, whose vaultings were covered with 3
demoniac carvings and in whose centre yawned a foul and bottomless well like 3
3
3
3
498 3
3
3
3
that in the hideous monastery of Leng where broods alone the High-Priest Not 3
To Be Described. On the distant shadowy side, beyond the noisome well, he 3
thought he discerned a small door of strangely wrought bronze; but for some 3
reason he felt an unaccountable dread of opening it or even approaching it, and 3
hastened back through the cavern to his unlovely allies as they shambled about 3
with an ease and abandon he could scarcely feel. The ghouls had observed the 3
unfinished pastimes of the moonbeasts, and had profited in their fashion. They 3
had also found a hogshead of potent moon-wine, and were rolling it down to the 3
wharves for removal and later use in diplomatic dealings, though the rescued 3
trio, remembering its effect on them in Dylath-Leen, had warned their company 3
to taste none of it. Of rubies from lunar mines there was a great store, both rough 3
and polished, in one of the vaults near the water; but when the ghouls found 3
they were not good to eat they lost all interest in them. Carter did not try to carry 3
any away, since he knew too much about those which had mined them. 3
3
Suddenly there came an excited meeping from the sentries on the wharves, and 3
all the loathsome foragers turned from their tasks to stare seaward and cluster 3
round the waterfront. Betwixt the grey headlands a fresh black galley was 3
rapidly advancing, and it would be but a moment before the almost-humans on 3
deck would perceive the invasion of the town and give the alarm to the 3
monstrous things below. Fortunately the ghouls still bore the spears and javelins 3
which Carter had distributed amongst them; and at his command, sustained by 3
the being that was Pickman, they now formed a line of battle and prepared to 3
prevent the landing of the ship. Presently a burst of excitement on the galley told 3
of the crew's discovery of the changed state of things, and the instant stoppage of 3
the vessel proved that the superior numbers of the ghouls had been noted and 3
taken into account. After a moment of hesitation the new comers silently turned 3
and passed out between the headlands again, but not for an instant did the 3
ghouls imagine that the conflict was averted. Either the dark ship would seek 3
reinforcements or the crew would try to land elsewhere on the island; hence a 3
party of scouts was at once sent up toward the pinnacle to see what the enemy's 3
course would be. 3
3
In a very few minutes the ghoul returned breathless to say that the moonbeasts 3
and almost-humans were landing on the outside of the more easterly of the 3
rugged grey headlands, and ascending by hidden paths and ledges which a goat 3
could scarcely tread in safety. Almost immediately afterward the galley was 3
sighted again through the flume-like strait, but only for a second. Then a few 3
moments later, a second messenger panted down from aloft to say that another 3
party was landing on the other headland; both being much more numerous than 3
the size of the galley would seem to allow for. The ship itself, moving slowly 3
with only one sparsely manned tier of oars, soon hove in sight betwixt the cliffs. 3
3
3
3
499 3
3
3
3
and lay to in the foetid harbour as if to watch the coming fray and stand by for 3
any possible use. 3
3
By this time Carter and Pickman had divided the ghouls into three parties, one to 3
meet each of the two invading columns and one to remain in the town. The first 3
two at once scrambled up the rocks in their respective directions, while the third 3
was subdivided into a land party and a sea party. The sea party, commanded by 3
Carter, boarded the anchored galley and rowed out to meet the under-manned 3
galley of the newcomers; whereat the latter retreated through the strait to the 3
open sea. Carter did not at once pursue it, for he knew he might be needed more 3
acutely near the town. 3
3
Meanwhile the frightful detachments of the moonbeasts and almost-humans had 3
lumbered up to the top of the headlands and were shockingly silhouetted on 3
either side against the grey twilight sky. The thin hellish flutes of the invaders 3
had now begun to whine, and the general effect of those hybrid, half-amorphous 3
processions was as nauseating as the actual odour given off by the toadlike lunar 3
blasphemies. Then the two parties of the ghouls swarmed into sight and joined 3
the silhouetted panorama. Javelins began to fly from both sides, and the swelling 3
meeps of the ghouls and the bestial howls of the almost-humans gradually joined 3
the hellish whine of the flutes to form a frantick and indescribable chaos of 3
daemon cacophony. Now and then bodies fell from the narrow ridges of the 3
headlands into the sea outside or the harbour inside, in the latter case being 3
sucked quickly under by certain submarine lurkers whose presence was 3
indicated only by prodigious bubbles. 3
3
For half an hour this dual battle raged in the sky, till upon the west cliff the 3
invaders were completely annihilated. On the east cliff, however, where the 3
leader of the moonbeast party appeared to be present, the ghouls had not fared 3
so well; and were slowly retreating to the slopes of the pinnacle proper. Pickman 3
had quickly ordered reinforcements for this front from the party in the town, and 3
these had helped greatly in the earlier stages of the combat. Then, when the 3
western battle was over, the victorious survivors hastened across to the aid of 3
their hard-pressed fellows; turning the tide and forcing the invaders back again 3
along the narrow ridge of the headland. The almost-humans were by this time all 3
slain, but the last of the toadlike horrors fought desperately with the great spears 3
clutched in their powerful and disgusting paws. The time for javelins was now 3
nearly past, and the fight became a hand-to-hand contest of what few spearmen 3
could meet upon that narrow ridge. 3
3
As fury and recklessness increased, the number falling into the sea became very 3
great. Those striking the harbour met nameless extinction from the unseen 3
bubblers, but of those striking the open sea some were able to swim to the foot of 3
3
3
3
500 3
3
3
3
the cliffs and land on tidal rocks, while the hovering galley of the enemy rescued 3
several moonbeasts. The cliffs were unscalable except where the monsters had 3
debarked, so that none of the ghouls on the rocks could rejoin their battle-line. 3
Some were killed by javelins from the hostile galley or from the moonbeasts 3
above, but a few survived to be rescued. When the security of the land parties 3
seemed assured. Carter's galley sallied forth between the headlands and drove 3
the hostile ship far out to sea; pausing to rescue such ghouls as were on the rocks 3
or still swimming in the ocean. Several moonbeasts washed on rocks or reefs 3
were speedily put out of the way. 3
3
Finally, the moonbeast galley being safely in the distance and the invading land 3
army concentrated in one place. Carter landed a considerable force on the eastern 3
headland in the enemy's rear; after which the fight was short-lived indeed. 3
Attacked from both sides, the noisome flounderers were rapidly cut to pieces or 3
pushed into the sea, till by evening the ghoulish chiefs agreed that the island was 3
again clear of them. The hostile galley, meanwhile, had disappeared; and it was 3
decided that the evil jagged rock had better be evacuated before any 3
overwhelming horde of lunar horrors might be assembled and brought against 3
the victors. 3
3
So by night Pickman and Carter assembled all the ghouls and counted them with 3
care, finding that over a fourth had been lost in the day's battles. The wounded 3
were placed on bunks in the galley, for Pickman always discouraged the old 3
ghoulish custom of killing and eating one's own wounded, and the able-bodied 3
troops were assigned to the oars or to such other places as they might most 3
usefully fill. Under the low phosphorescent clouds of night the galley sailed, and 3
Carter was not sorry to be departing from the island of unwholesome secrets, 3
whose lightless domed hall with its bottomless well and repellent bronze door 3
lingered restlessly in his fancy. Dawn found the ship in sight of Sarkomand's 3
ruined quays of basalt, where a few night-gaunt sentries still waited, squatting 3
like black horned gargoyles on the broken columns and crumbling sphinxes of 3
that fearful city which lived and died before the years of man. 3
3
The ghouls made camp amongst the fallen stones of Sarkomand, despatching a 3
messenger for enough night-gaunts to serve them as steeds. Pickman and the 3
other chiefs were effusive in their gratitude for the aid Carter had lent them. 3
Carter now began to feel that his plans were indeed maturing well, and that he 3
would be able to command the help of these fearsome allies not only in quitting 3
this part of dreamland, but in pursuing his ultimate quest for the gods atop 3
unknown Kadath, and the marvellous sunset city they so strangely withheld 3
from his slumbers. Accordingly he spoke of these things to the ghoulish leaders; 3
telling what he knew of the cold waste wherein Kadath stands and of the 3
monstrous Shantaks and the mountains carven into double-headed images 3
3
3
3
501 3
3
3
3
which guard it. He spoke of the fear of Shantaks for night-gaunts, and of how the 3
vast hippocephahc birds fly screaming from the black burrows high up on the 3
gaunt grey peaks that divide Inquanok from hateful Leng. He spoke, too, of the 3
things he had learned concerning night-gaunts from the frescoes in the 3
windowless monastery of the High-Priest Not To Be Described; how even the 3
Great Ones fear them, and how their ruler is not the crawling chaos Nyarlathotep 3
at all, but hoary and immemorial Nodens, Lord of the Great Abyss. 3
3
All these things Carter glibbered to the assembled ghouls, and presently outlined 3
that request which he had in mind and which he did not think extravagant 3
considering the services he had so lately rendered the rubbery doglike lopers. He 3
wished very much, he said, for the services of enough night-gaunts to bear him 3
safely through the aft past the realm of Shantaks and carven mountains, and up 3
into the old waste beyond the returning tracks of any other mortal. He desired to 3
fly to the onyx castle atop unknown Kadath in the cold waste to plead with the 3
Great Ones for the sunset city they denied him, and felt sure that the night- 3
gaunts could take him thither without trouble; high above the perils of the plain, 3
and over the hideous double heads of those carven sentinel mountains that squat 3
eternally in the grey dusk. For the horned and faceless creatures there could be 3
no danger from aught of earth since the Great Ones themselves dread them. And 3
even were unexpected things to come from the Other Gods, who are prone to 3
oversee the affairs of earth's milder gods, the night-gaunts need not fear; for the 3
outer hells are indifferent matters to such silent and slippery flyers as own not 3
Nyarlathotep for their master, but bow only to potent and archaic Nodens. 3
3
A flock of ten or fifteen night-gaunts. Carter glibbered, would surely be enough 3
to keep any combination of Shantaks at a distance, though perhaps it might be 3
well to have some ghouls in the party to manage the creatures, their ways being 3
better known to their ghoulish allies than to men. The party could land him at 3
some convenient point within whatever walls that fabulous onyx citadel might 3
have, waiting in the shadows for his return or his signal whilst he ventured 3
inside the castle to give prayer to the gods of earth. If any ghouls chose to escort 3
him into the throne-room of the Great Ones, he would be thankful, for their 3
presence would add weight and importance to his plea. He would not, however, 3
insist upon this but merely wished transportation to and from the castle atop 3
unknown Kadath; the final journey being either to the marvellous sunset city 3
itself, in case of gods proved favourable, or back to the earthward Gate of Deeper 3
Slumber in the Enchanted Wood in case his prayers were fruitless. 3
3
Whilst Carter was speaking all the ghouls listened with great attention, and as 3
the moments advanced the sky became black with clouds of those night-gaunts 3
for which messengers had been sent. The winged steeds settled in a semicircle 3
around the ghoulish army, waiting respectfully as the doglike chieftains 3
3
3
3
502 3
3
3
3
considered the wish of the earthly traveller. The ghoul that was Pickman 3
glibbered gravely with his fellows and in the end Carter was offered far more 3
than he had at most expected. As he had aided the ghouls in their conquest of the 3
moonbeasts, so would they aid him in his daring voyage to realms whence none 3
had ever returned; lending him not merely a few of their allied night-gaunts, but 3
their entire army as then encamped, veteran fighting ghouls and newly 3
assembled night-gaunts alike, save only a small garrison for the captured black 3
galley and such spoils as had come from the jagged rock in the sea. They would 3
set out through the aft whenever he might wish, and once arrived on Kadath a 3
suitable train of ghouls would attend him in state as he placed his petition before 3
earth's gods in their onyx castle. 3
3
Moved by a gratitude and satisfaction beyond words. Carter made plans with 3
the ghoulish leaders for his audacious voyage. The army would fly high, they 3
decided, over hideous Leng with its nameless monastery and wicked stone 3
villages; stopping only at the vast grey peaks to confer with the Shantak- 3
frightening night-gaunts whose burrows honeycombed their summits. They 3
would then, according to what advice they might receive from those denizens, 3
choose their final course; approaching unknown Kadath either through the 3
desert of carven mountains north of Inquanok, or through the more northerly 3
reaches of repulsive Leng itself. Doglike and soulless as they are, the ghouls and 3
night-gaunts had no dread of what those untrodden deserts might reveal; nor 3
did they feel any deterring awe at the thought of Kadath towering lone with its 3
onyx castle of mystery. 3
3
About midday the ghouls and night-gaunts prepared for flight, each ghoul 3
selecting a suitable pair of horned steeds to bear him. Carter was placed well up 3
toward the head of the column beside Pickman, and in front of the whole a 3
double line of riderless night-gaunts was provided as a vanguard. At a brisk 3
meep from Pickman the whole shocking army rose in a nightmare cloud above 3
the broken columns and crumbling sphinxes of primordial Sarkomand; higher 3
and higher, till even the great basalt cliff behind the town was cleared, and the 3
cold, sterile table-land of Leng's outskirts laid open to sight. Still higher flew the 3
black host, till even this table-land grew small beneath them; and as they worked 3
northward over the wind-swept plateau of horror Carter saw once again with a 3
shudder the circle of crude monoliths and the squat windowless building which 3
he knew held that frightful silken-masked blasphemy from whose clutches he 3
had so narrowly escaped. This time no descent was made as the army swept 3
batlike over the sterile landscape, passing the feeble fires of the unwholesome 3
stone villages at a great altitude, and pausing not at all to mark the morbid 3
twistings of the hooved, horned almost-humans that dance and pipe eternally 3
therein. Once they saw a Shantak-bird flying low over the plain, but when it saw 3
them it screamed noxiously and flapped off to the north in grotesque panic. 3
3
3
3
503 3
3
3
3
At dusk they reached the jagged grey peaks that form the barrier of Inquanok, 3
and hovered about these strange caves near the summits which Carter recalled as 3
so frightful to the Shantaks. At the insistent meeping of the ghoulish leaders 3
there issued forth from each lofty burrow a stream of horned black flyers with 3
which the ghouls and night-gaunts of the party conferred at length by means of 3
ugly gestures. It soon became clear that the best course would be that over the 3
cold waste north of Inquanok, for Leng's northward reaches are full of unseen 3
pitfalls that even the night-gaunts dislike; abysmal influences centering in certain 3
white hemispherical buildings on curious knolls, which common folklore 3
associates unpleasantly with the Other Gods and their crawling chaos 3
Nyarlathotep. 3
3
Of Kadath the flutterers of the peaks knew almost nothing, save that there must 3
be some mighty marvel toward the north, over which the Shantaks and the 3
carven mountains stand guard. They hinted at rumoured abnormalities of 3
proportion in those trackless leagues beyond, and recalled vague whispers of a 3
realm where night broods eternally; but of definite data they had nothing to give. 3
So Carter and his party thanked them kindly; and, crossing the topmost granite 3
pinnacles to the skies of Inquanok, dropped below the level of the 3
phosphorescent night clouds and beheld in the distance those terrible squatting 3
gargoyles that were mountains till some titan hand carved fright into their virgin 3
rock. 3
3
There they squatted in a hellish half-circle, their legs on the desert sand and their 3
mitres piercing the luminous clouds; sinister, wolflike, and double-headed, with 3
faces of fury and right hands raised, dully and malignly watching the rim of 3
man's world and guarding with horror the reaches of a cold northern world that 3
is not man's. From their hideous laps rose evil Shantaks of elephantine bulk, but 3
these all fled with insane titters as the vanguard of night-gaunts was sighted in 3
the misty sky. Northward above those gargoyle mountains the army flew, and 3
over leagues of dim desert where never a landmark rose. Less and less luminous 3
grew the clouds, till at length Carter could see only blackness around him; but 3
never did the winged steeds falter, bred as they were in earth's blackest crypts, 3
and seeing not with any eyes, but with the whole dank surface of their slippery 3
forms. On and on they flew, past winds of dubious scent and sounds of dubious 3
import; ever in thickest darkness, and covering such prodigious spaces that 3
Carter wondered whether or not they could still be within earth's dreamland. 3
3
Then suddenly the clouds thinned and the stars shone spectrally above. All 3
below was still black, but those pallid beacons in the sky seemed alive with a 3
meaning and directiveness they had never possessed elsewhere. It was not that 3
the figures of the constellations were different, but that the same familiar shapes 3
now revealed a significance they had formerly failed to make plain. Everything 3
3
3
3
504 3
3
3
3
focussed toward the north; every curve and asterism of the ghttering sky became 3
part of a vast design whose function was to hurry first the eye and then the 3
whole observer onward to some secret and terrible goal of convergence beyond 3
the frozen waste that stretched endlessly ahead. Carter looked toward the east 3
where the great ridge of barrier peaks had towered along all the length of 3
Inquanok and saw against the stars a jagged silhouette which told of its 3
continued presence. It was more broken now, with yawning clefts and 3
fantastically erratic pinnacles; and Carter studied closely the suggestive turnings 3
and inclinations of that grotesque outline, which seemed to share with the stars 3
some subtle northward urge. 3
3
They were flying past at a tremendous speed, so that the watcher had to strain 3
hard to catch details; when all at once he beheld just above the line of the 3
topmost peaks a dark and moving object against the stars, whose course exactly 3
paralleled that of his own bizarre party. The ghouls had likewise glimpsed it, for 3
he heard their low glibbering all about him, and for a moment he fancied the 3
object was a gigantic Shantak, of a size vastly greater than that of the average 3
specimen. Soon, however, he saw that this theory would not hold; for the shape 3
of the thing above the mountains was not that of any hippocephalic bird. Its 3
outline against the stars, necessarily vague as it was, resembled rather some huge 3
mitred head, or pair of heads infinitely magnified; and its rapid bobbing flight 3
through the sky seemed most peculiarly a wingless one. Carter could not tell 3
which side of the mountains it was on, but soon perceived that it had parts below 3
the parts he had first seen, since it blotted out all the stars in places where the 3
ridge was deeply cleft. 3
3
Then came a wide gap in the range, where the hideous reaches of transmontane 3
Leng were joined to the cold waste on this side by a low pass trough which the 3
stars shone wanly. Carter watched this gap with intense care, knowing that he 3
might see outlined against the sky beyond it the lower parts of the vast thing that 3
flew undulantly above the pinnacles. The object had now floated ahead a trifle, 3
and every eye of the party was fixed on the rift where it would presently appear 3
in full-length silhouette. Gradually the huge thing above the peaks neared the 3
gap, slightly slackening its speed as if conscious of having outdistanced the 3
ghoulish army. For another minute suspense was keen, and then the brief instant 3
of full silhouette and revelation came; bringing to the lips of the ghouls an awed 3
and half-choked meep of cosmic fear, and to the soul of the traveller a chill that 3
never wholly left it. For the mammoth bobbing shape that overtopped the ridge 3
was only a head - a mitred double head - and below it in terrible vastness loped 3
the frightful swollen body that bore it; the mountain-high monstrosity that 3
walked in stealth and silence; the hyaena-like distortion of a giant anthropoid 3
shape that trotted blackly against the sky, its repulsive pair of cone-capped heads 3
reaching half way to the zenith. 3
3
3
3
505 3
3
3
3
Carter did not lose consciousness or even scream aloud, for he was an old 3
dreamer; but he looked behind him in horror and shuddered when he saw that 3
there were other monstrous heads silhouetted above the level of the peaks, 3
bobbing along stealthily after the first one. And straight in the rear were three of 3
the mighty mountain shapes seen full against the southern stars, tiptoeing 3
wolflike and lumberingly, their tall mitres nodding thousands of feet in the aft. 3
The carven mountains, then, had not stayed squatting in that rigid semicircle 3
north of Inquanok, with right hands uplifted. They had duties to perform, and 3
were not remiss. But it was horrible that they never spoke, and never even made 3
a sound in walking. 3
3
Meanwhile the ghoul that was Pickman had glibbered an order to the night- 3
gaunts, and the whole army soared higher into the air. Up toward the stars the 3
grotesque column shot, till nothing stood out any longer against the sky; neither 3
the grey granite ridge that was still nor the carven mitred mountains that 3
walked. All was blackness beneath as the fluttering legion surged northward 3
amidst rushing winds and invisible laughter in the aether, and never a Shantak 3
or less mentionable entity rose from the haunted wastes to pursue them. The 3
farther they went, the faster they flew, till soon their dizzying speed seemed to 3
pass that of a rifle ball and approach that of a planet in its orbit. Carter wondered 3
how with such speed the earth could still stretch beneath them, but knew that in 3
the land of dream dimensions have strange properties. That they were in a realm 3
of eternal night he felt certain, and he fancied that the constellations overhead 3
had subtly emphasized their northward focus; gathering themselves up as it 3
were to cast the flying army into the void of the boreal pole, as the folds of a bag 3
are gathered up to cast out the last bits of substance therein. 3
3
Then he noticed with terror that the wings of the night-gaunts were not flapping 3
any more. The horned and faceless steeds had folded their membranous 3
appendages, and were resting quite passive in the chaos of wind that whirled 3
and chuckled as it bore them on. A force not of earth had seized on the army, and 3
ghouls and night-gaunts alike were powerless before a current which pulled 3
madly and relentlessly into the north whence no mortal had ever returned. At 3
length a lone pallid light was seen on the skyline ahead, thereafter rising steadily 3
as they approached, and having beneath it a black mass that blotted out the stars. 3
Carter saw that it must be some beacon on a mountain, for only a mountain 3
could rise so vast as seen from so prodigious a height in the air. 3
3
Higher and higher rose the light and the blackness beneath it, till all the northern 3
sky was obscured by the rugged conical mass. Lofty as the army was, that pale 3
and sinister beacon rose above it, towering monstrous over all peaks and 3
concernments of earth, and tasting the atomless aether where the cryptical moon 3
and the mad planets reel. No mountain known of man was that which loomed 3
3
3
3
506 3
3
3
3
before them. The high clouds far below were but a fringe for its foothills. The 3
groping dizziness of topmost air was but a girdle for its loins. Scornful and 3
spectral climbed that bridge betwixt earth and heaven, black in eternal night, and 3
crowned with a pshent of unknown stars whose awful and significant outline 3
grew every moment clearer. Ghouls meeped in wonder as they saw it, and Carter 3
shivered in fear lest all the hurtling army be dashed to pieces on the unyielding 3
onyx of that Cyclopean cliff. 3
3
Higher and higher rose the light, till it mingled with the loftiest orbs of the zenith 3
and winked down at the flyers with lurid mockery. All the north beneath it was 3
blackness now; dread, stony blackness from infinite depths to infinite heights, 3
with only that pale winking beacon perched unreachably at the top of all vision. 3
Carter studied the light more closely, and saw at last what lines its inky 3
background made against the stars. There were towers on that titan 3
mountaintop; horrible domed towers in noxious and incalculable tiers and 3
clusters beyond any dreamable workmanship of man; battlements and terraces 3
of wonder and menace, all limned tiny and black and distant against the starry 3
pshent that glowed malevolently at the uppermost rim of sight. Capping that 3
most measureless of mountains was a castle beyond all mortal thought, and in it 3
glowed the daemon-light. Then Randolph Carter knew that his quest was done, 3
and that he saw above him the goal of all forbidden steps and audacious visions; 3
the fabulous, the incredible home of the Great Ones atop unknown Kadath. 3
3
Even as he realised this thing. Carter noticed a change in the course of the 3
helplessly wind-sucked party. They were rising abruptly now, and it was plain 3
that the focus of their flight was the onyx castle where the pale light shone. So 3
close was the great black mountain that its sides sped by them dizzily as they 3
shot upward, and in the darkness they could discern nothing upon it. Vaster and 3
vaster loomed the tenebrous towers of the nighted castle above, and Carter could 3
see that it was well-nigh blasphemous in its immensity. Well might its stones 3
have been quarried by nameless workmen in that horrible gulf rent out of the 3
rock in the hill pass north of Inquanok, for such was its size that a man on its 3
threshold stood even as air out on the steps of earth's loftiest fortress. The pshent 3
of unknown stars above the myriad domed turrets glowed with a sallow, sickly 3
flare, so that a kind of twilight hung about the murky walls of slippery onyx. The 3
pallid beacon was now seen to be a single shining window high up in one of the 3
loftiest towers, and as the helpless army neared the top of the mountain Carter 3
thought he detected unpleasant shadows flitting across the feebly luminous 3
expanse. It was a strangely arched window, of a design wholly alien to earth. 3
3
The solid rock now gave place to the giant foundations of the monstrous castle, 3
and it seemed that the speed of the party was somewhat abated. Vast walls shot 3
up, and there was a glimpse of a great gate through which the voyagers were 3
3
3
3
507 3
3
3
3
swept. All was night in the titan courtyard, and then came the deeper blackness 3
of inmost things as a huge arched portal engulfed the column. Vortices of cold 3
wind surged dankly through sightless labyrinths of onyx, and Carter could never 3
tell what Cyclopean stairs and corridors lay silent along the route of his endless 3
aerial twisting. Always upward led the terrible plunge in darkness, and never a 3
sound, touch or glimpse broke the dense pall of mystery. Large as the army of 3
ghouls and night-gaunts was, it was lost in the prodigious voids of that more 3
than earthly castle. And when at last there suddenly dawned around him the 3
lurid light of that single tower room whose lofty window had served as a beacon, 3
it took Carter long to discern the far walls and high, distant ceiling, and to realize 3
that he was indeed not again in the boundless air outside. 3
3
Randolph Carter had hoped to come into the throne-room of the Great Ones with 3
poise and dignity, flanked and followed by impressive lines of ghouls in 3
ceremonial order, and offering his prayer as a free and potent master among 3
dreamers. He had known that the Great Ones themselves are not beyond a 3
mortal's power to cope with, and had trusted to luck that the Other Gods and 3
their crawling chaos Nyarlathotep would not happen to come to their aid at the 3
crucial moment, as they had so often done before when men sought out earth's 3
gods in their home or on their mountains. And with his hideous escort he had 3
half hoped to defy even the Other Gods if need were, knowing as he did that 3
ghouls have no masters, and that night-gaunts own not Nyarlathotep but only 3
archaic Nodens for their lord. But now he saw that supernal Kadath in its cold 3
waste is indeed girt with dark wonders and nameless sentinels, and that the 3
Other Gods are of a surety vigilant in guarding the mild, feeble gods of earth. 3
Void as they are of lordship over ghouls and night-gaunts, the mindless, 3
shapeless blasphemies of outer space can yet control them when they must; so 3
that it was not in state as a free and potent master of dreamers that Randolph 3
Carter came into the Great Ones' throne-room with his ghouls. Swept and 3
herded by nightmare tempests from the stars, and dogged by unseen horrors of 3
the northern waste, all that army floated captive and helpless in the lurid light, 3
dropping numbly to the onyx floor when by some voiceless order the winds of 3
fright dissolved. 3
3
Before no golden dais had Randolph Carter come, nor was there any august 3
circle of crowned and haloed beings with narrow eyes, long-lobed ears, thin 3
nose, and pointed chin whose kinship to the carven face on Ngranek might 3
stamp them as those to whom a dreamer might pray. Save for the one tower 3
room the onyx castle atop Kadath was dark, and the masters were not there. 3
Carter had come to unknown Kadath in the cold waste, but he had not found the 3
gods. Yet still the lurid light glowed in that one tower room whose size was so 3
little less than that of all outdoors, and whose distant walls and roof were so 3
nearly lost to sight in thin, curling mists. Earth's gods were not there, it was true. 3
3
3
3
508 3
3
3
3
but of subtler and less visible presences there could be no lack. Where the mild 3
gods are absent, the Other Gods are not unrepresented; and certainly, the onyx 3
castle of castles was far from tenantless. In what outrageous form or forms terror 3
would next reveal itself Carter could by no means imagine. He felt that his visit 3
had been expected, and wondered how close a watch had all along been kept 3
upon him by the crawling chaos Nyarlathotep. It is Nyarlathotep, horror of 3
infinite shapes and dread soul and messenger of the Other Gods, that the 3
fungous moonbeasts serve; and Carter thought of the black galley that had 3
vanished when the tide of battle turned against the toadlike abnormalities on the 3
jagged rock in the sea. 3
3
Reflecting upon these things, he was staggering to his feet in the midst of his 3
nightmare company when there rang without warning through that pale-litten 3
and limitless chamber the hideous blast of a daemon trumpet. Three times pealed 3
that frightful brazen scream, and when the echoes of the third blast had died 3
chucklingly away Randolph Carter saw that he was alone. Whither, why and 3
how the ghouls and night-gaunts had been snatched from sight was not for him 3
to divine. He knew only that he was suddenly alone, and that whatever unseen 3
powers lurked mockingly around him were no powers of earth's friendly 3
dreamland. Presently from the chamber's uttermost reaches a new sound came. 3
This, too, was a rhythmic trumpeting; but of a kind far removed from the three 3
raucous blasts which had dissolved his goodly cohorts. In this low fanfare 3
echoed all the wonder and melody of ethereal dream; exotic vistas of 3
unimagined loveliness floating from each strange chord and subtly alien 3
cadence. Odours of incense came to match the golden notes; and overhead a 3
great light dawned, its colours changing in cycles unknown to earth's spectrum, 3
and following the song of the trumpets in weird symphonic harmonies. Torches 3
flared in the distance, and the beat of drums throbbed nearer amidst waves of 3
tense expectancy. 3
3
Out of the thinning mists and the cloud of strange incenses filed twin columns of 3
giant black slaves with loin-cloths of iridescent silk. Upon their heads were 3
strapped vast helmet-like torches of glittering metal, from which the fragrance of 3
obscure balsams spread in fumous spirals. In their right hands were crystal 3
wands whose tips were carven into leering chimaeras, while their left hands 3
grasped long thin silver trumpets which they blew in turn. Armlets and anklets 3
of gold they had, and between each pair of anklets stretched a golden chain that 3
held its wearer to a sober gait. That they were true black men of earth's 3
dreamland was at once apparent, but it seemed less likely that their rites and 3
costumes were wholly things of our earth. Ten feet from Carter the columns 3
stopped, and as they did so each trumpet flew abruptly to its bearer's thick lips. 3
Wild and ecstatic was the blast that followed, and wilder still the cry that 3
chorused just after from dark throats somehow made shrill by strange artifice. 3
3
3
3
509 3
3
3
3
Then down the wide lane betwixt the two columns a lone figure strode; a tall, 3
slim figure with the young face of an antique Pharaoh, gay with prismatic robes 3
and crowned with a golden pshent that glowed with inherent light. Close up to 3
Carter strode that regal figure; whose proud carriage and smart features had in 3
them the fascination of a dark god or fallen archangel, and around whose eyes 3
there lurked the languid sparkle of capricious humour. It spoke, and in its 3
mellow tones there rippled the wild music of Lethean streams. 3
3
"Randolph Carter," said the voice, "you have come to see the Great Ones whom 3
it is unlawful for men to see. Watchers have spoken of this thing, and the Other 3
Gods have grunted as they rolled and tumbled mindlessly to the sound of thin 3
flutes in the black ultimate void where broods the daemon-sultan whose name 3
no lips dare speak aloud. 3
3
"When Barzai the Wise climbed Hatheg-Kia to see the Greater Ones dance and 3
howl above the clouds in the moonlight he never returned. The Other Gods were 3
there, and they did what was expected. Zenig of Aphorat sought to reach 3
unknown Kadath in the cold waste, and his skull is now set in a ring on the little 3
finger of one whom I need not name. 3
3
"But you, Randolph Carter, have braved all things of earth's dreamland, and 3
burn still with the flame of quest. You came not as one curious, but as one 3
seeking his due, nor have you failed ever in reverence toward the mild gods of 3
earth. Yet have these gods kept you from the marvellous sunset city of your 3
dreams, and wholly through their own small covetousness; for verily, they 3
craved the weird loveliness of that which your fancy had fashioned, and vowed 3
that henceforward no other spot should be their abode. 3
3
"They are gone from their castle on unknown Kadath to dwell in your 3
marvellous city. All through its palaces of veined marble they revel by day, and 3
when the sun sets they go out in the perfumed gardens and watch the golden 3
glory on temples and colonnades, arched bridges and silver-basined fountains, 3
and wide streets with blossom-laden urns and ivory statues in gleaming rows. 3
And when night comes they climb tall terraces in the dew, and sit on carved 3
benches of porphyry scanning the stars, or lean over pale balustrades to gaze at 3
the town's steep northward slopes, where one by one the little windows in old 3
peaked gables shine softly out with the calm yellow light of homely candles. 3
3
"The gods love your marvellous city, and walk no more in the ways of the gods. 3
They have forgotten the high places of earth, and the mountains that knew their 3
youth. The earth has no longer any gods that are gods, and only the Other Ones 3
from outer space hold sway on unremembered Kadath. Far away in a valley of 3
your own childhood, Randolph Carter, play the heedless Great Ones. You have 3
3
3
3
510 3
3
3
3
dreamed too well, O wise arch-dreamer, for you have drawn dream's gods away 3
from the world of all men's visions to that which is wholly yours; having builded 3
out of your boyhood's small fancies a city more lovely than all the phantoms that 3
have gone before. 3
3
"It is not well that earth's gods leave their thrones for the spider to spin on, and 3
their realm for the Others to sway in the dark manner of Others. Fain would the 3
powers from outside bring chaos and horror to you, Randolph Carter, who are 3
the cause of their upsetting, but that they know it is by you alone that the gods 3
may be sent back to their world. In that half-waking dreamland which is yours, 3
no power of uttermost night may pursue; and only you can send the selfish Great 3
Ones gently out of your marvellous sunset city, back through the northern 3
twilight to their wonted place atop unknown Kadath in the cold waste. 3
3
"So. Randolph Carter, in the name of the Other Gods I spare you and charge you 3
to seek that sunset city which is yours, and to send thence the drowsy truant 3
gods for whom the dream world waits. Not hard to find is that roseal fever of the 3
gods, that fanfare of supernal trumpets and clash of immortal cymbals, that 3
mystery whose place and meaning have haunted you through the halls of 3
waking and the gulfs of dreaming, and tormented you with hints of vanished 3
memory and the pain of lost things awesome and momentous. Not hard to find 3
is that symbol and relic of your days of wonder, for truly, it is but the stable and 3
eternal gem wherein all that wonder sparkles crystallised to light your evening 3
path. Behold! It is not over unknown seas but back over well-known years that 3
your quest must go; back to the bright strange things of infancy and the quick 3
sun-drenched glimpses of magic that old scenes brought to wide young eyes. 3
3
"For know you, that your gold and marble city of wonder is only the sum of 3
what you have seen and loved in youth. It is the glory of Boston's hillside roofs 3
and western windows aflame with sunset, of the flower-fragrant Common and 3
the great dome on the hill and the tangle of gables and chimneys in the violet 3
valley where the many-bridged Charles flows drowsily. These things you saw, 3
Randolph Carter, when your nurse first wheeled you out in the springtime, and 3
they will be the last things you will ever see with eyes of memory and of love. 3
And there is antique Salem with its brooding years, and spectral Marblehead 3
scaling its rocky precipices into past centuries! And the glory of Salem's towers 3
and spires seen afar from Marblehead's pastures across the harbour against the 3
setting sun. 3
3
"There is Providence quaint and lordly on its seven hills over the blue harbour, 3
with terraces of green leading up to steeples and citadels of living antiquity, and 3
Newport climbing wraithlike from its dreaming breakwater. Arkham is there, 3
with its moss-grown gambrel roofs and the rocky rolling meadows behind it; and 3
3
3
3
511 3
3
3
3
antediluvian Kingsport hoary with stacked chimneys and deserted quays and 3
overhanging gables, and the marvel of high cliffs and the milky-misted ocean 3
with tolling buoys beyond. 3
3
"Cool vales in Concord, cobbled lands in Portsmouth, twilight bends of rustic 3
New Hampshire roads where giant elms half hide white farmhouse walls and 3
creaking well-sweeps. Gloucester's salt wharves and Truro's windy willows. 3
Vistas of distant steepled towns and hills beyond hills along the North Shore, 3
hushed stony slopes and low ivied cottages in the lee of huge boulders in Rhode 3
Island's back country. Scent of the sea and fragrance of the fields; spell of the 3
dark woods and joy of the orchards and gardens at dawn. These, Randolph 3
Carter, are your city; for they are yourself. New England bore you, and into your 3
soul she poured a liquid loveliness which cannot die. This loveliness, moulded, 3
crystallised, and polished by years of memory and dreaming, is your terraced 3
wonder of elusive sunsets; and to find that marble parapet with curious urns and 3
carven rail, and descend at last these endless balustraded steps to the city of 3
broad squares and prismatic fountains, you need only to turn back to the 3
thoughts and visions of your wistful boyhood. 3
3
"Look! through that window shine the stars of eternal night. Even now they are 3
shining above the scenes you have known and cherished, drinking of their charm 3
that they may shine more lovely over the gardens of dream. There is Antares-he 3
is winking at this moment over the roofs of Tremont Street, and you could see 3
him from your window on Beacon Hill. Out beyond those stars yawn the gulfs 3
from whence my mindless masters have sent me. Some day you too may traverse 3
them, but if you are wise you will beware such folly; for of those mortals who 3
have been and returned, only one preserves a mind unshattered by the 3
pounding, clawing horrors of the void. Terrors and blasphemies gnaw at one 3
another for space, and there is more evil in the lesser ones than in the greater; 3
even as you know from the deeds of those who sought to deliver you into my 3
hands, whilst I myself harboured no wish to shatter you, and would indeed have 3
helped you hither long ago had I not been elsewhere busy,and certain that you 3
would yourself find the way. Shun then, the outer hells, and stick to the calm, 3
lovely things of your youth. Seek out your marvellous city and drive thence the 3
recreant Great Ones, sending them back gently to those scenes which are of their 3
own youth, and which wait uneasy for their return. 3
3
"Easier even then the way of dim memory is the way I will prepare for you. See! 3
There comes hither a monstrous Shantak, led by a slave who for your peace of 3
mind had best keep invisible. Mount and be ready - there! Yogash the Black will 3
help you on the scaly horror. Steer for that brightest star just south of the zenith - 3
it is Vega, and in two hours will be just above the terrace of your sunset city. 3
Steer for it only till you hear a far-off singing in the high aether. Higher than that 3
3
3
3
512 3
3
3
3
lurks madness, so rein your Shantak when the first note lures. Look then back to 3
earth, and you will see shining the deathless altar-flame of Ired-Naa from the 3
sacred roof of a temple. That temple is in your desiderate sunset city, so steer for 3
it before you heed the singing and are lost. 3
3
"When you draw nigh the city steer for the same high parapet whence of old you 3
scanned the outspread glory, prodding the Shantak till he cry aloud. That cry the 3
Great Ones will hear and know as they sit on their perfumed terraces, and there 3
will come upon them such a homesickness that all of your city's wonders will not 3
console them for the absence of Kadath's grim castle and the pshent of eternal 3
stars that crowns it. 3
3
"Then must you land amongst them with the Shantak, and let them see and 3
touch that noisome and hippocephalic bird; meanwhile discoursing to them of 3
unknown Kadath, which you will so lately have left, and telling them how its 3
boundless halls are lovely and unlighted, where of old they used to leap and 3
revel in supernal radiance. And the Shantak will talk to them in the manner of 3
Shantaks, but it will have no powers of persuasion beyond the recalling of elder 3
days. 3
3
"Over and over must you speak to the wandering Great Ones of their home and 3
youth, till at last they will weep and ask to be shewn the returning path they 3
have forgotten. Thereat can you loose the waiting Shantak, sending him skyward 3
with the homing cry of his kind; hearing which the Great Ones will prance and 3
jump with antique mirth, and forthwith stride after the loathly bird in the fashion 3
of gods, through the deep gulfs of heaven to Kadath's familiar towers and 3
domes. 3
3
"Then will the marvellous sunset city be yours to cherish and inhabit for ever, 3
and once more will earth's gods rule the dreams of men from their accustomed 3
seat. Go now - the casement is open and the stars await outside. Already your 3
Shantak wheezes and titters with impatience. Steer for Vega through the night, 3
but turn when the singing sounds. Forget not this warning, lest horrors 3
unthinkable suck you into the gulf of shrieking and ululant madness. Remember 3
the Other Gods; they are great and mindless and terrible, and lurk in the outer 3
voids. They are good gods to shun. 3
3
"Hei! Aa-shanta 'nygh! You are off! Send back earth's gods to their haunts on 3
unknown Kadath, and pray to all space that you may never meet me in my 3
thousand other forms. Farewell, Randolph Carter, and beware; for I am 3
Nyarlathotep, the Crawling Chaos." 3
3
3
3
513 3
3
3
3
And Randolph Carter, gasping and dizzy on his hideous Shantak, shot 3
screamingly into space toward the cold blue glare of boreal Vega; looking but 3
once behind him at the clustered and chaotic turrets of the onyx nightmare 3
wherein still glowed the lone lurid light of that window above the air and the 3
clouds of earth's dreamland. Great polypous horrors slid darkly past, and 3
unseen bat wings beat multitudinous around him, but still he clung to the 3
unwholesome mane of that loathly and hippocephalic scaled bird. The stars 3
danced mockingly, almost shifting now and then to form pale signs of doom that 3
one might wonder one had not seen and feared before; and ever the winds of 3
nether howled of vague blackness and loneliness beyond the cosmos. 3
3
Then through the glittering vault ahead there fell a hush of portent, and all the 3
winds and horrors slunk away as night things slink away before the dawn. 3
Trembling in waves that golden wisps of nebula made weirdly visible, there rose 3
a timid hint of far-off melody, droning in faint chords that our own universe of 3
stars knows not. And as that music grew, the Shantak raised its ears and plunged 3
ahead, and Carter likewise bent to catch each lovely strain. It was a song, but not 3
the song of any voice. Night and the spheres sang it, and it was old when space 3
and Nyarlathotep and the Other Gods were born. 3
3
Faster flew the Shantak, and lower bent the rider, drunk with the marvel of 3
strange gulfs, and whirling in the crystal coils of outer magic. Then came too late 3
the warning of the evil one, the sardonic caution of the daemon legate who had 3
bidden the seeker beware the madness of that song. Only to taunt had 3
Nyarlathotep marked out the way to safety and the marvellous sunset city; only 3
to mock had that black messenger revealed the secret of these truant gods whose 3
steps he could so easily lead back at will. For madness and the void's wild 3
vengeance are Nyarlathotep's only gifts to the presumptuous; and frantick 3
though the rider strove to turn his disgusting steed, that leering, tittering Shantak 3
coursed on impetuous and relentless, flapping its great slippery wings in 3
malignant joy and headed for those unhallowed pits whither no dreams reach; 3
that last amorphous blight of nether-most confusion where bubbles and 3
blasphemes at infinity's centre the mindless daemon-sultan Azathoth, whose 3
name no lips dare speak aloud. 3
3
Unswerving and obedient to the foul legate's orders, that hellish bird plunged 3
onward through shoals of shapeless lurkers and caperers in darkness, and 3
vacuous herds of drifting entities that pawed and groped and groped and 3
pawed; the nameless larvae of the Other Gods, that are like them blind and 3
without mind, and possessed of singular hungers and thirsts 3
3
Onward unswerving and relentless, and tittering hilariously to watch the 3
chuckling and hysterics into which the risen song of night and the spheres had 3
3
3
3
514 3
3
3
3
turned, that eldritch scaly monster bore its helpless rider; hurtling and shooting, 3
cleaving the uttermost rim and spanning the outermost abysses; leaving behind 3
the stars and the realms of matter, and darting meteor-like through stark 3
formlessness toward those inconceivable, unlighted chambers beyond time 3
wherein Azathoth gnaws shapeless and ravenous amidst the muffled, 3
maddening beat of vile drums and the thin, monotonous whine of accursed 3
flutes. 3
3
Onward - onward - through the screaming, cackling, and blackly populous gulfs 3
- and then from some dim blessed distance there came an image and a thought to 3
Randolph Carter the doomed. Too well had Nyarlathotep planned his mocking 3
and his tantalising, for he had brought up that which no gusts of icy terror could 3
quite efface. Home - New England - Beacon Hill - the waking world. 3
3
"For know you, that your gold and marble city of wonder is only the sum of 3
what you have seen and loved in youth. . . the glory of Boston's hillside roofs and 3
western windows aflame with sunset; of the flower-fragrant Common and the 3
great dome on the hill and the tangle of gables and chimneys in the violet valley 3
where the many -bridged Charles flows drowsily... this loveliness, moulded, 3
crystallised, and polished by years of memory and dreaming, is your terraced 3
wonder of elusive sunsets; and to find that marble parapet with curious urns and 3
carven rail, and descend at last those endless balustraded steps to the city of 3
broad squares and prismatic fountains, you need only to turn back to the 3
thoughts and visions of your wistful boyhood." 3
3
Onward - onward - dizzily onward to ultimate doom through the blackness 3
where sightless feelers pawed and slimy snouts jostled and nameless things 3
tittered and tittered and tittered. But the image and the thought had come, and 3
Randolph Carter knew clearly that he was dreaming and only dreaming, and 3
that somewhere in the background the world of waking and the city of his 3
infancy still lay. Words came again - "You need only turn back to the thoughts 3
and visions of your wistful boyhood." Turn - turn - blackness on every side, but 3
Randolph Carter could turn. 3
3
Thick though the rushing nightmare that clutched his senses, Randolph Carter 3
could turn and move. He could move, and if he chose he could leap off the evil 3
Shantak that bore him hurtlingly doomward at the orders of Nyarlathotep. He 3
could leap off and dare those depths of night that yawned interminably down, 3
those depths of fear whose terrors yet could not exceed the nameless doom that 3
lurked waiting at chaos' core. He could turn and move and leap - he could - he 3
would - he would - he would. 3
3
3
3
515 3
3
3
3
Off that vast hippocephalic abomination leaped the doomed and desperate 3
dreamer, and down through endless voids of sentient blackness he fell. Aeons 3
reeled, universes died and were born again, stars became nebulae and nebulae 3
became stars, and still Randolph Carter fell through those endless voids of 3
sentient blackness. 3
3
Then in the slow creeping course of eternity the utmost cycle of the cosmos 3
churned itself into another futile completion, and all things became again as they 3
were unreckoned kalpas before. Matter and light were born anew as space once 3
had known them; and comets, suns and worlds sprang flaming into life, though 3
nothing survived to tell that they had been and gone, been and gone, always and 3
always, back to no first beginning. 3
3
And there was a firmament again, and a wind, and a glare of purple light in the 3
eyes of the falling dreamer. There were gods and presences and wills; beauty and 3
evil, and the shrieking of noxious night robbed of its prey. For through the 3
unknown ultimate cycle had lived a thought and a vision of a dreamer's 3
boyhood, and now there were remade a waking world and an old cherished city 3
to body and to justify these things. Out of the void S'ngac the violet gas had 3
pointed the way, and archaic Nodens was bellowing his guidance from unhinted 3
deeps. 3
3
Stars swelled to dawns, and dawns burst into fountains of gold, carmine, and 3
purple, and still the dreamer fell. Cries rent the aether as ribbons of light beat 3
back the fiends from outside. And hoary Nodens raised a howl of triumph when 3
Nyarlathotep, close on his quarry, stopped baffled by a glare that seared his 3
formless hunting-horrors to grey dust. Randolph Carter had indeed descended at 3
last the wide marmoreal flights to his marvellous city, for he was come again to 3
the fair New England world that had wrought him. 3
3
So to the organ chords of morning's myriad whistles, and dawn's blaze thrown 3
dazzling through purple panes by the great gold dome of the State House on the 3
hill, Randolph Carter leaped shoutingly awake within his Boston room. Birds 3
sang in hidden gardens and the perfume of trellised vines came wistful from 3
arbours his grandfather had reared. Beauty and light glowed from classic mantel 3
and carven cornice and walls grotesquely figured, while a sleek black cat rose 3
yawning from hearthside sleep that his master's start and shriek had disturbed. 3
And vast infinities away, past the Gate of Deeper Slumber and the enchanted 3
wood and the garden lands and the Cerenarian Sea and the twilight reaches of 3
Inquanok, the crawling chaos Nyarlathotep strode brooding into the onyx castle 3
atop unknown Kadath in the cold waste, and taunted insolently the mild gods of 3
earth whom he had snatched abruptly from their scented revels in the 3
marvellous sunset city. 3

The Dunwich Horror 3
3
Written in 1928 3
3
Published in April 1929 in Weird Tales 3
3
Gorgons and Hydras, and Chimaeras - dire stories of Celaeno and the Harpies - 3
may reproduce themselves in the brain of superstition - but they were there 3
before. They are transcripts, types - the archtypes are in us, and eternal. How else 3
should the recital of that which we know in a waking sense to be false come to 3
affect us all? Is it that we naturally conceive terror from such objects, considered 3
in their capacity of being able to inflict upon us bodily injury? O, least of all! 3
These terrors are of older standing. They date beyond body - or without the 3
body, they would have been the same... That the kind of fear here treated is 3
purely spiritual - that it is strong in proportion as it is objectless on earth, that it 3
predominates in the period of our sinless infancy - are difficulties the solution of 3
which might afford some probable insight into our ante-mundane condition, and 3
a peep at least into the shadowland of pre-existence. 3
3
- Charles Lamb: Witches and Other Night-Fears 3
3
3
3
When a traveller in north central Massachusetts takes the wrong fork at the 3
junction of Aylesbury pike just beyond Dean's Corners he comes upon a lonely 3
and curious country. 3
3
The ground gets higher, and the brier-bordered stone walls press closer and 3
closer against the ruts of the dusty, curving road. The trees of the frequent forest 3
belts seem too large, and the wild weeds, brambles and grasses attain a 3
luxuriance not often found in settled regions. At the same time the planted fields 3
appear singularly few and barren; while the sparsely scattered houses wear a 3
surprisingly uniform aspect of age, squalor, and dilapidation. 3
3
Without knowing why, one hesitates to ask directions from the gnarled solitary 3
figures spied now and then on crumbling doorsteps or on the sloping, rock- 3
strewn meadows. Those figures are so silent and furtive that one feels somehow 3
confronted by forbidden things, with which it would be better to have nothing to 3
do. When a rise in the road brings the mountains in view above the deep woods, 3
the feeling of strange uneasiness is increased. The summits are too rounded and 3
symmetrical to give a sense of comfort and naturalness, and sometimes the sky 3
silhouettes with especial clearness the queer circles of tall stone pillars with 3
which most of them are crowned. 3
3
3
3
518 3
3
3
3
Gorges and ravines of problematical depth intersect the way, and the crude 3
wooden bridges always seem of dubious safety. When the road dips again there 3
are stretches of marshland that one instinctively dislikes, and indeed almost fears 3
at evening when unseen whippoorwills chatter and the fireflies come out in 3
abnormal profusion to dance to the raucous, creepily insistent rhythms of 3
stridently piping bull-frogs. The thin, shining line of the Miskatonic's upper 3
reaches has an oddly serpent-like suggestion as it winds close to the feet of the 3
domed hills among which it rises. 3
3
As the hills draw nearer, one heeds their wooded sides more than their stone- 3
crowned tops. Those sides loom up so darkly and precipitously that one wishes 3
they would keep their distance, but there is no road by which to escape them. 3
Across a covered bridge one sees a small village huddled between the stream 3
and the vertical slope of Round Mountain, and wonders at the cluster of rotting 3
gambrel roofs bespeaking an earlier architectural period than that of the 3
neighbouring region. It is not reassuring to see, on a closer glance, that most of 3
the houses are deserted and falling to ruin, and that the broken-steepled church 3
now harbours the one slovenly mercantile establishment of the hamlet. One 3
dreads to trust the tenebrous tunnel of the bridge, yet there is no way to avoid it. 3
Once across, it is hard to prevent the impression of a faint, malign odour about 3
the village street, as of the massed mould and decay of centuries. It is always a 3
relief to get clear of the place, and to follow the narrow road around the base of 3
the hills and across the level country beyond till it rejoins the Aylesbury pike. 3
Afterwards one sometimes learns that one has been through Dunwich. 3
3
Outsiders visit Dunwich as seldom as possible, and since a certain season of 3
horror all the signboards pointing towards it have been taken down. The 3
scenery, judged by an ordinary aesthetic canon, is more than commonly 3
beautiful; yet there is no influx of artists or summer tourists. Two centuries ago, 3
when talk of witch-blood, Satan-worship, and strange forest presences was not 3
laughed at, it was the custom to give reasons for avoiding the locality. In our 3
sensible age - since the Dunwich horror of 1928 was hushed up by those who had 3
the town's and the world's welfare at heart - people shun it without knowing 3
exactly why. Perhaps one reason - though it cannot apply to uninformed 3
strangers - is that the natives are now repellently decadent, having gone far along 3
that path of retrogression so common in many New England backwaters. They 3
have come to form a race by themselves, with the well-defined mental and 3
physical stigmata of degeneracy and inbreeding. The average of their intelligence 3
is woefully low, whilst their annals reek of overt viciousness and of half-hidden 3
murders, incests, and deeds of almost unnameable violence and perversity. The 3
old gentry, representing the two or three armigerous families which came from 3
Salem in 1692, have kept somewhat above the general level of decay; though 3
many branches are sunk into the sordid populace so deeply that only their names 3
3
3
3
519 3
3
3
3
remain as a key to the origin they disgrace. Some of the Whateleys and Bishops 3
still send their eldest sons to Harvard and Miskatonic, though those sons seldom 3
return to the mouldering gambrel roofs under which they and their ancestors 3
were born. 3
3
No one, even those who have the facts concerning the recent horror, can say just 3
what is the matter with Dunwich; though old legends speak of unhallowed rites 3
and conclaves of the Indians, amidst which they called forbidden shapes of 3
shadow out of the great rounded hills, and made wild orgiastic prayers that were 3
answered by loud crackings and rumblings from the ground below. In 1747 the 3
Reverend Abijah Hoadley, newly come to the Congregational Church at 3
Dunwich Village, preached a memorable sermon on the close presence of Satan 3
and his imps; in which he said: 3
3
"It must be allow'd, that these Blasphemies of an infernall Train of Daemons are 3
Matters of too common Knowledge to be deny'd; the cursed Voices of Azazel 3
and Buzrael, of Beelzebub and Belial, being heard now from under Ground by 3
above a Score of credible Witnesses now living. I myself did not more than a 3
Fortnight ago catch a very plain Discourse of evill Powers in the Hill behind my 3
House; wherein there were a Rattling and Rolling, Groaning, Screeching, and 3
Hissing, such as no Things of this Earth could raise up, and which must needs 3
have come from those Caves that only black Magick can discover, and only the 3
Divell unlock". 3
3
Mr. Hoadley disappeared soon after delivering this sermon, but the text, printed 3
in Springfield, is still extant. Noises in the hills continued to be reported from 3
year to year, and still form a puzzle to geologists and physiographers. 3
3
Other traditions tell of foul odours near the hill-crowning circles of stone pillars, 3
and of rushing airy presences to be heard faintly at certain hours from stated 3
points at the bottom of the great ravines; while still others try to explain the 3
Devil's Hop Yard - a bleak, blasted hillside where no tree, shrub, or grass-blade 3
will grow. Then, too, the natives are mortally afraid of the numerous 3
whippoorwills which grow vocal on warm nights. It is vowed that the birds are 3
psychopomps lying in wait for the souls of the dying, and that they time their 3
eerie cries in unison with the sufferer's struggling breath. If they can catch the 3
fleeing soul when it leaves the body, they instantly flutter away chittering in 3
daemoniac laughter; but if they fail, they subside gradually into a disappointed 3
silence. 3
3
These tales, of course, are obsolete and ridiculous; because they come down from 3
very old times. Dunwich is indeed ridiculously old - older by far than any of the 3
communities within thirty miles of it. South of the village one may still spy the 3
3
3
3
520 3
3
3
3
cellar walls and chimney of the ancient Bishop house, which was built before 3
1700; whilst the ruins of the mill at the falls, built in 1806, form the most modern 3
piece of architecture to be seen. Industry did not flourish here, and the 3
nineteenth-century factory movement proved short-lived. Oldest of all are the 3
great rings of rough-hewn stone columns on the hilltops, but these are more 3
generally attributed to the Indians than to the settlers. Deposits of skulls and 3
bones, found within these circles and around the sizeable table-like rock on 3
Sentinel Hill, sustain the popular belief that such spots were once the burial- 3
places of the Pocumtucks; even though many ethnologists, disregarding the 3
absurd improbability of such a theory, persist in believing the remains 3
Caucasian. 3
3
II. 3
3
It was in the township of Dunwich, in a large and partly inhabited farmhouse set 3
against a hillside four miles from the village and a mile and a half from any other 3
dwelling, that Wilbur Whateley was born at 5 a.m. on Sunday, the second of 3
February, 1913. This date was recalled because it was Candlemas, which people 3
in Dunwich curiously observe under another name; and because the noises in the 3
hills had sounded, and all the dogs of the countryside had barked persistently, 3
throughout the night before. Less worthy of notice was the fact that the mother 3
was one of the decadent Whateleys, a somewhat deformed, unattractive albino 3
woman of thirty-five, living with an aged and half-insane father about whom the 3
most frightful tales of wizardry had been whispered in his youth. Lavinia 3
Whateley had no known husband, but according to the custom of the region 3
made no attempt to disavow the child; concerning the other side of whose 3
ancestry the country folk might - and did - speculate as widely as they chose. On 3
the contrary, she seemed strangely proud of the dark, goatish-looking infant who 3
formed such a contrast to her own sickly and pink-eyed albinism, and was heard 3
to mutter many curious prophecies about its unusual powers and tremendous 3
future. 3
3
Lavinia was one who would be apt to mutter such things, for she was a lone 3
creature given to wandering amidst thunderstorms in the hills and trying to read 3
the great odorous books which her father had inherited through two centuries of 3
Whateleys, and which were fast falling to pieces with age and wormholes. She 3
had never been to school, but was filled with disjointed scraps of ancient lore 3
that Old Whateley had taught her. The remote farmhouse had always been 3
feared because of Old Whateley's reputation for black magic, and the 3
unexplained death by violence of Mrs Whateley when Lavinia was twelve years 3
old had not helped to make the place popular. Isolated among strange 3
influences, Lavinia was fond of wild and grandiose day-dreams and singular 3
3
3
3

3
3
3
occupations; nor was her leisure much taken up by household cares in a home 3
from which all standards of order and cleanliness had long since disappeared. 3
3
There was a hideous screaming which echoed above even the hill noises and the 3
dogs' barking on the night Wilbur was born, but no known doctor or midwife 3
presided at his coming. Neighbours knew nothing of him till a week afterward, 3
when Old Wateley drove his sleigh through the snow into Dunwich Village and 3
discoursed incoherently to the group of loungers at Osborne's general store. 3
There seemed to be a change in the old man - an added element of furtiveness in 3
the clouded brain which subtly transformed him from an object to a subject of 3
fear - though he was not one to be perturbed by any common family event. 3
Amidst it all he showed some trace of the pride later noticed in his daughter, and 3
what he said of the child's paternity was remembered by many of his hearers 3
years afterward. 3
3
'I dun't keer what folks think - ef Lavinny's boy looked like his pa, he wouldn't 3
look like nothin' ye expeck. Ye needn't think the only folks is the folks 3
hereabouts. Lavinny's read some, an' has seed some things the most o' ye only 3
tell abaout. I calc'late her man is as good a husban' as ye kin find this side of 3
Aylesbury; an' ef ye knowed as much abaout the hills as I dew, ye wouldn't ast 3
no better church weddin' nor her'n. Let me tell ye suthin - some day yew folks'U 3
hear a child o' Lavinny's a-callin' its father's name on the top o' Sentinel Hill!' 3
3
The only person who saw Wilbur during the first month of his life were old 3
Zechariah Whateley, of the undecayed Whateleys, and Earl Sawyer's common- 3
law wife, Mamie Bishop. Mamie's visit was frankly one of curiosity, and her 3
subsequent tales did justice to her observations; but Zechariah came to lead a 3
pair of Alderney cows which Old Whateley had bought of his son Curtis. This 3
marked the beginning of a course of cattle-buying on the part of small Wilbur's 3
family which ended only in 1928, when the Dunwich horror came and went; yet 3
at no time did the ramshackle Wateley barn seem overcrowded with livestock. 3
There came a period when people were curious enough to steal up and count the 3
herd that grazed precariously on the steep hillside above the old farm-house, and 3
they could never find more than ten or twelve anaemic, bloodless-looking 3
specimens. Evidently some blight or distemper, perhaps sprung from the 3
unwholesome pasturage or the diseased fungi and timbers of the filthy barn, 3
caused a heavy mortality amongst the Whateley animals. Odd wounds or sores, 3
having something of the aspect of incisions, seemed to afflict the visible cattle; 3
and once or twice during the earlier months certain callers fancied they could 3
discern similar sores about the throats of the grey, unshaven old man and his 3
slatternly, crinkly-haired albino daughter. 3
3
3

3
In the spring after Wilbur's birth Lavinia resumed her customary rambles in the 3
hills, bearing in her misproportioned arms the swarthy child. Public interest in 3
the Whateleys subsided after most of the country folk had seen the baby, and no 3
one bothered to comment on the swift development which that newcomer 3
seemed every day to exhibit. Wilbur's growth was indeed phenomenal, for 3
within three months of his birth he had attained a size and muscular power not 3
usually found in infants under a full year of age. His motions and even his vocal 3
sounds showed a restraint and deliberateness highly peculiar in an infant, and no 3
one was really unprepared when, at seven months, he began to walk unassisted, 3
with falterings which another month was sufficient to remove. 3
3
It was somewhat after this time - on Hallowe'en - that a great blaze was seen at 3
midnight on the top of Sentinel Hill where the old table-like stone stands amidst 3
its tumulus of ancient bones. Considerable talk was started when Silas Bishop - 3
of the undecayed Bishops - mentioned having seen the boy running sturdily up 3
that hill ahead of his mother about an hour before the blaze was remarked. Silas 3
was rounding up a stray heifer, but he nearly forgot his mission when he 3
fleetingly spied the two figures in the dim light of his lantern. They darted 3
almost noiselessly through the underbrush, and the astonished watcher seemed 3
to think they were entirely unclothed. Afterwards he could not be sure about the 3
boy, who may have had some kind of a fringed belt and a pair of dark trunks or 3
trousers on. Wilbur was never subsequently seen alive and conscious without 3
complete and tightly buttoned attire, the disarrangement or threatened 3
disarrangement of which always seemed to fill him with anger and alarm. His 3
contrast with his squalid mother and grandfather in this respect was thought 3
very notable until the horror of 1928 suggested the most valid of reasons. 3
3
The next January gossips were mildly interested in the fact that 'Lavinny's black 3
brat' had commenced to talk, and at the age of only eleven months. His speech 3
was somewhat remarkable both because of its difference from the ordinary 3
accents of the region, and because it displayed a freedom from infantile lisping of 3
which many children of three or four might well be proud. The boy was not 3
talkative, yet when he spoke he seemed to reflect some elusive element wholly 3
unpossessed by Dunwich and its denizens. The strangeness did not reside in 3
what he said, or even in the simple idioms he used; but seemed vaguely linked 3
with his intonation or with the internal organs that produced the spoken sounds. 3
His facial aspect, too, was remarkable for its maturity; for though he shared his 3
mother's and grandfather's chinlessness, his firm and precociously shaped nose 3
united with the expression of his large, dark, almost Latin eyes to give him an air 3
of quasi-adulthood and well-nigh preternatural intelligence. He was, however, 3
exceedingly ugly despite his appearance of brilliancy; there being something 3
almost goatish or animalistic about his thick lips, large-pored, yellowish skin, 3
coarse crinkly hair, and oddly elongated ears. He was soon disliked even more 3
3
3
3
523 3
3
3
3
decidedly than his mother and grandsire, and all conjectures about him were 3
spiced with references to the bygone magic of Old Whateley, and how the hills 3
once shook when he shrieked the dreadful name of Yog-Sothoth in the midst of a 3
circle of stones with a great book open in his arms before him. Dogs abhorred the 3
boy, and he was always obliged to take various defensive measures against their 3
barking menace. 3
3
III. 3
3
Meanwhile Old Whateley continued to buy cattle without measurably increasing 3
the size of his herd. He also cut timber and began to repair the unused parts of 3
his house - a spacious, peak-roofed affair whose rear end was buried entirely in 3
the rocky hillside, and whose three least-ruined ground-floor rooms had always 3
been sufficient for himself and his daughter. 3
3
There must have been prodigious reserves of strength in the old man to enable 3
him to accomplish so much hard labour; and though he still babbled dementedly 3
at times, his carpentry seemed to show the effects of sound calculation. It had 3
already begun as soon as Wilbur was born, when one of the many tool sheds had 3
been put suddenly in order, clapboarded, and fitted with a stout fresh lock. Now, 3
in restoring the abandoned upper storey of the house, he was a no less thorough 3
craftsman. His mania showed itself only in his tight boarding-up of all the 3
windows in the reclaimed section - though many declared that it was a crazy 3
thing to bother with the reclamation at all. 3
3
Less inexplicable was his fitting up of another downstairs room for his new 3
grandson - a room which several callers saw, though no one was ever admitted 3
to the closely-boarded upper storey. This chamber he lined with tall, firm 3
shelving, along which he began gradually to arrange, in apparently careful order, 3
all the rotting ancient books and parts of books which during his own day had 3
been heaped promiscuously in odd corners of the various rooms. 3
3
'I made some use of 'em,' he would say as he tried to mend a torn black-letter 3
page with paste prepared on the rusty kitchen stove, 'but the boy's fitten to make 3
better use of 'em. He'd orter hev 'em as well so as he kin, for they're goin' to be 3
all of his larnin'.' 3
3
When Wilbur was a year and seven months old - in September of 1914 - his size 3
and accomplishments were almost alarming. He had grown as large as a child of 3
four, and was a fluent and incredibly intelligent talker. He ran freely about the 3
fields and hills, and accompanied his mother on all her wanderings. At home he 3
would pore dilligently over the queer pictures and charts in his grandfather's 3
books, while Old Whateley would instruct and catechize him through long. 3
3
3
3
524 3
3
3
3
hushed afternoons. By this time the restoration of the house was finished, and 3
those who watched it wondered why one of the upper windows had been made 3
into a sohd plank door. It was a window in the rear of the east gable end, close 3
against the hill; and no one could imagine why a cleated wooden runway was 3
built up to it from the ground. About the period of this work's completion people 3
noticed that the old tool-house, tightly locked and windowlessly clapboarded 3
since Wilbur's birth, had been abandoned again. The door swung listlessly open, 3
and when Earl Sawyer once stepped within after a cattle-selling call on Old 3
Whateley he was quite discomposed by the singular odour he encountered - such 3
a stench, he averred, as he had never before smelt in all his life except near the 3
Indian circles on the hills, and which could not come from anything sane or of 3
this earth. But then, the homes and sheds of Dunwich folk have never been 3
remarkable for olfactory immaculateness. 3
3
The following months were void of visible events, save that everyone swore to a 3
slow but steady increase in the mysterious hill noises. On May Eve of 1915 there 3
were tremors which even the Aylesbury people felt, whilst the following 3
Hallowe'en produced an underground rumbling queerly synchronized with 3
bursts of flame - 'them witch Whateleys' doin's' - from the summit of Sentinel 3
Hill. Wilbur was growing up uncannily, so that he looked like a boy of ten as he 3
entered his fourth year. He read avidly by himself now; but talked much less 3
than formerly. A settled taciturnity was absorbing him, and for the first time 3
people began to speak specifically of the dawning look of evil in his goatish face. 3
He would sometimes mutter an unfamiliar jargon, and chant in bizarre rhythms 3
which chilled the listener with a sense of unexplainable terror. The aversion 3
displayed towards him by dogs had now become a matter of wide remark, and 3
he was obliged to carry a pistol in order to traverse the countryside in safety. His 3
occasional use of the weapon did not enhance his popularity amongst the owners 3
of canine guardians. 3
3
The few callers at the house would often find Lavinia alone on the ground floor, 3
while odd cries and footsteps resounded in the boarded-up second storey. She 3
would never tell what her father and the boy were doing up there, though once 3
she turned pale and displayed an abnormal degree of fear when a jocose fish- 3
pedlar tried the locked door leading to the stairway. That pedlar told the store 3
loungers at Dunwich Village that he thought he heard a horse stamping on that 3
floor above. The loungers reflected, thinking of the door and runway, and of the 3
cattle that so swiftly disappeared. Then they shuddered as they recalled tales of 3
Old Whateley's youth, and of the strange things that are called out of the earth 3
when a bullock is sacrificed at the proper time to certain heathen gods. It had for 3
some time been noticed that dogs had begun to hate and fear the whole 3
Whateley place as violently as they hated and feared young Wilbur personally. 3
3
3
3
525 3
3
3
3
In 1917 the war came, and Squire Sawyer Whateley, as chairman of the local draft 3
board, had hard work finding a quota of young Dunwich men fit even to be sent 3
to development camp. The government, alarmed at such signs of wholesale 3
regional decadence, sent several officers and medical experts to investigate; 3
conducting a survey which New England newspaper readers may still recall. It 3
was the publicity attending this investigation which set reporters on the track of 3
the Whateleys, and caused the Boston Globe and Arkham Advertiser to print 3
flamboyant Sunday stories of young Wilbur's precociousness. Old Whateley's 3
black magic, and the shelves of strange books, the sealed second storey of the 3
ancient farmhouse, and the weirdness of the whole region and its hill noises. 3
Wilbur was four and a half then, and looked like a lad of fifteen. His lips and 3
cheeks were fuzzy with a coarse dark down, and his voice had begun to break. 3
3
Earl Sawyer went out to the Whateley place with both sets of reporters and 3
camera men, and called their attention to the queer stench which now seemed to 3
trickle down from the sealed upper spaces. It was, he said, exactly like a smell he 3
had found in the toolshed abandoned when the house was finally repaired; and 3
like the faint odours which he sometimes thought he caught near the stone circle 3
on the mountains. Dunwich folk read the stories when they appeared, and 3
grinned over the obvious mistakes. They wondered, too, why the writers made 3
so much of the fact that Old Whateley always paid for his cattle in gold pieces of 3
extremely ancient date. The Whateleys had received their visitors with ill- 3
concealed distaste, though they did not dare court further publicity by a violent 3
resistance or refusal to talk. 3
3
IV. 3
3
For a decade the annals of the Whateleys sink indistinguishably into the general 3
life of a morbid community used to their queer ways and hardened to their May 3
Eve and All-Hallows orgies. Twice a year they would light fires on the top of 3
Sentinel Hill, at which times the mountain rumblings would recur with greater 3
and greater violence; while at all seasons there were strange and portentous 3
doings at the lonely farm-house. In the course of time callers professed to hear 3
sounds in the sealed upper storey even when all the family were downstairs, and 3
they wondered how swiftly or how lingeringly a cow or bullock was usually 3
sacrificed. There was talk of a complaint to the Society for the Prevention of 3
Cruelty to Animals but nothing ever came of it, since Dunwich folk are never 3
anxious to call the outside world's attention to themselves. 3
3
About 1923, when Wilbur was a boy of ten whose mind, voice, stature, and 3
bearded face gave all the impressions of maturity, a second great siege of 3
carpentry went on at the old house. It was all inside the sealed upper part, and 3
from bits of discarded lumber people concluded that the youth and his 3
3
3
3
526 3
3
3
3
grandfather had knocked out all the partitions and even removed the attic floor, 3
leaving only one vast open void between the ground storey and the peaked roof. 3
They had torn down the great central chimney, too, and fitted the rusty range 3
with a flimsy outside tin stove-pipe. 3
3
In the spring after this event Old Whateley noticed the growing number of 3
whippoorwills that would come out of Cold Spring Glen to chirp under his 3
window at night. He seemed to regard the circumstance as one of great 3
significance, and told the loungers at Osborn's that he thought his time had 3
almost come. 3
3
'They whistle jest in tune with my breathin' naow,' he said, 'an' I guess they're 3
gittin' ready to ketch my soul. They know it's a-goin' aout, an' dun't calc'late to 3
miss it. Yew'll know, boys, arter I'm gone, whether they git me er not. Ef they 3
dew, they'll keep up a-singin' an' laffin' till break o' day. Ef they dun't they'll 3
kinder quiet daown like. I expeck them an' the souls they hunts fer hev some 3
pretty tough tussles sometimes.' 3
3
On Lammas Night, 1924, Dr Houghton of Aylesbury was hastily summoned by 3
Wilbur Whateley, who had lashed his one remaining horse through the darkness 3
and telephoned from Osborn's in the village. He found Old Whateley in a very 3
grave state, with a cardiac action and stertorous breathing that told of an end not 3
far off. The shapeless albino daughter and oddly bearded grandson stood by the 3
bedside, whilst from the vacant abyss overhead there came a disquieting 3
suggestion of rhythmical surging or lapping, as of the waves on some level 3
beach. The doctor, though, was chiefly disturbed by the chattering night birds 3
outside; a seemingly limitless legion of whippoorwills that cried their endless 3
message in repetitions timed diabolically to the wheezing gasps of the dying 3
man. It was uncanny and unnatural - too much, thought Dr Houghton, like the 3
whole of the region he had entered so reluctantly in response to the urgent call. 3
3
Towards one o'clock Old Whateley gained consciousness, and interrupted his 3
wheezing to choke out a few words to his grandson. 3
3
'More space, Willy, more space soon. Yew grows - an' that grows faster. It'll be 3
ready to serve ye soon, boy. Open up the gates to Yog-Sothoth with the long 3
chant that ye'U find on page 751 of the complete edition, an' then put a match to 3
the prison. Fire from airth can't burn it nohaow.' 3
3
He was obviously quite mad. After a pause, during which the flock of 3
whippoorwills outside adjusted their cries to the altered tempo while some 3
indications of the strange hill noises came from afar off, he added another 3
sentence or two. 3
3
3
3
527 3
3
3
3
'Feed it reg'lar, Willy, an' mind the quantity; but dun't let it grow too fast fer the 3
place, fer ef it busts quarters or gits aout afore ye opens to Yog-Sothoth, it's all 3
over an' no use. Only them from beyont kin make it multiply an' work... Only 3
them, the old uns as wants to come back. . .' 3
3
But speech gave place to gasps again, and Lavinia screamed at the way the 3
whippoorwills followed the change. It was the same for more than an hour, 3
when the final throaty rattle came. Dr Houghton drew shrunken lids over the 3
glazing grey eyes as the tumult of birds faded imperceptibly to silence. Lavinia 3
sobbed, but Wilbur only chuckled whilst the hill noises rumbled faintly. 3
3
'They didn't git him,' he muttered in his heavy bass voice. 3
3
Wilbur was by this time a scholar of really tremendous erudition in his one-sided 3
way, and was quietly known by correspondence to many librarians in distant 3
places where rare and forbidden books of old days are kept. He was more and 3
more hated and dreaded around Dunwich because of certain youthful 3
disappearances which suspicion laid vaguely at his door; but was always able to 3
silence inquiry through fear or through use of that fund of old-time gold which 3
still, as in his grandfather's time, went forth regularly and increasingly for cattle- 3
buying. He was now tremendously mature of aspect, and his height, having 3
reached the normal adult limit, seemed inclined to wax beyond that figure. In 3
1925, when a scholarly correspondent from Miskatonic University called upon 3
him one day and departed pale and puzzled, he was fully six and three-quarters 3
feet tall. 3
3
Through all the years Wilbur had treated his half-deformed albino mother with a 3
growing contempt, finally forbidding her to go to the hills with him on May Eve 3
and Hallowmass; and in 1926 the poor creature complained to Mamie Bishop of 3
being afraid of him. 3
3
'They's more abaout him as I knows than I kin tell ye, Mamie,' she said, 'an' 3
naowadays they's more nor what I know myself. I vaow afur Gawd, I dun't 3
know what he wants nor what he's a-tryin' to dew.' 3
3
That Hallowe'en the hill noises sounded louder than ever, and fire burned on 3
Sentinel Hill as usual; but people paid more attention to the rhythmical 3
screaming of vast flocks of unnaturally belated whippoorwills which seemed to 3
be assembled near the unlighted Whateley farmhouse. After midnight their shrill 3
notes burst into a kind of pandemoniac cachinnation which filled all the 3
countryside, and not until dawn did they finally quiet down. Then they 3
vanished, hurrying southward where they were fully a month overdue. What 3
this meant, no one could quite be certain till later. None of the countryfolk 3
3
3
3
528 3
3
3
3
seemed to have died - but poor Lavinia Whateley, the twisted albino, was never 3
seen again. 3
3
In the summer of 1927 Wilbur repaired two sheds in the farmyard and began 3
moving his books and effects out to them. Soon afterwards Earl Sawyer told the 3
loungers at Osborn's that more carpentry was going on in the Whateley 3
farmhouse. Wilbur was closing all the doors and windows on the ground floor, 3
and seemed to be taking out partitions as he and his grandfather had done 3
upstairs four years before. He was living in one of the sheds, and Sawyer thought 3
he seemed unusually worried and tremulous. People generally suspected him of 3
knowing something about his mother disappearance, and very few ever 3
approached his neighbourhood now. His height had increased to more than 3
seven feet, and showed no signs of ceasing its development. 3
3
V. 3
3
The following winter brought an event no less strange than Wilbur's first trip 3
outside the Dunwich region. Correspondence with the Widener Library at 3
Harvard, the Bibliotheque Nationale in Paris, the British Museum, the University 3
of Buenos Ayres, and the Library of Miskatonic University at Arkham had failed 3
to get him the loan of a book he desperately wanted; so at length he set out in 3
person, shabby, dirty, bearded, and uncouth of dialect, to consult the copy at 3
Miskatonic, which was the nearest to him geographically. Almost eight feet tall, 3
and carrying a cheap new valise from Osborne's general store, this dark and 3
goatish gargoyle appeared one day in Arkham in quest of the dreaded volume 3
kept under lock and key at the college library - the hideous Necronomicon of the 3
mad Arab Abdul Alhazred in Olaus Wormius' Latin version, as printed in Spain 3
in the seventeenth century. He had never seen a city before, but had no thought 3
save to find his way to the university grounds; where indeed, he passed 3
heedlessly by the great white-fanged watchdog that barked with unnatural fury 3
and enmity, and tugged frantically at its stout chaim. 3
3
Wilbur had with him the priceless but imperfect copy of Dr Dee's English 3
version which his grandfather had bequeathed him, and upon receiving access to 3
the Latin copy he at once began to collate the two texts with the aim of 3
discovering a certain passage which would have come on the 751st page of his 3
own defective volume. This much he could not civilly refrain from telling the 3
librarian - the same erudite Henry Armitage (A.M. Miskatonic, Ph.D. Princeton, 3
Litt.D. Johns Hopkins) who had once called at the farm, and who now politely 3
plied him with questions. He was looking, he had to admit, for a kind of formula 3
or incantation containing the frightful name Yog-Sothoth, and it puzzled him to 3
find discrepancies, duplications, and ambiguities which made the matter of 3
determination far from easy. As he copied the formula he finally chose, Dr 3
3
3
3
529 3
3
3
3
Armitage looked involuntarily over his shoulder at the open pages; the left-hand 3
one of which, in the Latin version, contained such monstrous threats to the peace 3
and sanity of the world. 3
3
Nor is it to be thought (ran the text as Armitage mentally translated it) that man 3
is either the oldest or the last of earth's masters, or that the common bulk of life 3
and substance walks alone. The Old Ones were, the Old Ones are, and the Old 3
Ones shall be. Not in the spaces we know, but between them, they walk serene 3
and primal, undimensioned and to us unseen. Yog-Sothoth knows the gate. Yog- 3
Sothoth is the gate. Yog-Sothoth is the key and guardian of the gate. Past, 3
present, future, all are one in Yog-Sothoth. He knows where the Old Ones broke 3
through of old, and where They shall break through again. He knows where 3
They had trod earth's fields, and where They still tread them, and why no one 3
can behold Them as They tread. By Their smell can men sometimes know Them 3
near, but of Their semblance can no man know, saving only in the features of 3
those They have begotten on mankind; and of those are there many sorts, 3
differing in likeness from man's truest eidolon to that shape without sight or 3
substance which is Them. They walk unseen and foul in lonely places where the 3
Words have been spoken and the Rites howled through at their Seasons. The 3
wind gibbers with Their voices, and the earth mutters with Their consciousness. 3
They bend the forest and crush the city, yet may not forest or city behold the 3
hand that smites. Kadath in the cold waste hath known Them, and what man 3
knows Kadath? The ice desert of the South and the sunken isles of Ocean hold 3
stones whereon Their seal is engraver, but who bath seen the deep frozen city or 3
the sealed tower long garlanded with seaweed and barnacles? Great Cthulhu is 3
Their cousin, yet can he spy Them only dimly. la! Shub-Niggurath! As a foulness 3
shall ye know Them. Their hand is at your throats, yet ye see Them not; and 3
Their habitation is even one with your guarded threshold. Yog-Sothoth is the key 3
to the gate, whereby the spheres meet. Man rules now where They ruled once; 3
They shall soon rule where man rules now. After summer is winter, after winter 3
summer. They wait patient and potent, for here shall They reign again. 3
3
Dr. Annitage, associating what he was reading with what he had heard of 3
Dunwich and its brooding presences, and of Wilbur Whateley and his dim, 3
hideous aura that stretched from a dubious birth to a cloud of probable 3
matricide, felt a wave of fright as tangible as a draught of the tomb's cold 3
clamminess. The bent, goatish giant before him seemed like the spawn of another 3
planet or dimension; like something only partly of mankind, and linked to black 3
gulfs of essence and entity that stretch like titan phantasms beyond all spheres of 3
force and matter, space and time. Presently Wilbur raised his head and began 3
speaking in that strange, resonant fashion which hinted at sound-producing 3
organs unlike the run of mankind's. 3
3
3
3

3
3
3
'Mr Armitage/ he said, 'I calc'late I've got to take that book home. They's things 3
in it I've got to try under sarten conditions that I can't git here, en' it 'ud be a 3
mortal sin to let a red-tape rule hold me up. Let me take it along. Sir, an' I'll swar 3
they wun't nobody know the difference. I dun't need to tell ye I'll take good keer 3
of it. It wan't me that put this Dee copy in the shape it is. . .' 3
3
He stopped as he saw firm denial on the librarian's face, and his own goatish 3
features grew crafty. Armitage, half-ready to tell him he might make a copy of 3
what parts he needed, thought suddenly of the possible consequences and 3
checked himself. There was too much responsibility in giving such a being the 3
key to such blasphemous outer spheres. Whateley saw how things stood, and 3
tried to answer lightly. 3
3
'Wal, all right, ef ye feel that way abaout it. Maybe Harvard won't be so fussy as 3
yew be.' And without saying more he rose and strode out of the building, 3
stooping at each doorway. 3
3
Armitage heard the savage yelping of the great watchdog, and studied 3
Whateley's gorilla-like lope as he crossed the bit of campus visible from the 3
window. He thought of the wild tales he had heard, and recalled the old Sunday 3
stories in the Advertiser; these things, and the lore he had picked up from 3
Dunwich rustics and villagers during his one visit there. Unseen things not of 3
earth - or at least not of tridimensional earth - rushed foetid and horrible through 3
New England's glens, and brooded obscenely on the mountain tops. Of this he 3
had long felt certain. Now he seemed to sense the close presence of some terrible 3
part of the intruding horror, and to glimpse a hellish advance in the black 3
dominion of the ancient and once passive nightmare. He locked away the 3
Necronomicon with a shudder of disgust, but the room still reeked with an 3
unholy and unidentifiable stench. 'As a foulness shall ye know them,' he quoted. 3
Yes - the odour was the same as that which had sickened him at the Whateley 3
farmhouse less than three years before. He thought of Wilbur, goatish and 3
ominous, once again, and laughed mockingly at the village rumours of his 3
parentage. 3
3
'Inbreeding?' Armitage muttered half-aloud to himself. 'Great God, what 3
simpletons! Show them Arthur Machen's Great God Pan and they'll think it a 3
common Dunwich scandal! But what thing - what cursed shapeless influence on 3
or off this three-dimensional earth - was Wilbur Whateley's father? Born on 3
Candlemas - nine months after May Eve of 1912, when the talk about the queer 3
earth noises reached clear to Arkham - what walked on the mountains that May 3
night? What Roodmas horror fastened itself on the world in half-human flesh 3
and blood?' 3

During the ensuing weeks Dr Armitage set about to collect all possible data on 3
Wilbur Whateley and the formless presences around Dunwich. He got in 3
communication with Dr Houghton of Aylesbury, who had attended Old 3
Whateley in his last illness, and found much to ponder over in the grandfather's 3
last words as quoted by the physician. A visit to Dunwich Village failed to bring 3
out much that was new; but a close survey of the Necronomicon, in those parts 3
which Wilbur had sought so avidly, seemed to supply new and terrible clues to 3
the nature, methods, and desires of the strange evil so vaguely threatening this 3
planet. Talks with several students of archaic lore in Boston, and letters to many 3
others elsewhere, gave him a growing amazement which passed slowly through 3
varied degrees of alarm to a state of really acute spiritual fear. As the summer 3
drew on he felt dimly that something ought to be done about the lurking terrors 3
of the upper Miskatonic valley, and about the monstrous being known to the 3
human world as Wilbur Whateley. 3
3
VI. 3
3
The Dunwich horror itself came between Lammas and the equinox in 1928, and 3
Dr Armitage was among those who witnessed its monstrous prologue. He had 3
heard, meanwhile, of Whateley' s grotesque trip to Cambridge, and of his frantic 3
efforts to borrow or copy from the Necronomicon at the Widener Library. Those 3
efforts had been in vain, since Armitage had issued warnings of the keenest 3
intensity to all librarians having charge of the dreaded volume. Wilbur had been 3
shockingly nervous at Cambridge; anxious for the book, yet almost equally 3
anxious to get home again, as if he feared the results of being away long. 3
3
Early in August the half-expected outcome developed, and in the small hours of 3
the third Dr Armitage was awakened suddenly by the wild, fierce cries of the 3
savage watchdog on the college campus. Deep and terrible, the snarling, half- 3
mad growls and barks continued; always in mounting volume, but with 3
hideously significant pauses. Then there rang out a scream from a wholly 3
different throat - such a scream as roused half the sleepers of Arkham and 3
haunted their dreams ever afterwards - such a scream as could come from no 3
being born of earth, or wholly of earth. 3
3
Armitage, hastening into some clothing and rushing across the street and lawn to 3
the college buildings, saw that others were ahead of him; and heard the echoes of 3
a burglar-alarm still shrilling from the library. An open window showed black 3
and gaping in the moonlight. What had come had indeed completed its entrance; 3
for the barking and the screaming, now fast fading into a mixed low growling 3
and moaning, proceeded unmistakably from within. Some instinct warned 3
Armitage that what was taking place was not a thing for unfortified eyes to see, 3
so he brushed back the crowd with authority as he unlocked the vestibule door. 3
3
3
3
532 3
3
3
3
Among the others he saw Professor Warren Rice and Dr Francis Morgan, men to 3
whom he had told some of his conjectures and misgivings; and these two he 3
motioned to accompany him inside. The inward sounds, except for a watchful, 3
droning whine from the dog, had by this time quite subsided; but Armitage now 3
perceived with a sudden start that a loud chorus of whippoorwills among the 3
shrubbery had commenced a damnably rhythmical piping, as if in unison with 3
the last breaths of a dying man. 3
3
The building was full of a frightful stench which Dr Armitage knew too well, and 3
the three men rushed across the hall to the small genealogical reading-room 3
whence the low whining came. For a second nobody dared to turn on the light, 3
then Armitage summoned up his courage and snapped the switch. One of the 3
three - it is not certain which - shrieked aloud at what sprawled before them 3
among disordered tables and overturned chairs. Professor Rice declares that he 3
wholly lost consciousness for an instant, though he did not stumble or fall. 3
3
The thing that lay half-bent on its side in a foetid pool of greenish-yellow ichor 3
and tarry stickiness was almost nine feet tall, and the dog had torn off all the 3
clothing and some of the skin. It was not quite dead, but twitched silently and 3
spasmodically while its chest heaved in monstrous unison with the mad piping 3
of the expectant whippoorwills outside. Bits of shoe-leather and fragments of 3
apparel were scattered about the room, and just inside the window an empty 3
canvas sack lay where it had evidently been thrown. Near the central desk a 3
revolver had fallen, a dented but undischarged cartridge later explaining why it 3
had not been fired. The thing itself, however, crowded out all other images at the 3
time. It would be trite and not wholly accurate to say that no human pen could 3
describe it, but one may properly say that it could not be vividly visualized by 3
anyone whose ideas of aspect and contour are too closely bound up with the 3
common life-forms of this planet and of the three known dimensions. It was 3
partly human, beyond a doubt, with very manlike hands and head, and the 3
goatish, chinless face had the stamp of the Whateley's upon it. But the torso and 3
lower parts of the body were teratologically fabulous, so that only generous 3
clothing could ever have enabled it to walk on earth unchallenged or 3
uneradicated. 3
3
Above the waist it was semi-anthropomorphic; though its chest, where the dog's 3
rending paws still rested watchfully, had the leathery, reticulated hide of a 3
crocodile or alligator. The back was piebald with yellow and black, and dimly 3
suggested the squamous covering of certain snakes. Below the waist, though, it 3
was the worst; for here all human resemblance left off and sheer phantasy began. 3
The skin was thickly covered with coarse black fur, and from the abdomen a 3
score of long greenish-grey tentacles with red sucking mouths protruded limply. 3
3
3
3
533 3
3
3
3
Their arrangement was odd, and seemed to follow the symmetries of some 3
cosmic geometry unknown to earth or the solar system. On each of the hips, deep 3
set in a kind of pinkish, ciliated orbit, was what seemed to be a rudimentary eye; 3
whilst in lieu of a tail there depended a kind of trunk or feeler with purple 3
annular markings, and with many evidences of being an undeveloped mouth or 3
throat. The limbs, save for their black fur, roughly resembled the hind legs of 3
prehistoric earth's giant saurians, and terminated in ridgy-veined pads that were 3
neither hooves nor claws. When the thing breathed, its tail and tentacles 3
rhythmically changed colour, as if from some circulatory cause normal to the 3
non-human greenish tinge, whilst in the tail it was manifest as a yellowish 3
appearance which alternated with a sickly grayish-white in the spaces between 3
the purple rings. Of genuine blood there was none; only the foetid greenish- 3
yellow ichor which trickled along the painted floor beyond the radius of the 3
stickiness, and left a curious discoloration behind it. 3
3
As the presence of the three men seemed to rouse the dying thing, it began to 3
mumble without turning or raising its head. Dr Armitage made no written 3
record of its mouthings, but asserts confidently that nothing in English was 3
uttered. At first the syllables defied all correlation with any speech of earth, but 3
towards the last there came some disjointed fragments evidently taken from the 3
Necronomicon, that monstrous blasphemy in quest of which the thing had 3
perished. These fragments, as Armitage recalls them, ran something like 'N'gai, 3
n'gha'ghaa, bugg-shoggog, y'hah: Yog-Sothoth, Yog-Sothoth ...' They trailed off 3
into nothingness as the whippoorwills shrieked in rhythmical crescendos of 3
unholy anticipation. 3
3
Then came a halt in the gasping, and the dog raised its head in a long, lugubrious 3
howl. A change came over the yellow, goatish face of the prostrate thing, and the 3
great black eyes fell in appallingly. Outside the window the shrilling of the 3
whippoorwills had suddenly ceased, and above the murmurs of the gathering 3
crowd there came the sound of a panic-struck whirring and fluttering. Against 3
the moon vast clouds of feathery watchers rose and raced from sight, frantic at 3
that which they had sought for prey. 3
3
All at once the dog started up abruptly, gave a frightened bark, and leaped 3
nervously out of the window by which it had entered. A cry rose from the 3
crowd, and Dr Armitage shouted to the men outside that no one must be 3
admitted till the police or medical examiner came. He was thankful that the 3
windows were just too high to permit of peering in, and drew the dark curtains 3
carefully down over each one. By this time two policemen had arrived; and Dr 3
Morgan, meeting them in the vestibule, was urging them for their own sakes to 3
postpone entrance to the stench-filled reading-room till the examiner came and 3
the prostrate thing could be covered up. 3
3
3
3
534 3
3
3
3
Meanwhile frightful changes were taking place on the floor. One need not 3
describe the kind and rate of shrinkage and disintegration that occurred before 3
the eyes of Dr Armitage and Professor Rice; but it is permissible to say that, aside 3
from the external appearance of face and hands, the really human element in 3
Wilbur Whateley must have been very small. When the medical examiner came, 3
there was only a sticky whitish mass on the painted boards, and the monstrous 3
odour had nearly disappeared. Apparently Whateley had had no skull or bony 3
skeleton; at least, in any true or stable sense. He had taken somewhat after his 3
unknown father. 3
3
VII. 3
3
Yet all this was only the prologue of the actual Dunwich horror. Formalities were 3
gone through by bewildered officials, abnormal details were duly kept from 3
press and public, and men were sent to Dunwich and Aylesbury to look up 3
property and notify any who might be heirs of the late Wilbur Whateley. They 3
found the countryside in great agitation, both because of the growing rumblings 3
beneath the domed hills, and because of the unwonted stench and the surging, 3
lapping sounds which came increasingly from the great empty shell formed by 3
Whateley's boarded-up farmhouse. Earl Sawyer, who tended the horse and cattle 3
during Wilbur's absence, had developed a woefully acute case of nerves. The 3
officials devised excuses not to enter the noisome boarded place; and were glad 3
to confine their survey of the deceased's living quarters, the newly mended 3
sheds, to a single visit. They filed a ponderous report at the courthouse in 3
Aylesbury, and litigations concerning heirship are said to be still in progress 3
amongst the innumerable Whateleys, decayed and undecayed, of the upper 3
Miskatonic valley. 3
3
An almost interminable manuscript in strange characters, written in a huge 3
ledger and adjudged a sort of diary because of the spacing and the variations in 3
ink and penmanship, presented a baffling puzzle to those who found it on the 3
old bureau which served as its owner's desk. After a week of debate it was sent 3
to Miskatonic University, together with the deceased's collection of strange 3
books, for study and possible translation; but even the best linguists soon saw 3
that it was not likely to be unriddled with ease. No trace of the ancient gold with 3
which Wilbur and Old Whateley had always paid their debts has yet been 3
discovered. 3
3
It was in the dark of September ninth that the horror broke loose. The hill noises 3
had been very pronounced during the evening, and dogs barked frantically all 3
night. Early risers on the tenth noticed a peculiar stench in the air. About seven 3
o'clock Luther Brown, the hired boy at George Corey's, between Cold Spring 3
Glen and the village, rushed frenziedly back from his morning trip to Ten-Acre 3
3
3
3
535 3
3
3
3
Meadow with the cows. He was almost convulsed with fright as he stumbled 3
into the kitchen; and in the yard outside the no less frightened herd were pawing 3
and lowing pitifully, having followed the boy back in the panic they shared with 3
him. Between gasps Luther tried to stammer out his tale to Mrs Corey. 3
3
'Up thar in the rud beyont the glen. Mis' Corey - they's suthin' ben thar! It smells 3
like thunder, an' all the bushes an' little trees is pushed back from the rud like 3
they'd a haouse ben moved along of it. An' that ain't the wust, nuther. They's 3
prints in the rud. Mis' Corey - great raound prints as big as barrel-heads, all sunk 3
dawon deep like a elephant had ben along, only they's a sight more nor four feet 3
could make! I looked at one or two afore I run, an' I see every one was covered 3
with lines spreadin' aout from one place, like as if big palm-leaf fans - twict or 3
three times as big as any they is - hed of ben paounded dawon into the rud. An' 3
the smell was awful, like what it is around Wizard Whateley's ol' haouse. . .' 3
3
Here he faltered, and seemed to shiver afresh with the fright that had sent him 3
flying home. Mrs Corey, unable to extract more information, began telephoning 3
the neighbours; thus starting on its rounds the overture of panic that heralded 3
the major terrors. When she got Sally Sawyer, housekeeper at Seth Bishop's, the 3
nearest place to Whateley's, it became her turn to listen instead of transmit; for 3
Sally's boy Chauncey, who slept poorly, had been up on the hill towards 3
Whateley's, and had dashed back in terror after one look at the place, and at the 3
pasturage where Mr Bishop's cows had been left out all night. 3
3
'Yes, Mis' Corey,' came Sally's tremulous voice over the party wire, 'Cha'ncey he 3
just come back a-postin', and couldn't half talk fer bein' scairt! He says Ol' 3
Whateley's house is all bowed up, with timbers scattered raound like they'd ben 3
dynamite inside; only the bottom floor ain't through, but is all covered with a 3
kind o' tar-like stuff that smells awful an' drips daown offen the aidges onto the 3
graoun' whar the side timbers is blowed away. An' they's awful kinder marks in 3
the yard, tew - great raound marks bigger raound than a hogshead, an' all sticky 3
with stuff like is on the browed-up haouse. Cha'ncey he says they leads off into 3
the medders, whar a great swath wider'n a barn is matted daown, an' all the stun 3
walls tumbled every whichway wherever it goes. 3
3
'An' he says, says he. Mis' Corey, as haow he sot to look fer Seth's caows, 3
frightened ez he was an' faound 'em in the upper pasture nigh the Devil's Hop 3
Yard in an awful shape. Haff on 'em's clean gone, an' nigh haff o' them that's left 3
is sucked most dry o' blood, with sores on 'em like they's ben on Whateleys 3
cattle ever senct Lavinny's black brat was born. Seth hes gone aout naow to look 3
at 'em, though I'll vaow he won't keer ter git very nigh Wizard Whateley's! 3
Cha'ncey didn't look keerful ter see whar the big matted-daown swath led arter 3
3
3
3
536 3
3
3
3
it leff the pasturage, but he says he thinks it p'inted towards the glen rud to the 3
village. 3
3
'I tell ye. Mis' Corey, they's suthin' abroad as hadn't orter be abroad, an' I for one 3
think that black Wilbur Whateley, as come to the bad end he deserved, is at the 3
bottom of the breedin' of it. He wa'n't all human hisself, I alius says to 3
everybody; an' I think he an' OF Whateley must a raised suthin' in that there 3
nailed-up haouse as ain't even so human as he was. They's alius ben unseen 3
things araound Dunwich - livin' things - as ain't human an' ain't good fer human 3
folks. 3
3
'The graoun' was a-talkin' las' night, an' towards mornin' Cha'ncey he heered 3
the whippoorwills so laoud in Col' Spring Glen he couldn't sleep nun. Then he 3
thought he heered another faint-like saound over towards Wizard Whateley's - a 3
kinder rippin' or tearin' o' wood, like some big box er crate was bein' opened fur 3
off. What with this an' that, he didn't git to sleep at all till sunup, an' no sooner 3
was he up this mornin', but he's got to go over to Whateley's an' see what's the 3
matter. He see enough I tell ye. Mis' Corey! This dun't mean no good, an' I think 3
as all the men-folks ought to git up a party an' do suthin'. I know suthin' awful's 3
abaout, an' feel my time is nigh, though only Gawd knows jest what it is. 3
3
'Did your Luther take accaount o' whar them big tracks led tew? No? Wal, Mis' 3
Corey, ef they was on the glen rud this side o' the glen, an' ain't got to your 3
haouse yet, I calc'late they must go into the glen itself. They would do that. I 3
alius says Col' Spring Glen ain't no healthy nor decent place. The whippoorwills 3
an' fireflies there never did act like they was creaters o' Gawd, an' they's them as 3
says ye kin hear strange things a-rushin' an' a-talkin' in the air dawon thar ef ye 3
stand in the right place, atween the rock falls an' Bear's Den.' 3
3
By that noon fully three-quarters of the men and boys of Dunwich were trooping 3
over the roads and meadows between the newmade Whateley ruins and Cold 3
Spring Glen, examining in horror the vast, monstrous prints, the maimed Bishop 3
cattle, the strange, noisome wreck of the farmhouse, and the bruised, matted 3
vegetation of the fields and roadside. Whatever had burst loose upon the world 3
had assuredly gone down into the great sinister ravine; for all the trees on the 3
banks were bent and broken, and a great avenue had been gouged in the 3
precipice-hanging underbrush. It was as though a house, launched by an 3
avalanche, had slid down through the tangled growths of the almost vertical 3
slope. From below no sound came, but only a distant, undefinable foetor; and it 3
is not to be wondered at that the men preferred to stay on the edge and argue, 3
rather than descend and beard the unknown Cyclopean horror in its lair. Three 3
dogs that were with the party had barked furiously at first, but seemed cowed 3
and reluctant when near the glen. Someone telephoned the news to the 3
3
3
3
537 3
3
3
3
Aylesbury Transcript; but the editor, accustomed to wild tales from Dunwich, 3
did no more than concoct a humorous paragraph about it; an item soon 3
afterwards reproduced by the Associated Press. 3
3
That night everyone went home, and every house and barn was barricaded as 3
stoutly as possible. Needless to say, no cattle were allowed to remain in open 3
pasturage. About two in the morning a frightful stench and the savage barking of 3
the dogs awakened the household at Elmer Frye's, on the eastern edge of Cold 3
Spring Glen, and all agreed that they could hear a sort of muffled swishing or 3
lapping sound from somewhere outside. Mrs Frye proposed telephoning the 3
neighbours, and Elmer was about to agree when the noise of splintering wood 3
burst in upon their deliberations. It came, apparently, from the barn; and was 3
quickly followed by a hideous screaming and stamping amongst the cattle. The 3
dogs slavered and crouched close to the feet of the fear-numbed family. Frye lit a 3
lantern through force of habit, but knew it would be death to go out into that 3
black farmyard. The children and the women-folk whimpered, kept from 3
screaming by some obscure, vestigial instinct of defence which told them their 3
lives depended on silence. At last the noise of the cattle subsided to a pitiful 3
moaning, and a great snapping, crashing, and crackling ensued. The Fryes, 3
huddled together in the sitting-room, did not dare to move until the last echoes 3
died away far down in Cold Spring Glen. Then, amidst the dismal moans from 3
the stable and the daemoniac piping of the late whippoorwills in the glen, Selina 3
Frye tottered to the telephone and spread what news she could of the second 3
phase of the horror. 3
3
The next day all the countryside was in a panic; and cowed, uncommunicative 3
groups came and went where the fiendish thing had occurred. Two titan swaths 3
of destruction stretched from the glen to the Frye farmyard, monstrous prints 3
covered the bare patches of ground, and one side of the old red barn had 3
completely caved in. Of the cattle, only a quarter could be found and identified. 3
Some of these were in curious fragments, and all that survived had to be shot. 3
Earl Sawyer suggested that help be asked from Aylesbury or Arkham, but others 3
maintained it would be of no use. Old Zebulon Whateley, of a branch that 3
hovered about halfway between soundness and decadence, made darkly wild 3
suggestions about rites that ought to be practiced on the hill-tops. He came of a 3
line where tradition ran strong, and his memories of chantings in the great stone 3
circles were not altogether connected with Wilbur and his grandfather. 3
3
Darkness fell upon a stricken countryside too passive to organize for real 3
defence. In a few cases closely related families would band together and watch in 3
the gloom under one roof; but in general there was only a repetition of the 3
barricading of the night before, and a futile, ineffective gesture of loading 3
muskets and setting pitchforks handily about. Nothing, however, occurred 3
3
3
3
538 3
3
3
3
except some hill noises; and when the day came there were many who hoped 3
that the new horror had gone as swiftly as it had come. There were even bold 3
souls who proposed an offensive expedition down in the glen, though they did 3
not venture to set an actual example to the still reluctant majority. 3
3
When night came again the barricading was repeated, though there was less 3
huddling together of families. In the morning both the Frye and the Seth Bishop 3
households reported excitement among the dogs and vague sounds and stenches 3
from afar, while early explorers noted with horror a fresh set of the monstrous 3
tracks in the road skirting Sentinel Hill. As before, the sides of the road showed a 3
bruising indicative of the blasphemously stupendous bulk of the horror; whilst 3
the conformation of the tracks seemed to argue a passage in two directions, as if 3
the moving mountain had come from Cold Spring Glen and returned to it along 3
the same path. At the base of the hill a thirty-foot swath of crushed shrubbery 3
saplings led steeply upwards, and the seekers gasped when they saw that even 3
the most perpendicular places did not deflect the inexorable trail. Whatever the 3
horror was, it could scale a sheer stony cliff of almost complete verticality; and as 3
the investigators climbed round to the hill's summit by safer routes they saw that 3
the trail ended - or rather, reversed - there. 3
3
It was here that the Whateleys used to build their hellish fires and chant their 3
hellish rituals by the table-like stone on May Eve and Hallowmass. Now that 3
very stone formed the centre of a vast space thrashed around by the 3
mountainous horror, whilst upon its slightly concave surface was a thick and 3
foetid deposit of the same tarry stickiness observed on the floor of the ruined 3
Whateley farmhouse when the horror escaped. Men looked at one another and 3
muttered. Then they looked down the hill. Apparently the horror had descended 3
by a route much the same as that of its ascent. To speculate was futile. Reason, 3
logic, and normal ideas of motivation stood confounded. Only old Zebulon, who 3
was not with the group, could have done justice to the situation or suggested a 3
plausible explanation. 3
3
Thursday night began much like the others, but it ended less happily. The 3
whippoorwills in the glen had screamed with such unusual persistence that 3
many could not sleep, and about 3 A.M. all the party telephones rang 3
tremulously. Those who took down their receivers heard a fright-mad voice 3
shriek out, 'Help, oh, my Gawd! ...' and some thought a crashing sound 3
followed the breaking off of the exclamation. There was nothing more. No one 3
dared do anything, and no one knew till morning whence the call came. Then 3
those who had heard it called everyone on the line, and found that only the Fryes 3
did not reply. The truth appeared an hour later, when a hastily assembled group 3
of armed men trudged out to the Frye place at the head of the glen. It was 3
horrible, yet hardly a surprise. There were more swaths and monstrous prints. 3
3
3
3
539 3
3
3
3
but there was no longer any house. It had caved in Hke an egg-shell, and 3
amongst the ruins nothing living or dead could be discovered. Only a stench and 3
a tarry stickiness. The Elmer Fryes had been erased from Dunwich. 3
3
VIII. 3
3
In the meantime a quieter yet even more spiritually poignant phase of the horror 3
had been blackly unwinding itself behind the closed door of a shelf-lined room in 3
Arkham. The curious manuscript record or diary of Wilbur Whateley, delivered 3
to Miskatonic University for translation had caused much worry and bafflement 3
among the experts in language both ancient and modern; its very alphabet, 3
notwithstanding a general resemblance to the heavily-shaded Arabic used in 3
Mesopotamia, being absolutely unknown to any available authority. The final 3
conclusion of the linguists was that the text represented an artificial alphabet, 3
giving the effect of a cipher; though none of the usual methods of cryptographic 3
solution seemed to furnish any clue, even when applied on the basis of every 3
tongue the writer might conceivably have used. The ancient books taken from 3
Whateley's quarters, while absorbingly interesting and in several cases 3
promising to open up new and terrible lines of research among philosophers and 3
men of science, were of no assistance whatever in this matter. One of them, a 3
heavy tome with an iron clasp, was in another unknown alphabet - this one of a 3
very different cast, and resembling Sanskrit more than anything else. The old 3
ledger was at length given wholly into the charge of Dr Armitage, both because 3
of his peculiar interest in the Whateley matter, and because of his wide linguistic 3
learning and skill in the mystical formulae of antiquity and the middle ages. 3
3
Armitage had an idea that the alphabet might be something esoterically used by 3
certain forbidden cults which have come down from old times, and which have 3
inherited many forms and traditions from the wizards of the Saracenic world. 3
That question, however, he did not deem vital; since it would be unnecessary to 3
know the origin of the symbols if, as he suspected, they were used as a cipher in 3
a modern language. It was his belief that, considering the great amount of text 3
involved, the writer would scarcely have wished the trouble of using another 3
speech than his own, save perhaps in certain special formulae and incantations. 3
Accordingly he attacked the manuscript with the preliminary assumption that 3
the bulk of it was in English. 3
3
Dr Armitage knew, from the repeated failures of his colleagues, that the riddle 3
was a deep and complex one; and that no simple mode of solution could merit 3
even a trial. All through late August he fortified himself with the mass lore of 3
cryptography; drawing upon the fullest resources of his own library, and wading 3
night after night amidst the arcana of Trithemius' Poligraphia, Giambattista 3
Porta's De Furtivis Literarum Notis, De Vigenere's Traite des Chiffres, Falconer's 3

and such fairly modern authorities as Blair, van Marten and Kluber's script itself, 3
and in time became convinced that he had to deal with one of those subtlest and 3
most ingenious of cryptograms, in which many separate lists of corresponding 3
letters are arranged like the multiplication table, and the message built up with 3
arbitrary key-words known only to the initiated. The older authorities seemed 3
rather more helpful than the newer ones, and Armitage concluded that the code 3
of the manuscript was one of great antiquity, no doubt handed down through a 3
long line of mystical experimenters. Several times he seemed near daylight, only 3
to be set back by some unforeseen obstacle. Then, as September approached, the 3
clouds began to clear. Certain letters, as used in certain parts of the manuscript, 3
emerged definitely and unmistakably; and it became obvious that the text was 3
indeed in English. 3
3
On the evening of September second the last major barrier gave way, and Dr 3
Armitage read for the first time a continuous passage of Wilbur Whateley's 3
annals. It was in truth a diary, as all had thought; and it was couched in a style 3
clearly showing the mixed occult erudition and general illiteracy of the strange 3
being who wrote it. Almost the first long passage that Armitage deciphered, an 3
entry dated November 26, 1916, proved highly startling and disquieting. It was 3
written,he remembered, by a child of three and a half who looked like a lad of 3
twelve or thirteen. 3
3
Today learned the Aklo for the Sabaoth (it ran), which did not like, it being 3
answerable from the hill and not from the air. That upstairs more ahead of me 3
than I had thought it would be, and is not like to have much earth brain. Shot 3
Elam Hutchins's collie Jack when he went to bite me, and Elam says he would 3
kill me if he dast. I guess he won't. Grandfather kept me saying the Dho formula 3
last night, and I think I saw the inner city at the 2 magnetic poles. I shall go to 3
those poles when the earth is cleared off, if I can't break through with the Dho- 3
Hna formula when I commit it. They from the air told me at Sabbat that it will be 3
years before I can clear off the earth, and I guess grandfather will be dead then, 3
so I shall have to learn all the angles of the planes and all the formulas between 3
the Yr and the Nhhngr. They from outside will help, but they cannot take body 3
without human blood. That upstairs looks it will have the right cast. I can see it a 3
little when I make the Voorish sign or blow the powder of Ibn Ghazi at it, and it 3
is near like them at May Eve on the Hill. The other face may wear off some. I 3
wonder how I shall look when the earth is cleared and there are no earth beings 3
on it. He that came with the Aklo Sabaoth said I may be transfigured there being 3
much of outside to work on. 3
3
Morning found Dr Armitage in a cold sweat of terror and a frenzy of wakeful 3
concentration. He had not left the manuscript all night, but sat at his table under 3
3
3
3
541 3
3
3
3
the electric light turning page after page with shaking hands as fast as he could 3
decipher the cryptic text. He had nervously telephoned his wife he would not be 3
home, and when she brought him a breakfast from the house he could scarcely 3
dispose of a mouthful. All that day he read on, now and then halted 3
maddeningly as a reapplication of the complex key became necessary. Lunch and 3
dinner were brought him, but he ate only the smallest fraction of either. Toward 3
the middle of the next night he drowsed off in his chair, but soon woke out of a 3
tangle of nightmares almost as hideous as the truths and menaces to man's 3
existence that he had uncovered. 3
3
On the morning of September fourth Professor Rice and Dr Morgan insisted on 3
seeing him for a while, and departed trembling and ashen-grey. That evening he 3
went to bed, but slept only fitfully. Wednesday - the next day - he was back at 3
the manuscript, and began to take copious notes both from the current sections 3
and from those he had already deciphered. In the small hours of that night he 3
slept a little in a easy chair in his office, but was at the manuscript again before 3
dawn. Some time before noon his physician, Dr Hartwell, called to see him and 3
insisted that he cease work. He refused; intimating that it was of the most vital 3
importance for him to complete the reading of the diary and promising an 3
explanation in due course of time. That evening, just as twilight fell, he finished 3
his terrible perusal and sank back exhausted. His wife, bringing his dinner, 3
found him in a half-comatose state; but he was conscious enough to warn her off 3
with a sharp cry when he saw her eyes wander toward the notes he had taken. 3
Weakly rising, he gathered up the scribbled papers and sealed them all in a great 3
envelope, which he immediately placed in his inside coat pocket. He had 3
sufficient strength to get home, but was so clearly in need of medical aid that Dr 3
Hartwell was summoned at once. As the doctor put him to bed he could only 3
mutter over and over again, 'But what, in God's name, can we do?' 3
3
Dr Armitage slept, but was partly delirious the next day. He made no 3
explanations to Hartwell, but in his calmer moments spoke of the imperative 3
need of a long conference with Rice and Morgan. His wilder wanderings were 3
very startling indeed, including frantic appeals that something in a boarded-up 3
farmhouse be destroyed, and fantastic references to some plan for the extirpation 3
of the entire human race and all animal and vegetable life from the earth by some 3
terrible elder race of beings from another dimension. He would shout that the 3
world was in danger, since the Elder Things wished to strip it and drag it away 3
from the solar system and cosmos of matter into some other plane or phase of 3
entity from which it had once fallen, vigintillions of aeons ago. At other times he 3
would call for the dreaded Necronomicon and the Daemonolatreia of Remigius, 3
in which he seemed hopeful of finding some formula to check the peril he 3
conjured up. 3
3
3
3
542 3
3
3
3
'Stop them, stop theml' he would shout. 'Those Whateleys meant to let them in, 3
and the worst of all is left! Tell Rice and Morgan we must do something - it's a 3
blind business, but I know how to make the powder... It hasn't been fed since 3
the second of August, when Wilbur came here to his death, and at that rate. . .' 3
3
But Armitage had a sound physique despite his seventy-three years, and slept off 3
his disorder that night without developing any real fever. He woke late Friday, 3
clear of head, though sober with a gnawing fear and tremendous sense of 3
responsibility. Saturday afternoon he felt able to go over to the library and 3
summon Rice and Morgan for a conference, and the rest of that day and evening 3
the three men tortured their brains in the wildest speculation and the most 3
desperate debate. Strange and terrible books were drawn voluminously from the 3
stack shelves and from secure places of storage; and diagrams and formulae 3
were copied with feverish haste and in bewildering abundance. Of scepticism 3
there was none. All three had seen the body of Wilbur Whateley as it lay on the 3
floor in a room of that very building, and after that not one of them could feel 3
even slightly inclined to treat the diary as a madman's raving. 3
3
Opinions were divided as to notifying the Massachusetts State Police, and the 3
negative finally won. There were things involved which simply could not be 3
believed by those who had not seen a sample, as indeed was made clear during 3
certain subsequent investigations. Late at night the conference disbanded 3
without having developed a definite plan, but all day Sunday Armitage was 3
busy comparing formulae and mixing chemicals obtained from the college 3
laboratory. The more he reflected on the hellish diary, the more he was inclined 3
to doubt the efficacy of any material agent in stamping out the entity which 3
Wilbur Whateley had left behind him - the earth threatening entity which, 3
unknown to him, was to burst forth in a few hours and become the memorable 3
Dunwich horror. 3
3
Monday was a repetition of Sunday with Dr Armitage, for the task in hand 3
required an infinity of research and experiment. Further consultations of the 3
monstrous diary brought about various changes of plan, and he knew that even 3
in the end a large amount of uncertainty must remain. By Tuesday he had a 3
definite line of action mapped out, and believed he would try a trip to Dunwich 3
within a week. Then, on Wednesday, the great shock came. Tucked obscurely 3
away in a corner of the Arkham Advertiser was a facetious little item from the 3
Associated Press, telling what a record-breaking monster the bootleg whisky of 3
Dunwich had raised up. Armitage, half stunned, could only telephone for Rice 3
and Morgan. Far into the night they discussed, and the next day was a 3
whirlwind of preparation on the part of them all. Armitage knew he would be 3
meddling with terrible powers, yet saw that there was no other way to annul the 3
deeper and more malign meddling which others had done before him. 3

IX. 3
3
Friday morning Armitage, Rice, and Morgan set out by motor for Dunwich, 3
arriving at the village about one in the afternoon. The day was pleasant, but even 3
in the brightest sunlight a kind of quiet dread and portent seemed to hover about 3
the strangely domed hills and the deep, shadowy ravines of the stricken region. 3
Now and then on some mountain top a gaunt circle of stones could be glimpsed 3
against the sky. From the air of hushed fright at Osborn's store they knew 3
something hideous had happened, and soon learned of the annihilation of the 3
Elmer Frye house and family. Throughout that afternoon they rode around 3
Dunwich, questioning the natives concerning all that had occurred, and seeing 3
for themselves with rising pangs of horror the drear Frye ruins with their 3
lingering traces of the tarry stickiness, the blasphemous tracks in the Frye yard, 3
the wounded Seth Bishop cattle, and the enormous swaths of disturbed 3
vegetation in various places. The trail up and down Sentinel Hill seemed to 3
Armitage of almost cataclysmic significance, and he looked long at the sinister 3
altar-like stone on the summit. 3
3
At length the visitors, apprised of a party of State Police which had come from 3
Aylesbury that morning in response to the first telephone reports of the Frye 3
tragedy, decided to seek out the officers and compare notes as far as practicable. 3
This, however, they found more easily planned than performed; since no sign of 3
the party could be found in any direction. There had been five of them in a car, 3
but now the car stood empty near the ruins in the Frye yard. The natives, all of 3
whom had talked with the policemen, seemed at first as perplexed as Armitage 3
and his companions. Then old Sam Hutchins thought of something and turned 3
pale, nudging Fred Farr and pointing to the dank, deep hollow that yawned 3
close by. 3
3
'Gawd,' he gasped, 'I felled 'em not ter go daown into the glen, an' I never 3
thought nobody'd dew it with them tracks an' that smell an' the whippoorwills 3
a-screechin' daown thar in the dark o' noonday. . .' 3
3
A cold shudder ran through natives and visitors alike, and every ear seemed 3
strained in a kind of instinctive, unconscious listening. Armitage, now that he 3
had actually come upon the horror and its monstrous work, trembled with the 3
responsibility he felt to be his. Night would soon fall, and it was then that the 3
mountainous blasphemy lumbered upon its eldritch course. Negotium 3
perambuians in tenebris... The old librarian rehearsed the formulae he had 3
memorized, and clutched the paper containing the alternative one he had not 3
memorized. He saw that his electric flashlight was in working order. Rice, beside 3
him, took from a valise a metal sprayer of the sort used in combating insects; 3
3
3
3
544 3
3
3
3
whilst Morgan uncased the big-game rifle on which he reHed despite his 3
colleague's warnings that no material weapon would be of help. 3
3
Armitage, having read the hideous diary, knew painfully well what kind of a 3
manifestation to expect; but he did not add to the fright of the Dunwich people 3
by giving any hints or clues. He hoped that it might be conquered without any 3
revelation to the world of the monstrous thing it had escaped. As the shadows 3
gathered, the natives commenced to disperse homeward, anxious to bar 3
themselves indoors despite the present evidence that all human locks and bolts 3
were useless before a force that could bend trees and crush houses when it chose. 3
They shook their heads at the visitors' plan to stand guard at the Frye ruins near 3
the glen; and, as they left, had little expectancy of ever seeing the watchers again. 3
3
There were rumblings under the hills that night, and the whippoorwills piped 3
threateningly. Once in a while a wind, sweeping up out of Cold Spring Glen, 3
would bring a touch of ineffable foetor to the heavy night air; such a foetor as all 3
three of the watchers had smelled once before, when they stood above a dying 3
thing that had passed for fifteen years and a half as a human being. But the 3
looked-for terror did not appear. Whatever was down there in the glen was 3
biding its time, and Armitage told his colleagues it would be suicidal to try to 3
attack it in the dark. 3
3
Morning came wanly, and the night-sounds ceased. It was a grey, bleak day, 3
with now and then a drizzle of rain; and heavier and heavier clouds seemed to 3
be piling themselves up beyond the hills to the north-west. The men from 3
Arkham were undecided what to do. Seeking shelter from the increasing rainfall 3
beneath one of the few undestroyed Frye outbuildings, they debated the wisdom 3
of waiting, or of taking the aggressive and going down into the glen in quest of 3
their nameless, monstrous quarry. The downpour waxed in heaviness, and 3
distant peals of thunder sounded from far horizons. Sheet lightning shimmered, 3
and then a forky bolt flashed near at hand, as if descending into the accursed 3
glen itself. The sky grew very dark, and the watchers hoped that the storm 3
would prove a short, sharp one followed by clear weather. 3
3
It was still gruesomely dark when, not much over an hour later, a confused babel 3
of voices sounded down the road. Another moment brought to view a frightened 3
group of more than a dozen men, running, shouting, and even whimpering 3
hysterically. Someone in the lead began sobbing out words, and the Arkham men 3
started violently when those words developed a coherent form. 3
3
'Oh, my Gawd, my Gawd,' the voice choked out. 'It's a-goin' agin, an' this time 3
by day! It's aout - it's aout an' a-movin' this very minute, an' only the Lord 3
knows when it'll be on us all!' 3
3
3
3
545 3
3
3
3
The speaker panted into silence, but another took up his message. 3
3
'Nigh on a haour ago Zeb Whateley here heered the 'phone a-ringin', an' it was 3
Mis' Corey, George's wife, that hves daown by the junction. She says the hired 3
boy Luther was aout drivin' in the caows from the storm arter the big boh, when 3
he see all the trees a-bendin' at the maouth o' the glen - opposite side ter this - an' 3
smelt the same awful smell like he smelt when he faound the big tracks las' 3
Monday mornin'. An' she says he says they was a swishin' lappin' saound, more 3
nor what the bendin' trees an' bushes could make, an' all on a suddent the trees 3
along the rud begun ter git pushed one side, an' they was a awful stompin' an' 3
splashin' in the mud. But mind ye, Luther he didn't see nothin' at all, only just 3
the bendin' trees an' underbrush. 3
3
'Then fur ahead where Bishop's Brook goes under the rud he heerd a awful 3
creakin' an' strainin' on the bridge, an' says he could tell the saound o' wood a- 3
startin' to crack an' split. An' all the whiles he never see a thing, only them trees 3
an' bushes a-bendin'. An' when the swishin' saound got very fur off - on the rud 3
towards Wizard Whateley's an' Sentinel Hill - Luther he had the guts ter step up 3
whar he'd heerd it fust an' look at the graound. It was all mud an' water, an' the 3
sky was dark, an' the rain was wipin' aout all tracks abaout as fast as could be; 3
but beginnin' at the glen maouth, whar the trees hed moved, they was still some 3
o' them awful prints big as bar'ls like he seen Monday.' 3
3
At this point the first excited speaker interrupted. 3
3
'But that ain't the trouble naow - that was only the start. Zeb here was callin' 3
folks up an' everybody was a-listenin' in when a call from Seth Bishop's cut in. 3
His haousekeeper Sally was carryin' on fit to kill - she'd jest seed the trees a- 3
bendin' beside the rud, an' says they was a kind o' mushy saound, like a 3
elephant puffin' an' treadin', a-headin' fer the haouse. Then she up an' spoke 3
suddent of a fearful smell, an' says her boy Cha'ncey was a-screamin' as haow it 3
was jest like what he smelt up to the Whateley rewins Monday mornin'. An' the 3
dogs was barkin' an' whinin' awful. 3
3
'An' then she let aout a turrible yell, an' says the shed daown the rud had jest 3
caved in like the storm bed blowed it over, only the wind w'an't strong enough 3
to dew that. Everybody was a-listenin', an' we could hear lots o' folks on the wire 3
a-gaspin'. All to onct Sally she yelled again, an' says the front yard picket fence 3
hed just crumbled up, though they wa'n't no sign o' what done it. Then 3
everybody on the line could hear Cha'ncey an' old Seth Bishop a-yellin' tew, an' 3
Sally was shriekin' aout that suthin' heavy hed struck the haouse - not lightnin' 3
nor nothin', but suthin' heavy again' the front, that kep' a-launchin' itself agin 3
3
3
3
546 3
3
3
3
an' agin, though ye couldn't see nothin' aout the front winders. An' then... an' 3
then...' 3
3
Lines of fright deepened on every face; and Armitage, shaken as he was, had 3
barely poise enough to prompt the speaker. 3
3
'An' then.... Sally she yelled aout, "O help, the haouse is a-cavin' in... an' on the 3
wire we could hear a turrible crashin' an' a hull flock o' screaming... jes like 3
when Elmer Frye's place was took, only wuss. . .' 3
3
The man paused, and another of the crowd spoke. 3
3
'That's all - not a saound nor squeak over the 'phone arter that. Jest still-like. We 3
that heerd it got aout Fords an' wagons an' rounded up as many able-bodied 3
men-folks as we could git, at Corey's place, an' come up here ter see what yew 3
thought best ter dew. Not but what I think it's the Lord's jedgment fer our 3
iniquities, that no mortal kin ever set aside.' 3
3
Armitage saw that the time for positive action had come, and spoke decisively to 3
the faltering group of frightened rustics. 3
3
'We must follow it, boys.' He made his voice as reassuring as possible. 'I believe 3
there's a chance of putting it out of business. You men know that those 3
Whateleys were wizards - well, this thing is a thing of wizardry, and must be put 3
down by the same means. I've seen Wilbur Whateley's diary and read some of 3
the strange old books he used to read; and I think I know the right kind of spell 3
to recite to make the thing fade away. Of course, one can't be sure, but we can 3
always take a chance. It's invisible - 1 knew it would be - but there's powder in 3
this long-distance sprayer that might make it show up for a second. Later on 3
we'll try it. It's a frightful thing to have alive, but it isn't as bad as what Wilbur 3
would have let in if he'd lived longer. You'll never know what the world 3
escaped. Now we've only this one thing to fight, and it can't multiply. It can, 3
though, do a lot of harm; so we mustn't hesitate to rid the community of it. 3
3
'We must follow it - and the way to begin is to go to the place that has just been 3
wrecked. Let somebody lead the way - I don't know your roads very well, but 3
I've an idea there might be a shorter cut across lots. How about it?' 3
3
The men shuffled about a moment, and then Earl Sawyer spoke softly, pointing 3
with a grimy finger through the steadily lessening rain. 3
3
'I guess ye kin git to Seth Bishop's quickest by cuttin' across the lower medder 3
here, wadin' the brook at the low place, an' climbin' through Carrier's mowin' 3
3
3
3
547 3
3
3
3
an' the timber-lot beyont. That comes aout on the upper rud mighty nigh Seth's - 3
a leetle t'other side.' 3
3
Armitage, with Rice and Morgan, started to walk in the direction indicated; and 3
most of the natives followed slowly. The sky was growing lighter, and there 3
were signs that the storm had worn itself away. When Armitage inadvertently 3
took a wrong direction, Joe Osborn warned him and walked ahead to show the 3
right one. Courage and confidence were mounting, though the twilight of the 3
almost perpendicular wooded hill which lay towards the end of their short cut, 3
and among whose fantastic ancient trees they had to scramble as if up a ladder, 3
put these qualities to a severe test. 3
3
At length they emerged on a muddy road to find the sun coming out. They were 3
a little beyond the Seth Bishop place, but bent trees and hideously unmistakable 3
tracks showed what had passed by. Only a few moments were consumed in 3
surveying the ruins just round the bend. It was the Frye incident all over again, 3
and nothing dead or living was found in either of the collapsed shells which had 3
been the Bishop house and barn. No one cared to remain there amidst the stench 3
and tarry stickiness, but all turned instinctively to the line of horrible prints 3
leading on towards the wrecked Whateley farmhouse and the altar-crowned 3
slopes of Sentinel Hill. 3
3
As the men passed the site of Wilbur Whateley's abode they shuddered visibly, 3
and seemed again to mix hesitancy with their zeal. It was no joke tracking down 3
something as big as a house that one could not see, but that had all the vicious 3
malevolence of a daemon. Opposite the base of Sentinel Hill the tracks left the 3
road, and there was a fresh bending and matting visible along the broad swath 3
marking the monster's former route to and from the summit. 3
3
Armitage produced a pocket telescope of considerable power and scanned the 3
steep green side of the hill. Then he handed the instrument to Morgan, whose 3
sight was keener. After a moment of gazing Morgan cried out sharply, passing 3
the glass to Earl Sawyer and indicating a certain spot on the slope with his finger. 3
Sawyer, as clumsy as most non-users of optical devices are, fumbled a while; but 3
eventually focused the lenses with Armitage's aid. When he did so his cry was 3
less restrained than Morgan's had been. 3
3
'Gawd almighty, the grass an' bushes is a'movin'! It's a-goin' up - slow-like - 3
creepin' - up ter the top this minute, heaven only knows what fur!' 3
3
Then the germ of panic seemed to spread among the seekers. It was one thing to 3
chase the nameless entity, but quite another to find it. Spells might be all right - 3
but suppose they weren't? Voices began questioning Armitage about what he 3
3
3
3
548 3
3
3
3
knew of the thing, and no reply seemed quite to satisfy. Everyone seemed to feel 3
himself in close proximity to phases of Nature and of being utterly forbidden and 3
wholly outside the sane experience of mankind. 3
3
X. 3
3
In the end the three men from Arkham - old, white-bearded Dr Armitage, stocky, 3
iron-grey Professor Rice, and lean, youngish Dr Morgan, ascended the mountain 3
alone. After much patient instruction regarding its focusing and use, they left the 3
telescope with the frightened group that remained in the road; and as they 3
climbed they were watched closely by those among whom the glass was passed 3
round. It was hard going, and Armitage had to be helped more than once. High 3
above the toiling group the great swath trembled as its hellish maker repassed 3
with snail-like deliberateness. Then it was obvious that the pursuers were 3
gaining. 3
3
Curtis Whateley - of the undecayed branch - was holding the telescope when the 3
Arkham party detoured radically from the swath. He told the crowd that the 3
men were evidently trying to get to a subordinate peak which overlooked the 3
swath at a point considerably ahead of where the shrubbery was now bending. 3
This, indeed, proved to be true; and the party were seen to gain the minor 3
elevation only a short time after the invisible blasphemy had passed it. 3
3
Then Wesley Corey, who had taken the glass, cried out that Armitage was 3
adjusting the sprayer which Rice held, and that something must be about to 3
happen. The crowd stirred uneasily, recalling that his sprayer was expected to 3
give the unseen horror a moment of visibility. Two or three men shut their eyes, 3
but Curtis Whateley snatched back the telescope and strained his vision to the 3
utmost. He saw that Rice, from the party's point of advantage above and behind 3
the entity, had an excellent chance of spreading the potent powder with 3
marvellous effect. 3
3
Those without the telescope saw only an instant's flash of grey cloud - a cloud 3
about the size of a moderately large building - near the top of the mountain. 3
Curtis, who held the instrument, dropped it with a piercing shriek into the ankle- 3
deep mud of the road. He reeled, and would have crumbled to the ground had 3
not two or three others seized and steadied him. All he could do was moan half- 3
inaudibly. 3
3
'Oh, oh, great Gawd. . . that. . . that. . .' 3
3
3
3
549 3
3
3
3
There was a pandemonium of questioning, and only Henry Wheeler thought to 3
rescue the fallen telescope and wipe it clean of mud. Curtis was past all 3
coherence, and even isolated replies were almost too much for him. 3
3
'Bigger'n a barn... all made o' squirmin' ropes... hull thing sort o' shaped like a 3
hen's egg bigger'n anything with dozens o' legs like hogs-heads that haff shut up 3
when they step... nothin' solid abaout it - all like jelly, an' made o' sep'rit 3
wrigglin' ropes pushed clost together... great bulgin' eyes all over it... ten or 3
twenty maouths or trunks a-stickin' aout all along the sides, big as stove-pipes an 3
all a-tossin' an openin' an' shuttin'... all grey, with kinder blue or purple rings... 3
an' Gawd it Heaven - that haff face on top. . .' 3
3
This final memory, whatever it was, proved too much for poor Curtis; and he 3
collapsed completely before he could say more. Fred Farr and Will Hutchins 3
carried him to the roadside and laid him on the damp grass. Henry Wheeler, 3
trembling, turned the rescued telescope on the mountain to see what he might. 3
Through the lenses were discernible three tiny figures, apparently running 3
towards the summit as fast as the steep incline allowed. Only these - nothing 3
more. Then everyone noticed a strangely unseasonable noise in the deep valley 3
behind, and even in the underbrush of Sentinel Hill itself. It was the piping of 3
unnumbered whippoorwills, and in their shrill chorus there seemed to lurk a 3
note of tense and evil expectancy. 3
3
Earl Sawyer now took the telescope and reported the three figures as standing on 3
the topmost ridge, virtually level with the altar-stone but at a considerable 3
distance from it. One figure, he said, seemed to be raising its hands above its 3
head at rhythmic intervals; and as Sawyer mentioned the circumstance the 3
crowd seemed to hear a faint, half-musical sound from the distance, as if a loud 3
chant were accompanying the gestures. The weird silhouette on that remote peak 3
must have been a spectacle of infinite grotesqueness and impressiveness, but no 3
observer was in a mood for aesthetic appreciation. 'I guess he's sayin' the spell,' 3
whispered Wheeler as he snatched back the telescope. The whippoorwills were 3
piping wildly, and in a singularly curious irregular rhythm quite unlike that of 3
the visible ritual. 3
3
Suddenly the sunshine seemed to lessen without the intervention of any 3
discernible cloud. It was a very peculiar phenomenon, and was plainly marked 3
by all. A rumbling sound seemed brewing beneath the hills, mixed strangely 3
with a concordant rumbling which clearly came from the sky. Lightning flashed 3
aloft, and the wondering crowd looked in vain for the portents of storm. The 3
chanting of the men from Arkham now became unmistakable, and Wheeler saw 3
through the glass that they were all raising their arms in the rhythmic 3
incantation. From some farmhouse far away came the frantic barking of dogs. 3

3
The change in the quahty of the dayhght increased, and the crowd gazed about 3
the horizon in wonder. A purpHsh darkness, born of nothing more than a 3
spectral deepening of the sky's blue, pressed down upon the rumbling hills. 3
Then the lightning flashed again, somewhat brighter than before, and the crowd 3
fancied that it had showed a certain mistiness around the altar-stone on the 3
distant height. No one, however, had been using the telescope at that instant. The 3
whippoorwills continued their irregular pulsation, and the men of Dunwich 3
braced themselves tensely against some imponderable menace with which the 3
atmosphere seemed surcharged. 3
3
Without warning came those deep, cracked, raucous vocal sounds which will 3
never leave the memory of the stricken group who heard them. Not from any 3
human throat were they born, for the organs of man can yield no such acoustic 3
perversions. Rather would one have said they came from the pit itself, had not 3
their source been so unmistakably the altar-stone on the peak. It is almost 3
erroneous to call them sounds at all, since so much of their ghastly, infra-bass 3
timbre spoke to dim seats of consciousness and terror far subtler than the ear; yet 3
one must do so, since their form was indisputably though vaguely that of half- 3
articulate words. They were loud - loud as the rumblings and the thunder above 3
which they echoed - yet did they come from no visible being. And because 3
imagination might suggest a conjectural source in the world of non-visible 3
beings, the huddled crowd at the mountain's base huddled still closer, and 3
winced as if in expectation of a blow. 3
3
'Ygnailh... ygnaiih... thflthkh'ngha.... Yog-Sothoth ...' rang the hideous 3
croaking out of space. 'Y'bthnk. . . h'ehye - n'grkdl'lh. . .' 3
3
The speaking impulse seemed to falter here, as if some frightful psychic struggle 3
were going on. Henry Wheeler strained his eye at the telescope, but saw only the 3
three grotesquely silhouetted human figures on the peak, all moving their arms 3
furiously in strange gestures as their incantation drew near its culmination. From 3
what black wells of Acherontic fear or feeling, from what unplumbed gulfs of 3
extra-cosmic consciousness or obscure, long-latent heredity, were those half- 3
articulate thunder-croakings drawn? Presently they began to gather renewed 3
force and coherence as they grew in stark, utter, ultimate frenzy. 3
3
'Eh-y-ya-ya-yahaah - e'yayayaaaa... ngh'aaaaa... ngh'aaa... h'yuh... h'yuh... 3
HELP! HELP! . . .ff - ff - ff - FATHER! FATHER! YOG-SOTHOTH!. . .' 3
3
But that was all. The pallid group in the road, still reeling at the indisputably 3
English syllables that had poured thickly and thunderously down from the 3
frantic vacancy beside that shocking altar-stone, were never to hear such 3
syllables again. Instead, they jumped violently at the terrific report which 3
3
3
3
551 3
3
3
3
seemed to rend the hills; the deafening, cataclysmic peal whose source, be it 3
inner earth or sky, no hearer was ever able to place. A single lightning bolt shot 3
from the purple zenith to the altar-stone, and a great tidal wave of viewless force 3
and indescribable stench swept down from the hill to all the countryside. Trees, 3
grass, and under-brush were whipped into a fury; and the frightened crowd at 3
the mountain's base, weakened by the lethal foetor that seemed about to 3
asphyxiate them, were almost hurled off their feet. Dogs howled from the 3
distance, green grass and foliage wilted to a curious, sickly yellow-grey, and over 3
field and forest were scattered the bodies of dead whippoorwills. 3
3
The stench left quickly, but the vegetation never came right again. To this day 3
there is something queer and unholy about the growths on and around that 3
fearsome hill Curtis Whateley was only just regaining consciousness when the 3
Arkham men came slowly down the mountain in the beams of a sunlight once 3
more brilliant and untainted. They were grave and quiet, and seemed shaken by 3
memories and reflections even more terrible than those which had reduced the 3
group of natives to a state of cowed quivering. In reply to a jumble of questions 3
they only shook their heads and reaffirmed one vital fact. 3
3
'The thing has gone for ever,' Armitage said. 'It has been split up into what it 3
was originally made of, and can never exist again. It was an impossibility in a 3
normal world. Only the least fraction was really matter in any sense we know. It 3
was like its father - and most of it has gone back to him in some vague realm or 3
dimension outside our material universe; some vague abyss out of which only 3
the most accursed rites of human blasphemy could ever have called him for a 3
moment on the hills.' 3
3
There was a brief silence, and in that pause the scattered senses of poor Curtis 3
Whateley began to knit back into a sort of continuity; so that he put his hands to 3
his head with a moan. Memory seemed to pick itself up where it had left off, and 3
the horror of the sight that had prostrated him burst in upon him again. 3
3
'Oh, oh, my Gawd, that haff face - that haff face on top of it... that face with the 3
red eyes an' crinkly albino hair, an' no chin, like the Whateley s... It was a 3
octopus, centipede, spider kind o' thing, but they was a haff-shaped man's face 3
on top of it, an' it looked like Wizard Whateley's, only it was yards an' yards 3
acrost....' 3
3
He paused exhausted, as the whole group of natives stared in a bewilderment 3
not quite crystallized into fresh terror. Only old Zebulon Whateley, who 3
wanderingly remembered ancient things but who had been silent heretofore, 3
spoke aloud. 3
3
3
3
552 3
3
3
3
'Fifteen year' gone/ he rambled, 'I heered OY Whateley say as haow some day 3
we'd hear a child o' Lavinny's a-callin' its father's name on the top o' Sentinel 3
Hill...' 3
3
But Joe Osborn interrupted him to question the Arkham men anew. 3
3
'What was it, anyhaow, an' haowever did young Wizard Whateley call it aout o' 3
the air it come from?' 3
3
Armitage chose his words very carefully. 3
3
'It was - well, it was mostly a kind of force that doesn't belong in our part of 3
space; a kind of force that acts and grows and shapes itself by other laws than 3
those of our sort of Nature. We have no business calling in such things from 3
outside, and only very wicked people and very wicked cults ever try to. There 3
was some of it in Wilbur Whateley himself - enough to make a devil and a 3
precocious monster of him, and to make his passing out a pretty terrible sight. 3
I'm going to burn his accursed diary, and if you men are wise you'll dynamite 3
that altar-stone up there, and pull down all the rings of standing stones on the 3
other hills. Things like that brought down the beings those Whateley s were so 3
fond of - the beings they were going to let in tangibly to wipe out the human race 3
and drag the earth off to some nameless place for some nameless purpose. 3
3
'But as to this thing we've just sent back - the Whateley s raised it for a terrible 3
part in the doings that were to come. It grew fast and big from the same reason 3
that Wilbur grew fast and big - but it beat him because it had a greater share of 3
the outsideness in it. You needn't ask how Wilbur called it out of the air. He 3
didn't call it out. It was his twin brother, but it looked more like the father than 3
he did.' 3

The Evil Clergyman 3
3
Written in 1937 3
3
Published in April of 1939 in Weird Tales 3
3
I was shown into the attic chamber by a grave, intelligent-looking man with quiet 3
clothes and an iron-gray beard, who spoke to me in this fashion: 3
3
"Yes, he lived here- but I don't advise your doing anything. Your curiosity 3
makes you irresponsible. We never come here at night, and it's only because of 3
his will that we keep it this way. You know what he did. That abominable society 3
took charge at last, and we don't know where he is buried. There was no way the 3
law or anything else could reach the society. 3
3
"I hope you won't stay till after dark. And I beg of you to let that thing on the 3
table- the thing that looks like a match-box- alone. We don't know what it is, but 3
we suspect it has something to do with what he did. We even avoid looking at it 3
very steadily." 3
3
After a time the man left me alone in the attic room. It was very dingy and dusty, 3
and only primitively furnished, but it had a neatness which showed it was not a 3
slum-denizen's quarters. There were shelves full of theological and classical 3
books, and another bookcase containing treatises on magic- Paracelsus, Albertus 3
Magnus, Trithemius, Hermes Trismegistus, Borellus, and others in a strange 3
alphabet whose titles I could not decipher. The furniture was very plain. There 3
was a door, but it led only into a closet. The only egress was the aperture in the 3
floor up to which the crude, steep staircase led. The windows were of bull's-eye 3
pattern, and the black oak beams bespoke unbelievable antiquity. Plainly, this 3
house was of the Old World. I seemed to know where I was, but cannot recall 3
what I then knew. Certainly the town was not London. My impression is of a 3
small seaport. 3
3
The small object on the table fascinated me intensely. I seemed to know what to 3
do with it, for I drew a pocket electric light- or what looked like one- out of my 3
pocket and nervously tested its flashes. The light was not white but violet, and 3
seemed less like true light than like some radioactive bombardment. I recall that I 3
did not regard it as a common flashlight- indeed, I had a common flashlight in 3
another pocket. 3
3
It was getting dark, and the ancient roofs and chimney-pots outside looked very 3
queer through the bull's-eye window-panes. Finally I summoned up courage and 3
propped the small object up on the table against a book- then turned the rays of 3
3
3
3
554 3
3
3
3
the peculiar violet light upon it. The light seemed now to be more like a rain of 3
hail or small violet particles than like a continuous beam. As the particles struck 3
the glassy surface at the center of the strange device, they seemed to produce a 3
crackling noise like the sputtering of a vacuum tube through which sparks are 3
passed. The dark glassy surface displayed a pinkish glow, and a vague white 3
shape seemed to be taking form at its center. Then I noticed that I was not alone 3
in the room- and put the ray-projector back in my pocket. 3
3
But the newcomer did not speak- nor did I hear any sound whatever during all 3
the immediately following moments. Everything was shadowy pantomime, as if 3
seen at a vast distance through some intervening haze- although on the other 3
hand the newcomer and all subsequent comers loomed large and close, as if both 3
near and distant, according to some abnormal geometry. 3
3
The newcomer was a thin, dark man of medium height attired in the clerical garb 3
of the Anglican church. He was apparently about thirty years old, with a sallow, 3
olive complexion and fairly good features, but an abnormally high forehead. His 3
black hair was well cut and neatly brushed, and he was clean-shaven though 3
blue-chinned with a heavy growth of beard. He wore rimless spectacles with 3
steel bows. His build and lower facial features were like other clergymen I had 3
seen, but he had a vastly higher forehead, and was darker and more intelligent- 3
looking- also more subtly and concealedly evil-looking. At the present moment- 3
having just lighted a faint oil lamp- he looked nervous, and before I knew it he 3
was casting all his magical books into a fireplace on the window side of the room 3
(where the wall slanted sharply) which I had not noticed before. The flames 3
devoured the volumes greedily- leaping up in strange colors and emitting 3
indescribably hideous odors as the strangely hieroglyphed leaves and wormy 3
bindings succumbed to the devastating element. All at once I saw there were 3
others in the room- grave-looking men in clerical costume, one of whom wore 3
the bands and knee-breeches of a bishop. Though I could hear nothing, I could 3
see that they were bringing a decision of vast import to the first-comer. They 3
seemed to hate and fear him at the same time, and he seemed to return these 3
sentiments. His face set itself into a grim expression, but I could see his right 3
hand shaking as he tried to grip the back of a chair. The bishop pointed to the 3
empty case and to the fireplace (where the flames had died down amidst a 3
charred, non-committal mass), and seemed filled with a peculiar loathing. The 3
first-comer then gave a wry smile and reached out with his left hand toward the 3
small object on the table. Everyone then seemed frightened. The procession of 3
clerics began filing down the steep stairs through the trapdoor in the floor, 3
turning and making menacing gestures as they left. The bishop was last to go. 3
3
The first-comer now went to a cupboard on the inner side of the room and 3
extracted a coil of rope. Mounting a chair, he attached one end of the rope to a 3
3
3
3
555 3
3
3
3
hook in the great exposed central beam of black oak, and began making a noose 3
with the other end. Realizing he was about to hang himself, I started forward to 3
dissuade or save him. He saw me and ceased his preparations, looking at me 3
with a kind of triumph which puzzled and disturbed me. He slowly stepped 3
down from the chair and began gliding toward me with a positively wolfish grin 3
on his dark, thin-lipped face. 3
3
I felt somehow in deadly peril, and drew out the peculiar ray-projector as a 3
weapon of defense. Why I thought it could help me, I do not know. I turned it 3
on- full in his face, and saw the sallow features glow first with violet and then 3
with pinkish light. His expression of wolfish exultation began to be crowded 3
aside by a look of profound fear- which did not, however, wholly displace the 3
exultation. He stopped in his tracks- then, flailing his arms wildly in the air, 3
began to stagger backwards. I saw he was edging toward the open stair-well in 3
the floor, and tried to shout a warning, but he did not hear me. In another instant 3
he had lurched backward through the opening and was lost to view. 3
3
I found difficulty in moving toward the stair-well, but when I did get there I 3
found no crushed body on the floor below. Instead there was a clatter of people 3
coming up with lanterns, for the spell of phantasmal silence had broken, and I 3
once more heard sounds and saw figures as normally tri-dimensional. Something 3
had evidently drawn a crowd to this place. Had there been a noise I had not 3
heard? 3
3
Presently the two people (simple villagers, apparently) farthest in the lead saw 3
me- and stood paralyzed. One of them shrieked loudly and reverberantly: 3
3
" Ahrrh! ... It be'ee, zur? Again?" 3
3
Then they all turned and fled frantically. All, that is, but one. When the crowd 3
was gone I saw the grave-bearded man who had brought me to this place- 3
standing alone with a lantern. He was gazing at me gaspingly and fascinatedly, 3
but did not seem afraid. Then he began to ascend the stairs, and joined me in the 3
attic. He spoke: 3
3
"So you didn't let it alone! I'm sorry. I know what has happened. It happened 3
once before, but the man got frightened and shot himself. You ought not to have 3
made him come back. You know what he wants. But you mustn't get frightened 3
like the other man he got. Something very strange and terrible has happened to 3
you, but it didn't get far enough to hurt your mind and personality. If you'll keep 3
cool, and accept the need for making certain radical readjustments in your life, 3
you can keep right on enjoying the world, and the fruits of your scholarship. But 3
3
3
3
556 3
3
3
3
you can't live here- and I don't think you'll wish to go back to London. I'd advise 3
America. 3
3
"You mustn't try anything more with that- thing. Nothing can be put back now. 3
It would only make matters worse to do- or summon- anything. You are not as 3
badly off as you might be- but you must get out of here at once and stay away. 3
You'd better thank Heaven it didn't go further. . . 3
3
"I'm going to prepare you as bluntly as I can. There's been a certain change- in 3
your personal appearance. He always causes that. But in a new country you can 3
get used to it. There's a mirror up at the other end of the room, and I'm going to 3
take you to it. You'll get a shock- though you will see nothing repulsive." 3
3
I was now shaking with a deadly fear, and the bearded man almost had to hold 3
me up as he walked me across the room to the mirror, the faint lamp (i.e., that 3
formerly on the table, not the still fainter lantern he had brought) in his free 3
hand. This is what I saw in the glass: 3
3
A thin, dark man of medium stature attired in the clerical garb of the Anglican 3
church, apparently about thirty, and with rimless, steel-bowed glasses glistening 3
beneath a sallow, olive forehead of abnormal height. 3
3
It was the silent first-comer who had burned his books. 3
3
For all the rest of my life, in outward form, I was to be that man 3

I was far from home, and the spell of the eastern sea was upon me. In the twilight 3
I heard it pounding on the rocks, and I knew it lay just over the hill where the 3
twisting willows writhed against the clearing sky and the first stars of evening. 3
And because my fathers had called me to the old town beyond, I pushed on 3
through the shallow, new-fallen snow along the road that soared lonely up to 3
where Aldebaran twinkled among the trees; on toward the very ancient town I 3
had never seen but often dreamed of. 3
3
It was the Yuletide, that men call Christmas though they know in their hearts it is 3
older than Bethlehem and Babylon, older than Memphis and mankind. It was the 3
Yuletide, and I had come at last to the ancient sea town where my people had 3
dwelt and kept festival in the elder time when festival was forbidden; where also 3
they had commanded their sons to keep festival once every century, that the 3
memory of primal secrets might not be forgotten. Mine were an old people, and 3
were old even when this land was settled three hundred years before. And they 3
were strange, because they had come as dark furtive folk from opiate southern 3
gardens of orchids, and spoken another tongue before they learnt the tongue of 3
the blue-eyed fishers. And now they were scattered, and shared only the rituals 3
of mysteries that none living could understand. I was the only one who came 3
back that night to the old fishing town as legend bade, for only the poor and the 3
lonely remember. 3
3
Then beyond the hill's crest I saw Kingsport outspread frostily in the gloaming; 3
snowy Kingsport with its ancient vanes and steeples, ridgepoles and chimney- 3
pots, wharves and small bridges, willow-trees and graveyards; endless 3
labyrinths of steep, narrow, crooked streets, and dizzy church-crowned central 3
peak that time durst not touch; ceaseless mazes of colonial houses piled and 3
scattered at all angles and levels like a child's disordered blocks; antiquity 3
hovering on grey wings over winter-whitened gables and gambrel roofs; 3
fanlights and small-paned windows one by one gleaming out in the cold dusk to 3
3
3
3
558 3
3
3
3
join Orion and the archaic stars. And against the rotting wharves the sea 3
pounded; the secretive, immemorial sea out of which the people had come in the 3
elder time. 3
3
Beside the road at its crest a still higher summit rose, bleak and windswept, and I 3
saw that it was a burying-ground where black gravestones stuck ghoulishly 3
through the snow like the decayed fingernails of a gigantic corpse. The printless 3
road was very lonely, and sometimes I thought I heard a distant horrible 3
creaking as of a gibbet in the wind. They had hanged four kinsmen of mine for 3
witchcraft in 1692, but I did not know just where. 3
3
As the road wound down the seaward slope I listened for the merry sounds of a 3
village at evening, but did not hear them. Then I thought of the season, and felt 3
that these old Puritan folk might well have Christmas customs strange to me, 3
and full of silent hearthside prayer. So after that I did not listen for merriment or 3
look for wayfarers, kept on down past the hushed lighted farmhouses and 3
shadowy stone walls to where the signs of ancient shops and sea taverns creaked 3
in the salt breeze, and the grotesque knockers of pillared doorways glistened 3
along deserted unpaved lanes in the light of little, curtained windows. 3
3
I had seen maps of the town, and knew where to find the home of my people. It 3
was told that I should be known and welcomed, for village legend lives long; so I 3
hastened through Back Street to Circle Court, and across the fresh snow on the 3
one full flagstone pavement in the town, to where Green Lane leads off behind 3
the Market House. The old maps still held good, and I had no trouble; though at 3
Arkham they must have lied when they said the trolleys ran to this place, since I 3
saw not a wire overhead. Snow would have hid the rails in any case. I was glad I 3
had chosen to walk, for the white village had seemed very beautiful from the hill; 3
and now I was eager to knock at the door of my people, the seventh house on the 3
left in Green Lane, with an ancient peaked roof and jutting second storey, all 3
built before 1650. 3
3
There were lights inside the house when I came upon it, and I saw from the 3
diamond window-panes that it must have been kept very close to its antique 3
state. The upper part overhung the narrow grass-grown street and nearly met the 3
over-hanging part of the house opposite, so that I was almost in a tunnel, with 3
the low stone doorstep wholly free from snow. There was no sidewalk, but many 3
houses had high doors reached by double flights of steps with iron railings. It 3
was an odd scene, and because I was strange to New England I had never known 3
its like before. Though it pleased me, I would have relished it better if there had 3
been footprints in the snow, and people in the streets, and a few windows 3
without drawn curtains. 3

3
When I sounded the archaic iron knocker I was half afraid. Some fear had been 3
gathering in me, perhaps because of the strangeness of my heritage, and the 3
bleakness of the evening, and the queerness of the silence in that aged town of 3
curious customs. And when my knock was answered I was fully afraid, because I 3
had not heard any footsteps before the door creaked open. But I was not afraid 3
long, for the gowned, slippered old man in the doorway had a bland face that 3
reassured me; and though he made signs that he was dumb, he wrote a quaint 3
and ancient welcome with the stylus and wax tablet he carried. 3
3
He beckoned me into a low, candle-lit room with massive exposed rafters and 3
dark, stiff, sparse furniture of the seventeenth century. The past was vivid there, 3
for not an attribute was missing. There was a cavernous fireplace and a spinning- 3
wheel at which a bent old woman in loose wrapper and deep poke-bonnet sat 3
back toward me, silently spinning despite the festive season. An indefinite 3
dampness seemed upon the place, and I marvelled that no fire should be blazing. 3
The high-backed settle faced the row of curtained windows at the left, and 3
seemed to be occupied, though I was not sure. I did not like everything about 3
what I saw, and felt again the fear I had had. This fear grew stronger from what 3
had before lessened it, for the more I looked at the old man's bland face the more 3
its very blandness terrified me. The eyes never moved, and the skin was too 3
much like wax. Finally I was sure it was not a face at all, but a fiendishly cunning 3
mask. But the flabby hands, curiously gloved, wrote genially on the tablet and 3
told me I must wait a while before I could be led to the place of the festival. 3
3
Pointing to a chair, table, and pile of books, the old man now left the room; and 3
when I sat down to read I saw that the books were hoary and mouldy, and that 3
they included old Morryster's wild Marvels of Science, the terrible Saducismus 3
Triumphatus of Joseph Glanvil, published in 1681, the shocking Daemonolatreja 3
of Remigius, printed in 1595 at Lyons, and worst of all, the unmentionable 3
Necronomicon of the mad Arab Abdul Alhazred, in Olaus Wormius' forbidden 3
Latin translation; a book which I had never seen, but of which I had heard 3
monstrous things whispered. No one spoke to me, but I could hear the creaking 3
of signs in the wind outside, and the whir of the wheel as the bonneted old 3
woman continued her silent spinning, spinning. I thought the room and the 3
books and the people very morbid and disquieting, but because an old tradition 3
of my fathers had summoned me to strange feastings, I resolved to expect queer 3
things. So I tried to read, and soon became tremblingly absorbed by something I 3
found in that accursed Necronomicon; a thought and a legend too hideous for 3
sanity or consciousness, but I disliked it when I fancied I heard the closing of one 3
of the windows that the settle faced, as if it had been stealthily opened. It had 3
seemed to follow a whirring that was not of the old woman's spinning-wheel. 3
This was not much, though, for the old woman was spinning very hard, and the 3
aged clock had been striking. After that I lost the feeling that there were persons 3
3
3
3
560 3
3
3
3
on the settle, and was reading intently and shudderingly when the old man came 3
back booted and dressed in a loose antique costume, and sat down on that very 3
bench, so that I could not see him. It was certainly nervous waiting, and the 3
blasphemous book in my hands made it doubly so. When eleven struck, 3
however, the old man stood up, glided to a massive carved chest in a corner, and 3
got two hooded cloaks; one of which he donned, and the other of which he 3
draped round the old woman, who was ceasing her monotonous spinning. Then 3
they both started for the outer door; the woman lamely creeping, and the old 3
man, after picking up the very book I had been reading, beckoning me as he 3
drew his hood over that unmoving face or mask. 3
3
We went out into the moonless and tortuous network of that incredibly ancient 3
town; went out as the lights in the curtained windows disappeared one by one, 3
and the Dog Star leered at the throng of cowled, cloaked figures that poured 3
silently from every doorway and formed monstrous processions up this street 3
and that, past the creaking signs and antediluvian gables, the thatched roofs and 3
diamond-paned windows; threading precipitous lanes where decaying houses 3
overlapped and crumbled together; gliding across open courts and churchyards 3
where the bobbing lanthorns made eldritch drunken constellations. 3
3
Amid these hushed throngs I followed my voiceless guides; jostled by elbows 3
that seemed preternaturally soft, and pressed by chests and stomachs that 3
seemed abnormally pulpy; but seeing never a face and hearing never a word. Up, 3
up, up, the eery columns slithered, and I saw that all the travellers were 3
converging as they flowed near a sort of focus of crazy alleys at the top of a high 3
hill in the centre of the town, where perched a great white church. I had seen it 3
from the road's crest when I looked at Kingsport in the new dusk, and it had 3
made me shiver because Aldebaran had seemed to balance itself a moment on 3
the ghostly spire. 3

There was an open space around the church; partly a churchyard with spectral 3
shafts, and partly a half-paved square swept nearly bare of snow by the wind, 3
and lined with unwholesomely archaic houses having peaked roofs and 3
overhanging gables. Death-fires danced over the tombs, revealing gruesome 3
vistas, though queerly failing to cast any shadows. Past the churchyard, where 3
there were no houses, I could see over the hill's summit and watch the glimmer 3
of stars on the harbour, though the town was invisible in the dark. Only once in a 3
while a lantern bobbed horribly through serpentine alleys on its way to overtake 3
the throng that was now slipping speechlessly into the church. I waited till the 3
crowd had oozed into the black doorway, and till all the stragglers had followed. 3
The old man was pulling at my sleeve, but I was determined to be the last. 3
Crossing the threshold into the swarming temple of unknown darkness, I turned 3
once to look at the outside world as the churchyard phosphorescence cast a 3
3
3
3
561 3
3
3
3
sickly glow on the hilltop pavement. And as I did so I shuddered. For though the 3
wind had not left much snow, a few patches did remain on the path near the 3
door; and in that fleeting backward look it seemed to my troubled eyes that they 3
bore no mark of passing feet, not even mine. 3
3
The church was scarce lighted by all the lanthorns that had entered it, for most of 3
the throng had already vanished. They had streamed up the aisle between the 3
high pews to the trap-door of the vaults which yawned loathsomely open just 3
before the pulpit, and were now squinning noiselessly in. I followed dumbly 3
down the foot-worn steps and into the dark, suffocating crypt. The tail of that 3
sinuous line of night-marchers seemed very horrible, and as I saw them 3
wriggling into a venerable tomb they seemed more horrible still. Then I noticed 3
that the tomb's floor had an aperture down which the throng was sliding, and in 3
a moment we were all descending an ominous staircase of rough-hewn stone; a 3
narrow spiral staircase damp and peculiarly odorous, that wound endlessly 3
down into the bowels of the hill past monotonous walls of dripping stone blocks 3
and crumbling mortar. It was a silent, shocking descent, and I observed after a 3
horrible interval that the walls and steps were changing in nature, as if chiselled 3
out of the solid rock. What mainly troubled me was that the myriad footfalls 3
made no sound and set up no echoes. After more aeons of descent I saw some 3
side passages or burrows leading from unknown recesses of blackness to this 3
shaft of nighted mystery. Soon they became excessively numerous, like impious 3
catacombs of nameless menace; and their pungent odour of decay grew quite 3
unbearable. I knew we must have passed down through the mountain and 3
beneath the earth of Kingsport itself, and I shivered that a town should be so 3
aged and maggoty with subterraneous evil. 3
3
Then I saw the lurid shimmering of pale light, and heard the insidious lapping of 3
sunless waters. Again I shivered, for I did not like the things that the night had 3
brought, and wished bitterly that no forefather had summoned me to this primal 3
rite. As the steps and the passage grew broader, I heard another sound, the thin, 3
whining mockery of a feeble flute; and suddenly there spread out before me the 3
boundless vista of an inner world- a vast fungous shore litten by a belching 3
column of sick greenish flame and washed by a wide oily river that flowed from 3
abysses frightful and unsuspected to join the blackest gulfs of immemorial ocean. 3
3
Fainting and gasping, I looked at that unhallowed Erebus of titan toadstools, 3
leprous fire and slimy water, and saw the cloaked throngs forming a semicircle 3
around the blazing pillar. It was the Yule-rite, older than man and fated to 3
survive him; the primal rite of the solstice and of spring's promise beyond the 3
snows; the rite of fire and evergreen, light and music. And in the stygian grotto I 3
saw them do the rite, and adore the sick pillar of flame, and throw into the water 3
handfuls gouged out of the viscous vegetation which glittered green in the 3
3
3
3
562 3
3
3
3
chlorotic glare. I saw this, and I saw something amorphously squatted far away 3
from the light, piping noisomely on a flute; and as the thing piped I thought I 3
heard noxious muffled flutterings in the foetid darkness where I could not see. 3
But what frightened me most was that flaming column; spouting volcanically 3
from depths profound and inconceivable, casting no shadows as healthy flame 3
should, and coating the nitrous stone with a nasty, venomous verdigris. For in all 3
that seething combustion no warmth lay, but only the clamminess of death and 3
corruption. 3
3
The man who had brought me now squirmed to a point directly beside the 3
hideous flame, and made stiff ceremonial motions to the semi-circle he faced. At 3
certain stages of the ritual they did grovelling obeisance, especially when he held 3
above his head that abhorrent Necronomicon he had taken with him; and I 3
shared all the obeisances because I had been summoned to this festival by the 3
writings of my forefathers. Then the old man made a signal to the half-seen flute- 3
player in the darkness, which player thereupon changed its feeble drone to a 3
scarce louder drone in another key; precipitating as it did so a horror 3
unthinkable and unexpected. At this horror I sank nearly to the lichened earth, 3
transfixed with a dread not of this or any world, but only of the mad spaces 3
between the stars. 3
3
Out of the unimaginable blackness beyond the gangrenous glare of that cold 3
flame, out of the tartarean leagues through which that oily river rolled uncanny, 3
unheard, and unsuspected, there flopped rhythmically a horde of tame, trained, 3
hybrid winged things that no sound eye could ever wholly grasp, or sound brain 3
ever wholly remember. They were not altogether crows, nor moles, nor 3
buzzards, nor ants, nor vampire bats, nor decomposed human beings; but 3
something I cannot and must not recall. They flopped limply along, half with 3
their webbed feet and half with their membranous wings; and as they reached 3
the throng of celebrants the cowled figures seized and mounted them, and rode 3
off one by one along the reaches of that unlighted river, into pits and galleries of 3
panic where poison springs feed frightful and undiscoverable cataracts. 3
3
The old spinning woman had gone with the throng, and the old man remained 3
only because I had refused when he motioned me to seize an animal and ride like 3
the rest. I saw when I staggered to my feet that the amorphous flute-player had 3
rolled out of sight, but that two of the beasts were patiently standing by. As I 3
hung back, the old man produced his stylus and tablet and wrote that he was the 3
true deputy of my fathers who had founded the Yule worship in this ancient 3
place; that it had been decreed I should come back, and that the most secret 3
mysteries were yet to be performed. He wrote this in a very ancient hand, and 3
when I still hesitated he pulled from his loose robe a seal ring and a watch, both 3
with my family arms, to prove that he was what he said. But it was a hideous 3
3
3
3
563 3
3
3
3
proof, because I knew from old papers that that watch had been buried with my 3
great-great-great-great-grandfather in 1698. 3
3
Presently the old man drew back his hood and pointed to the family resemblance 3
in his face, but I only shuddered, because I was sure that the face was merely a 3
devilish waxen mask. The flopping animals were now scratching restlessly at the 3
lichens, and I saw that the old man was nearly as restless himself. When one of 3
the things began to waddle and edge away, he turned quickly to stop it; so that 3
the suddenness of his motion dislodged the waxen mask from what should have 3
been his head. And then, because that nightmare's position barred me from the 3
stone staircase down which we had come, I flung myself into the oily 3
underground river that bubbled somewhere to the caves of the sea; flung myself 3
into that putrescent juice of earth's inner horrors before the madness of my 3
screams could bring down upon me all the charnel legions these pest-gulfs might 3
conceal. 3
3
At the hospital they told me I had been found half-frozen in Kingsport Harbour 3
at dawn, clinging to the drifting spar that accident sent to save me. They told me 3
I had taken the wrong fork of the hill road the night before, and fallen over the 3
cliffs at Orange Point; a thing they deduced from prints found in the snow. There 3
was nothing I could say, because everything was wrong. Everything was wrong, 3
with the broad windows showing a sea of roofs in which only about one in five 3
was ancient, and the sound of trolleys and motors in the streets below. They 3
insisted that this was Kingsport, and I could not deny it. When I went delirious 3
at hearing that the hospital stood near the old churchyard on Central Hill, they 3
sent me to St Mary's Hospital in Arkham, where I could have better care. I liked 3
it there, for the doctors were broad-minded, and even lent me their influence in 3
obtaining the carefully sheltered copy of Alhazred's objectionable Necronomicon 3
from the library of Miskatonic University. They said something about a 3
"psychosis" and agreed I had better get any harassing obsessions off my mind. 3
3
So I read that hideous chapter, and shuddered doubly because it was indeed not 3
new to me. I had seen it before, let footprints tell what they might; and where it 3
was I had seen it were best forgotten. There was no one- in waking hours- who 3
could remind me of it; but my dreams are filled with terror, because of phrases I 3
dare not quote. I dare quote only one paragraph, put into such English as I can 3
make from the awkward Low Latin. 3
3
"The nethermost caverns," wrote the mad Arab, "are not for the fathoming of 3
eyes that see; for their marvels are strange and terrific. Cursed the ground where 3
dead thoughts live new and oddly bodied, and evil the mind that is held by no 3
head. Wisely did Ibn Schacabao say, that happy is the tomb where no wizard 3
hath lain, and happy the town at night whose wizards are all ashes. For it is of 3
3

old rumour that the soul of the devil-bought hastes not from his charnel clay, but 3
fats and instructs the very worm that gnaws; till out of corruption horrid life 3
springs, and the dull scavengers of earth wax crafty to vex it and swell 3
monstrous to plague it. Great holes secretly are digged where earth's pores ought 3
to suffice, and things have learnt to walk that ought to crawl." 3

Cautious investigators will hesitate to challenge the common belief that Robert 3
Blake was killed by lightning, or by some profound nervous shock derived from 3
an electrical discharge. It is true that the window he faced was unbroken, but 3
nature has shown herself capable of many freakish performances. The expression 3
on his face may easily have arisen from some obscure muscular source unrelated 3
to anything he saw, while the entries in his diary are clearly the result of a 3
fantastic imagination aroused by certain local superstitions and by certain old 3
matters he had uncovered. As for the anomalous conditions at the deserted 3
church of Federal Hill- the shrewd analyst is not slow in attributing them to 3
some charlatanry, conscious or unconscious, with at least some of which Blake 3
was secretly connected. 3
3
For after all, the victim was a writer and painter wholly devoted to the field of 3
myth, dream, terror, and superstition, and avid in his quest for scenes and effects 3
of a bizarre, spectral sort. His earlier stay in the city -a visit to a strange old man 3
as deeply given to occult and forbidden lore as he- had ended amidst death and 3
flame, and it must have been some morbid instinct which drew him back from 3
his home in Milwaukee. He may have known of the old stories despite his 3
statements to the contrary in the diary, and his death may have nipped in the 3
bud some stupendous hoax destined to have a literary reflection. 3
3
Among those, however, who have examined and correlated all this evidence, 3
there remain several who cling to less rational and commonplace theories. They 3
are inclined to take much of Blake's diary at its face value, and point significantly 3
to certain facts such as the undoubted genuineness of the old church record, the 3
verified existence of the disliked and unorthodox Starry Wisdom sect prior to 3
1877, the recorded disappearance of an inquisitive reporter named Edwin M. 3
Lillibridge in 1893, and- above all- the look of monstrous, transfiguring fear on 3
the face of the young writer when he died. It was one of these believers who, 3
moved to fanatical extremes, threw into the bay the curiously angled stone and 3
its strangely adorned metal box found in the old church steeple- the black 3
3
3
3
566 3
3
3
3
windowless steeple, and not the tower where Blake's diary said those things 3
originally were. Though widely censured both officially and unofficially, this 3
man- a reputable physician with a taste for odd folklore- averred that he had rid 3
the earth of something too dangerous to rest upon it. 3
3
Between these two schools of opinion the reader must judge for himself. The 3
papers have given the tangible details from a sceptical angle, leaving for others 3
the drawing of the picture as Robert Blake saw it- or thought he saw it- or 3
pretended to see it. Now studying the diary closely, dispassionately, and at 3
leisure, let us summarize the dark chain of events from the expressed point of 3
view of their chief actor. 3
3
Young Blake returned to Providence in the winter of 1934-5, taking the upper 3
floor of a venerable dwelling in a grassy court off College Street- on the crest of 3
the great eastward hill near the Brown University campus and behind the marble 3
John Hay Library. It was a cosy and fascinating place, in a little garden oasis of 3
village-like antiquity where huge, friendly cats sunned themselves atop a 3
convenient shed. The square Georgian house had a monitor roof, classic doorway 3
with fan carving, small-paned windows, and all the other earmarks of early 3
nineteenth century workmanship. Inside were six-panelled doors, wide floor- 3
boards, a curving colonial staircase, white Adam-period mantels, and a rear set 3
of rooms three steps below the general level. 3
3
Blake's study, a large southwest chamber, overlooked the front garden on one 3
side, while its west windows- before one of which he had his desk- faced off 3
from the brow of the hill and commanded a splendid view of the lower town's 3
outspread roofs and of the mystical sunsets that flamed behind them. On the far 3
horizon were the open countryside's purple slopes. Against these, some two 3
miles away, rose the spectral hump of Federal Hill, bristling with huddled roofs 3
and steeples whose remote outlines wavered mysteriously, taking fantastic forms 3
as the smoke of the city swirled up and enmeshed them. Blake had a curious 3
sense that he was looking upon some unknown, ethereal world which might or 3
might not vanish in dream if ever he tried to seek it out and enter it in person. 3
3
Having sent home for most of his books, Blake bought some antique furniture 3
suitable for his quarters and settled down to write and paint- living alone, and 3
attending to the simple housework himself. His studio was in a north attic room, 3
where the panes of the monitor roof furnished admirable lighting. During that 3
first winter he produced five of his best-known short stories- The Burrower 3
Beneath, The Stairs in the Crypt, Shaggai, In the Vale of Pnath, and The Feaster 3
from the Stars- and painted seven canvases; studies of nameless, unhuman 3
monsters, and profoundly alien, non-terrestrial landscapes. 3

At sunset he would often sit at his desk and gaze dreamily off at the outspread 3
west- the dark towers of Memorial Hall just below, the Georgian court-house 3
belfry, the lofty pinnacles of the downtown section, and that shimmering, spire- 3
crowned mound in the distance whose unknown streets and labyrinthine gables 3
so potently provoked his fancy. From his few local aquaintances he learned that 3
the far-off slope was a vast Italian quarter, though most of the houses were 3
remnant of older Yankee and Irish days. Now and then he would train his field- 3
glasses on that spectral, unreachable world beyond the curling smoke; picking 3
out individual roofs and chimneys and steeples, and speculating upon the 3
bizarre and curious mysteries they might house. Even with optical aid Federal 3
Hill seemed somehow alien, half fabulous, and linked to the unreal, intangible 3
marvels of Blake's own tales and pictures. The feeling would persist long after 3
the hill had faded into the violet, lamp-starred twilight, and the court-house 3
floodlights and the red Industrial Trust beacon had blazed up to make the night 3
grotesque. 3
3
Of all the distant objects on Federal Hill, a certain huge, dark church most 3
fascinated Blake. It stood out with especial distinctness at certain hours of the 3
day, and at sunset the great tower and tapering steeple loomed blackly against 3
the flaming sky. It seemed to rest on especially high ground; for the grimy 3
fagade, and the obliquely seen north side with sloping roof and the tops of great 3
pointed windows, rose boldly above the tangle of surrounding ridgepoles and 3
chimney-pots. Peculiarly grim and austere, it appeared to be built of stone, 3
stained and weathered with the smoke and storms of a century and more. The 3
style, so far as the glass could show, was that earliest experimental form of 3
Gothic revival which preceded the stately Upjohn period and held over some of 3
the outlines and proportions of the Georgian age. Perhaps it was reared around 3
1810 or 1815. 3
3
As months passed, Blake watched the far-off, forbidding structure with an oddly 3
mounting interest. Since the vast windows were never lighted, he knew that it 3
must be vacant. The longer he watched, the more his imagination worked, till at 3
length he began to fancy curious things. He believed that a vague, singular aura 3
of desolation hovered over the place, so that even the pigeons and swallows 3
shunned its smoky eaves. Around other towers and belfries his glass would 3
reveal great flocks of birds, but here they never rested. At least, that is what he 3
thought and set down in his diary. He pointed the place out to several friends, 3
but none of them had even been on Federal Hill or possessed the faintest notion 3
of what the church was or had been. 3
3
In the spring a deep restlessness gripped Blake. He had begun his long-planned 3
novel- based on a supposed survival of the witch-cult in Maine- but was 3
strangely unable to make progress with it. More and more he would sit at his 3
3
3
3
568 3
3
3
3
westward window and gaze at the distant hill and the black, frowning steeple 3
shunned by the birds. When the delicate leaves came out on the garden boughs 3
the world was filled with a new beauty, but Blake's restlessness was merely 3
increased. It was then that he first thought of crossing the city and climbing 3
bodily up that fabulous slope into the smoke-wreathed world of dream. 3
3
Late in April, just before the aeon-shadowed Walpurgis time, Blake made his 3
first trip into the unknown. Plodding through the endless downtown streets and 3
the bleak, decayed squares beyond, he came finally upon the ascending avenue 3
of century -worn steps, sagging Doric porches, and blear-paned cupolas which he 3
felt must lead up to the long-known, unreachable world beyond the mists. There 3
were dingy blue-and-white street signs which meant nothing to him, and 3
presently he noted the strange, dark faces of the drifting crowds, and the foreign 3
signs over curious shops in brown, decade-weathered buildings. Nowhere could 3
he find any of the objects he had seen from afar; so that once more he half fancied 3
that the Federal Hill of that distant view was a dream-world never to be trod by 3
living human feet. 3
3
Now and then a battered church fagade or crumbling spire came in sight, but 3
never the blackened pile that he sought. When he asked a shopkeeper about a 3
great stone church the man smiled and shook his head, though he spoke English 3
freely. As Blake climbed higher, the region seemed stranger and stranger, with 3
bewildering mazes of brooding brown alleys leading eternally off to the south. 3
He crossed two or three broad avenues, and once thought he glimpsed a familiar 3
tower. Again he asked a merchant about the massive church of stone, and this 3
time he could have sworn that the plea of ignorance was feigned. The dark man's 3
face had a look of fear which he tried to hide, and Blake saw him make a curious 3
sign with his right hand. 3
3
Then suddenly a black spire stood out against the cloudy sky on his left, above 3
the tiers of brown roofs lining the tangled southerly alleys. Blake knew at once 3
what it was, and plunged toward it through the squalid, unpaved lanes that 3
climbed from the avenue. Twice he lost his way, but he somehow dared not ask 3
any of the patriarchs or housewives who sat on their doorsteps, or any of the 3
children who shouted and played in the mud of the shadowy lanes. 3
3
At last he saw the tower plain against the southwest, and a huge stone bulk rose 3
darkly at the end of an alley. Presently he stood in a wind-swept open square, 3
quaintly cobblestoned, with a high bank wall on the farther side. This was the 3
end of his quest; for upon the wide, iron-railed, weed-grown plateau which the 3
wall supported- a separate, lesser world raised fully six feet above the 3
surrounding streets- there stood a grim, titan bulk whose identity, despite 3
Blake's new perspective, was beyond dispute. 3
3
3
3
569 3
3
3
3
The vacant church was in a state of great decrepitude. Some of the high stone 3
buttresses had fallen, and several delicate finials lay half lost among the brown, 3
neglected weeds and grasses. The sooty Gothic windows were largely unbroken, 3
though many of the stone muUions were missing. Blake wondered how the 3
obscurely painted panes could have survived so well, in view of the known 3
habits of small boys the world over. The massive doors were intact and tightly 3
closed. Around the top of the bank wall, fully enclosing the grounds, was a rusty 3
iron fence whose gate- at the head of a flight of steps from the square- was 3
visibly padlocked. The path from the gate to the building was completely 3
overgrown. Desolation and decay hung like a pall above the place, and in the 3
birdless eaves and black, ivyless walls Blake felt a touch of the dimly sinister 3
beyond his power to define. 3
3
There were very few people in the square, but Blake saw a policeman at the 3
northerly end and approached him with questions about the church. He was a 3
great wholesome Irishman, and it seemed odd that he would do little more than 3
make the sign of the cross and mutter that people never spoke of that building. 3
When Blake pressed him he said very hurriedly that the Italian priest warned 3
everybody against it, vowing that a monstrous evil had once dwelt there and left 3
its mark. He himself had heard dark whispers of it from his father, who recalled 3
certain sounds and rumours from his boyhood. 3
3
There had been a bad sect there in the old days- an outlaw sect that called up 3
awful things from some unknown gulf of night. It had taken a good priest to 3
exorcise what had come, though there did be those who said that merely the 3
light could do it. If Father O'Malley were alive there would be many a thing he 3
could tell. But now there was nothing to do but let it alone. It hurt nobody now, 3
and those that owned it were dead or far away. They had run away like rats after 3
the threatening talk in '77 , when people began to mind the way folks vanished 3
now and then in the neighbourhood. Some day the city would step in and take 3
the property for lack of heirs, but little good would come of anybody's touching 3
it. Better it be left alone for the years to topple, lest things be stirred that ought to 3
rest forever in their black abyss. 3
3
After the policeman had gone Blake stood staring at the sullen steepled pile. It 3
excited him to find that the structure seemed as sinister to others as to him, and 3
he wondered what grain of truth might lie behind the old tales the bluecoat had 3
repeated. Probably they were mere legends evoked by the evil look of the place, 3
but even so, they were like a strange coming to life of one of his own stories. 3
3
The afternoon sun came out from behind dispersing clouds, but seemed unable 3
to light up the stained, sooty walls of the old temple that towered on its high 3
plateau. It was odd that the green of spring had not touched the brown, withered 3
3
3
3
570 3
3
3
3
growths in the raised, iron-fenced yard. Blake found himself edging nearer the 3
raised area and examining the bank wall and rusted fence for possible avenues of 3
ingress. There was a terrible lure about the blackened fane which was not to be 3
resisted. The fence had no opening near the steps, but round on the north side 3
were some missing bars. He could go up the steps and walk round on the narrow 3
coping outside the fence till he came to the gap. If the people feared the place so 3
wildly, he would encounter no interference. 3
3
He was on the embankment and almost inside the fence before anyone noticed 3
him. Then, looking down, he saw the few people in the square edging away and 3
making the same sign with their right hands that the shopkeeper in the avenue 3
had made. Several windows were slammed down, and a fat woman darted into 3
the street and pulled some small children inside a rickety, unpainted house. The 3
gap in the fence was very easy to pass through, and before long Blake found 3
himself wading amidst the rotting, tangled growths of the deserted yard. Here 3
and there the worn stump of a headstone told him that there had once been 3
burials in the field; but that, he saw, must have been very long ago. The sheer 3
bulk of the church was oppressive now that he was close to it, but he conquered 3
his mood and approached to try the three great doors in the fagade. All were 3
securely locked, so he began a circuit of the Cyclopean building in quest of some 3
minor and more penetrable opening. Even then he could not be sure that he 3
wished to enter that haunt of desertion and shadow, yet the pull of its 3
strangeness dragged him on automatically. 3
3
A yawning and unprotected cellar window in the rear furnished the needed 3
aperture. Peering in, Blake saw a subterrene gulf of cobwebs and dust faintly 3
litten by the western sun's filtered rays. Debris, old barrels, and ruined boxes and 3
furniture of numerous sorts met his eye, though over everything lay a shroud of 3
dust which softened all sharp outlines. The rusted remains of a hot-air furnace 3
showed that the building had been used and kept in shape as late as mid- 3
Victorian times. 3
3
Acting almost without conscious initiative, Blake crawled through the window 3
and let himself down to the dust-carpeted and debris-strewn concrete floor. The 3
vaulted cellar was a vast one, without partitions; and in a corner far to the right, 3
amid dense shadows, he saw a black archway evidently leading upstairs. He felt 3
a peculiar sense of oppression at being actually within the great spectral 3
building, but kept it in check as he cautiously scouted about- finding a still-intact 3
barrel amid the dust, and rolling it over to the open window to provide for his 3
exit. Then, bracing himself, he crossed the wide, cobweb-festooned space toward 3
the arch. Half-choked with the omnipresent dust, and covered with ghostly 3
gossamer fibres, he reached and began to climb the worn stone steps which rose 3
into the darkness. He had no light, but groped carefully with his hands. After a 3
3
3
3
571 3
3
3
3
sharp turn he feh a closed door ahead, and a httle fumbHng revealed its ancient 3
latch. It opened inward, and beyond it he saw a dimly illumined corridor lined 3
with worm-eaten panelling. 3
3
Once on the ground floor, Blake began exploring in a rapid fashion. All the inner 3
doors were unlocked, so that he freely passed from room to room. The colossal 3
nave was an almost eldritch place with its drifts and mountains of dust over box 3
pews, altar, hour-glass pulpit, and sounding-board and its titanic ropes of 3
cobweb stretching among the pointed arches of the gallery and entwining the 3
clustered Gothic columns. Over all this hushed desolation played a hideous 3
leaden light as the declining afternoon sun sent its rays through the strange, half- 3
blackened panes of the great apsidal windows. 3
3
The paintings on those windows were so obscured by soot that Blake could 3
scarcely decipher what they had represented, but from the little he could make 3
out he did not like them. The designs were largely conventional, and his 3
knowledge of obscure symbolism told him much concerning some of the ancient 3
patterns. The few saints depicted bore expressions distinctly open to criticism, 3
while one of the windows seemed to show merely a dark space with spirals of 3
curious luminosity scattered about in it. Turning away from the windows, Blake 3
noticed that the cobwebbed cross above the altar was not of the ordinary kind, 3
but resembled the primordial ankh or crux ansata of shadowy Egypt. 3
3
In a rear vestry room beside the apse Blake found a rotting desk and ceiling-high 3
shelves of mildewed, disintegrating books. Here for the first time he received a 3
positive shock of objective horror, for the titles of those books told him much. 3
They were the black, forbidden things which most sane people have never even 3
heard of, or have heard of only in furtive, timorous whispers; the banned and 3
dreaded repositories of equivocal secret and immemorial formulae which have 3
trickled down the stream of time from the days of man's youth, and the dim, 3
fabulous days before man was. He had himself read many of them- a Latin 3
version of the abhorred Necronomicon, the sinister Liber Ivonis, the infamous 3
Cultes des Goules of Comte d'Erlette, the Unaussprechlichen Kulten of von 3
Junzt, and old Ludvig Prinn's hellish De Vermis Mysteriis. But there were others 3
he had known merely by reputation or not at all- the Pnakotic Manuscripts, the 3
Book of Dzyan, and a crumbling volume of wholly unidentifiable characters yet 3
with certain symbols and diagrams shuddering recognizable to the occult 3
student. Clearly, the lingering local rumours had not lied. This place had once 3
been the seat of an evil older than mankind and wider than the known universe. 3
3
In the ruined desk was a small leatherbound record-book filled with entries in 3
some odd cryptographic medium. The manuscript writing consisted of the 3
common traditional symbols used today in astronomy and anciently in alchemy. 3
3
3
3

3
3
3
astrology, and other dubious arts- the devices of the sun, moon, planets, aspects, 3
and zodiacal signs- here massed in solid pages of text, with divisions and 3
paragraphings suggesting that each symbol answered to some alphabetical letter. 3
3
In the hope of later solving the cryptogram, Blake bore off this volume in his coat 3
pocket. Many of the great tomes on the shelves fascinated him unutterably, and 3
he felt tempted to borrow them at some later time. He wondered how they could 3
have remained undisturbed so long. Was he the first to conquer the clutching, 3
pervasive fear which had for nearly sixty years protected this deserted place 3
from visitors? 3
3
Having now thoroughly explored the ground floor, Blake ploughed again 3
through the dust of the spectral nave to the front vestibule, where he had seen a 3
door and staircase presumably leading up to the blackened tower and steeple- 3
objects so long familiar to him at a distance. The ascent was a choking 3
experience, for dust lay thick, while the spiders had done their worst in this 3
constricted place. The staircase was a spiral with high, narrow wooden treads, 3
and now and then Blake passed a clouded window looking dizzily out over the 3
city. Though he had seen no ropes below, he expected to find a bell or peal of 3
bells in the tower whose narrow, louvre-boarded lancet windows his field-glass 3
had studied so often. Here he was doomed to disappointment; for when he 3
attained the top of the stairs he found the tower chamber vacant of chimes, and 3
clearly devoted to vastly different purposes. 3
3
The room, about fifteen feet square, was faintly lighted by four lancet windows, 3
one on each side, which were glazed within their screening of decayed louvre- 3
boards. These had been further fitted with tight, opaque screens, but the latter 3
were now largely rotted away. In the centre of the dust-laden floor rose a 3
curiously angled stone pillar home four feet in height and two in average 3
diameter, covered on each side with bizarre, crudely incised and wholly 3
unrecognizable hieroglyphs. On this pillar rested a metal box of peculiarly 3
asymmetrical form; its hinged lid thrown back, and its interior holding what 3
looked beneath the decade-deep dust to be an egg-shaped or irregularly 3
spherical object some four inches through. Around the pillar in a rough circle 3
were seven high-backed Gothic chairs still largely intact, while behind them, 3
ranging along the dark-panelled walls, were seven colossal images of crumbling, 3
black-painted plaster, resembling more than anything else the cryptic carven 3
megaliths of mysterious Easter Island. In one corner of the cobw ebbed chamber a 3
ladder was built into the wall, leading up to the closed trap door of the 3
windowless steeple above. 3
3
As Blake grew accustomed to the feeble light he noticed odd bas-reliefs on the 3
strange open box of yellowish metal. Approaching, he tried to clear the dust 3
3
3
3
573 3
3
3
3
away with his hands and handkerchief, and saw that the figurings were of a 3
monstrous and utterly ahen kind; depicting entities which, though seemingly 3
alive, resembled no known life-form ever evolved on this planet. The four-inch 3
seeming sphere turned out to be a nearly black, red-striated polyhedron with 3
many irregular flat surfaces; either a very remarkable crystal of some sort or an 3
artificial object of carved and highly polished mineral matter. It did not touch the 3
bottom of the box, but was held suspended by means of a metal band around its 3
centre, with seven queerly-designed supports extending horizontally to angles of 3
the box's inner wall near the top. This stone, once exposed, exerted upon Blake 3
an almost alarming fascination. He could scarcely tear his eyes from it, and as he 3
looked at its glistening surfaces he almost fancied it was transparent, with half- 3
formed worlds of wonder within. Into his mind floated pictures of alien orbs 3
with great stone towers, and other orbs with titan mountains and no mark of life, 3
and still remoter spaces where only a stirring in vague blacknesses told of the 3
presence of consciousness and will. 3
3
When he did look away, it was to notice a somewhat singular mound of dust in 3
the far corner near the ladder to the steeple. Just why it took his attention he 3
could not tell, but something in its contours carried a message to his unconscious 3
mind. Ploughing toward it, and brushing aside the hanging cobwebs as he went, 3
he began to discern something grim about it. Hand and handkerchief soon 3
revealed the truth, and Blake gasped with a baffling mixture of emotions. It was 3
a human skeleton, and it must have been there for a very long time. The clothing 3
was in shreds, but some buttons and fragments of cloth bespoke a man's grey 3
suit. There were other bits of evidence- shoes, metal clasps, huge buttons for 3
round cuffs, a stickpin of bygone pattern, a reporter's badge with the name of the 3
old Providence Telegram, and a crumbling leather pocketbook. Blake examined 3
the latter with care, finding within it several bills of antiquated issue, a celluloid 3
advertising calendar for 1893, some cards with the name "Edwin M. Lillibridge", 3
and a paper covered with pencilled memoranda. 3
3
This paper held much of a puzzling nature, and Blake read it carefully at the dim 3
westward window. Its disjointed text included such phrases as the following: 3

3
Restoring the paper to the pocketbook and placing the latter in his coat, Blake 3
turned to look down at the skeleton in the dust. The implications of the notes 3
were clear, and there could be no doubt but that this man had come to the 3
deserted edifice forty-two years before in quest of a newspaper sensation which 3
no one else had been bold enough to attempt. Perhaps no one else had known of 3
his plan - who could tell? But he had never returned to his paper. Had some 3
bravely-suppressed fear risen to overcome him and bring on sudden heart- 3
failure? Blake stooped over the gleaming bones and noted their peculiar state. 3
Some of them were badly scattered, and a few seemed oddly dissolved at the 3
ends. Others were strangely yellowed, with vague suggestions of charring. This 3
charring extended to some of the fragments of clothing. The skull was in a very 3
3
3
3
bib 3
3
3
3
peculiar state - stained yellow, and with a charred aperture in the top as if some 3
powerful acid had eaten through the solid bone. What had happened to the 3
skeleton during its four decades of silent entombment here Blake could not 3
imagine. 3
3
Before he realized it, he was looking at the stone again, and letting its curious 3
influence call up a nebulous pageantry in his mind. He saw processions of robed, 3
hooded figures whose outlines were not human, and looked on endless leagues 3
of desert lined with carved, sky-reaching monoliths. He saw towers and walls in 3
nighted depths under the sea, and vortices of space where wisps of black mist 3
floated before thin shimmerings of cold purple haze. And beyond all else he 3
glimpsed an infinite gulf of darkness, where solid and semisolid forms were 3
known only by their windy stirrings, and cloudy patterns of force seemed to 3
superimpose order on chaos and hold forth a key to all the paradoxes and arcana 3
of the worlds we know. 3
3
Then all at once the spell was broken by an access of gnawing, indeterminate 3
panic fear. Blake choked and turned away from the stone, conscious of some 3
formless alien presence close to him and watching him with horrible intentness. 3
He felt entangled with something- something which was not in the stone, but 3
which had looked through it at him- something which would ceaselessly follow 3
him with a cognition that was not physical sight. Plainly, the place was getting 3
on his nerves- as well it might in view of his gruesome find. The light was 3
waning, too, and since he had no illuininant with him he knew he would have to 3
be leaving soon. 3
3
It was then, in the gathering twilight, that he thought he saw a faint trace of 3
luminosity in the crazily angled stone. He had tried to look away from it, but 3
some obscure compulsion drew his eyes hack. Was there a subtle 3
phosphorescence of radio-activity about the thing? What was it that the dead 3
man 's notes had said concerning a Shining Trapezohedron? What, anyway, was 3
this abandoned lair of cosmic evil? What had been done here, and what might 3
still be lurking in the bird-shunned shadows? It seemed now as if an elusive 3
touch of foetor had arisen somewhere close by, though its source was not 3
apparent. Blake seized the cover of the long-open box and snapped it down. It 3
moved easily on its alien hinges, and closed completely over the unmistakably 3
glowing stone. 3
3
At the sharp click of that closing a soft stirring sound seemed to come from the 3
steeple's eternal blackness overhead, beyond the trap-door. Rats, without 3
question- the only living things to reveal their presence in this accursed pile since 3
he had entered it. And yet that stirring in the steeple frightened him horribly, so 3
that he plunged almost wildly down the spiral stairs, across the ghoulish nave. 3
3
3
3
576 3
3
3
3
into the vaulted basement, out amidst the gathering dust of the deserted square, 3
and down through the teeming, fear-haunted alleys and avenues of Federal Hill 3
towards the sane central streets and the home-like brick sidewalks of the college 3
district. 3
3
During the days which followed, Blake told no one of his expedition. Instead, he 3
read much in certain books, examined long years of newspaper files downtown, 3
and worked feverishly at the cryptogram in that leather volume from the 3
cobwebbed vestry room. The cipher, he soon saw, was no simple one; and after a 3
long period of endeavour he felt sure that its language could not be English, 3
Latin, Greek, French, Spanish, Italian, or German. Evidently he would have to 3
draw upon the deepest wells of his strange erudition. 3
3
Every evening the old impulse to gaze westwards returned, and he saw the black 3
steeple as of yore amongst the bristling roofs of a distant and half-fabulous 3
world. But now it held a fresh note of terror for him. He knew the heritage of evil 3
lore it masked, and with the knowledge his vision ran riot in queer new ways. 3
The birds of spring were returning, and as he watched their sunset flights he 3
fancied they avoided the gaunt, lone spire as never before. When a flock of them 3
approached it, he thought, they would wheel and scatter in panic confusion- and 3
he could guess at the wild twitterings which failed to reach him across the 3
intervening miles. 3
3
It was in June that Blake's diary told of his victory over the cryptogram. The text 3
was, he found, in the dark Aklo language used by certain cults of evil antiquity, 3
and known to him in a halting way through previous researches. The diary is 3
strangely reticent about what Blake deciphered, but he was patently awed and 3
disconcerted by his results. There are references to a Haunter of the Dark awaked 3
by gazing into the Shining Trapezohedron, and insane conjectures about the 3
black gulfs of chaos from which it was called. The being is spoken of as holding 3
all knowledge, and demanding monstrous sacrifices. Some of Blake's entries 3
show fear lest the thing, which he seemed to regard as summoned, stalk abroad; 3
though he adds that the streetlights form a bulwark which cannot be crossed. 3
3
Of the Shining Trapezohedron he speaks often, calling it a window on all time 3
and space, and tracing its history from the days it was fashioned on dark 3
Yuggoth, before ever the Old Ones brought it to earth. It was treasured and 3
placed in its curious box by the crinoid things of Antarctica, salvaged from their 3
ruins by the serpent-men of Valusia, and peered at aeons later in Lemuria by the 3
first human beings. It crossed strange lands and stranger seas, and sank with 3
Atlantis before a Minoan fisher meshed it in his net and sold it to swarthy 3
merchants from nighted Khem. The Pharaoh Nephren-Ka built around it a 3
temple with a windowless crypt, and did that which caused his name to be 3
3
3
3
bn 3
3
3
3
stricken from all monuments and records. Then it slept in the ruins of that evil 3
fane which the priests and the new Pharaoh destroyed, till the delver's spade 3
once more brought it forth to curse mankind. 3
3
Early in July the newspapers oddly supplement Blake's entries, though in so 3
brief and casual a way that only the diary has called general attention to their 3
contribution. It appears that a new fear had been growing on Federal Hill since a 3
stranger had entered the dreaded church. The Italians whispered of 3
unaccustomed stirrings and bumpings and scrapings in the dark windowless 3
steeple, and called on their priests to banish an entity which haunted their 3
dreams. Something, they said, was constantly watching at a door to see if it were 3
dark enough to venture forth. Press items mentioned the longstanding local 3
superstitions, but failed to shed much light on the earlier background of the 3
horror. It was obvious that the young reporters of today are no antiquarians. In 3
writing of these things in his diary, Blake expresses a curious kind of remorse, 3
and talks of the duty of burying the Shining Trapezohedron and of banishing 3
what he had evoked by letting daylight into the hideous jutting spire. At the 3
same time, however, he displays the dangerous extent of his fascination, and 3
admits a morbid longing- pervading even his dreams- to visit the accursed tower 3
and gaze again into the cosmic secrets of the glowing stone. 3
3
Then something in the Journal on the morning of 17 July threw the diarist into a 3
veritable fever of horror. It was only a variant of the other half-humorous items 3
about the Federal hill restlessness, but to Blake it was somehow very terrible 3
indeed. In the night a thunderstorm had put the city's lighting-system out of 3
commission for a full hour, and in that black interval the Italians had nearly gone 3
mad with fright. Those living near the dreaded church had sworn that the thing 3
in the steeple had taken advantage of the street lamps' absence and gone down 3
into the body of the church, flopping and bumping around in a viscous, 3
altogether dreadful way. Towards the last it had bumped up to the tower, where 3
there were sounds of the shattering of glass. It could go wherever the darkness 3
reached, but light would always send it fleeing. 3
3
When the current blazed on again there had been a shocking commotion in the 3
tower, for even the feeble light trickling through the grime-blackened, louvre- 3
boarded windows was too much for the thing. It had bumped and slithered up 3
into its tenebrous steeple just in time- for a long dose of light would have sent it 3
back into the abyss whence the crazy stranger had called it. During the dark hour 3
praying crowds had clustered round the church in the rain with lighted candles 3
and lamps somehow shielded with folded paper and umbrellas- a guard of light 3
to save the city from the nightmare that stalks in darkness. Once, those nearest 3
the church declared, the outer door had rattled hideously. 3
3
3
3
578 3
3
3
3
But even this was not the worst. That evening in the Bulletin Blake read of what 3
the reporters had found. Aroused at last to the whimsical news value of the 3
scare, a pair of them had defied the frantic crowds of Italians and crawled into 3
the church through the cellar window after trying the doors in vain. They found 3
the dust of the vestibule and of the spectral nave ploughed up in a singular way, 3
with pits of rotted cushions and satin pew-linings scattered curiously around. 3
There was a bad odour everywhere, and here and there were bits of yellow stain 3
and patches of what looked like charring. Opening the door to the tower, and 3
pausing a moment at the suspicion of a scraping sound above, they found the 3
narrow spiral stairs wiped roughly clean. 3
3
In the tower itself a similarly half-swept condition existed. They spoke of the 3
heptagonal stone pillar, the overturned Gothic chairs, and the bizarre plaster 3
images; though strangely enough the metal box and the old mutilated skeleton 3
were not mentioned. What disturbed Blake the most- except for the hints of 3
stains and charring and bad odours- was the final detail that explained the 3
crashing glass. Every one of the tower's lancet windows was broken, and two of 3
them had been darkened in a crude and hurried way by the stuffing of satin 3
pew-linings and cushion-horsehair into the spaces between the slanting exterior 3
louvre-boards. More satin fragments and bunches of horsehair lay scattered 3
around the newly swept floor, as if someone had been interrupted in the act of 3
restoring the tower to the absolute blackness of its tightly curtained days. 3
3
Yellowish stains and charred patches were found on the ladder to the 3
windowless spire, but when a reporter climbed up, opened the horizontally- 3
sliding trap-door and shot a feeble flashlight beam into the black and strangely 3
foetid space, he saw nothing but darkness, and a heterogeneous litter of 3
shapeless fragments near the aperture. The verdict, of course, was charlatanry. 3
Somebody had played a joke on the superstitious hill-dwellers, or else some 3
fanatic had striven to bolster up their fears for their own supposed good. Or 3
perhaps some of the younger and more sophisticated dwellers had staged an 3
elaborate hoax on the outside world. There was an amusing aftermath when the 3
police sent an officer to verify the reports. Three men in succession found ways 3
of evading the assignment, and the fourth went very reluctantly and returned 3
very soon without adding to the account given by the reporters. 3
3
From this point onwards Blake's diary shows a mounting tide of insidious horror 3
and nervous apprehension. He upbraids himself for not doing something, and 3
speculates wildly on the consequences of another electrical breakdown. It had 3
been verified that on three occasions- during thunderstorms- he telephoned the 3
electric light company in a frantic vein and asked that desperate precautions 3
against a lapse of power be taken. Now and then his entries show concern over 3
the failure of the reporters to find the metal box and stone, and the strangely 3
3
3
3
579 3
3
3
3
marred old skeleton, when they explored the shadowy tower room. He assumed 3
that these things had been removed- whither, and by whom or what, he could 3
only guess. But his worst fears concerned himself, and the kind of unholy 3
rapport he felt to exist between his mind and that lurking horror in the distant 3
steeple- that monstrous thing of night which his rashness had called out of the 3
ultimate black spaces. He seemed to feel a constant tugging at his will, and 3
callers of that period remember how he would sit abstractedly at his desk and 3
stare out of the west window at that far-off spire-bristling mound beyond the 3
swirling smoke of the city. His entries dwell monotonously on certain terrible 3
dreams, and of a strengthening of the unholy rapport in his sleep. There is 3
mention of a night when he awakened to find himself fully dressed, outdoors, 3
and headed automatically down College Hill towards the west. Again and again 3
he dwells on the fact that the thing in the steeple knows where to find him. 3
3
The week following 30 July is recalled as the time of Blake's partial breakdown. 3
He did not dress, and ordered all his food by telephone. Visitors remarked the 3
cords he kept near his bed, and he said that sleep-walking had forced him to 3
bind his ankles every night with knots which would probably hold or else waken 3
him with the labour of untying. In his diary he told of the hideous experience 3
which had brought the collapse. After retiring on the night of the 30th, he had 3
suddenly found himself groping about in an almost black space. All he could see 3
were short, faint, horizontal streaks of bluish light, but he could smell an 3
overpowering foetor and hear a curious jumble of soft, furtive sounds above him. 3
Whenever he moved he stumbled over something, and at each noise there would 3
come a sort of answering sound from above- a vague stirring, mixed with the 3
cautious sliding of wood on wood. 3
3
Once his groping hands encountered a pillar of stone with a vacant top, whilst 3
later he found himself clutching the rungs of a ladder built into the wall, and 3
fumbling his uncertain way upwards towards some region of intenser stench 3
where a hot, searing blast beat down against him. Before his eyes a kaleidoscopic 3
range of phantasmal images played, all of them dissolving at intervals into the 3
picture of a vast, unplumbed abyss of night wherein whirled suns and worlds of 3
an even profounder blackness. He thought of the ancient legends of Ultimate 3
Chaos, at whose centre sprawls the blind idiot god Azathoth, Lord of All Things, 3
encircled by his flopping horde of mindless and amorphous dancers, and lulled 3
by the thin monotonous piping of a demoniac flute held in nameless paws. 3
3
Then a sharp report from the outer world broke through his stupor and roused 3
him to the unutterable horror of his position. What it was, he never knew- 3
perhaps it was some belated peal from the fireworks heard all summer on 3
Federal Hill as the dwellers hail their various patron saints, or the saints of their 3
native villages in Italy. In any event he shrieked aloud, dropped frantically from 3
3
3
3
580 3
3
3
3
the ladder, and stumbled blindly across the obstructed floor of the almost 3
lightless chamber that encompassed him. 3
3
He knew instantly where he was, and plunged recklessly down the narrow spiral 3
staircase, tripping and bruising himself at every turn. There was a nightmare 3
flight through a vast cobw ebbed nave whose ghostly arches readied up to realms 3
of leering shadow, a sightless scramble through a littered basement, a climb to 3
regions of air and street lights outside, and a mad racing down a spectral hill of 3
gibbering gables, across a grim, silent city of tall black towers, and up the steep 3
eastward precipice to his own ancient door. 3
3
On regaining consciousness in the morning he found himself lying on his study 3
floor fully dressed. Dirt and cobwebs covered him, and every inch of his body 3
seemed sore and bruised. When he faced the mirror he saw that his hair was 3
badly scorched while a trace of strange evil odour seemed to cling to his upper 3
outer clothing. It was then that his nerves broke down. Thereafter, lounging 3
exhaustedly about in a dressing-gown, he did little but stare from his west 3
window, shiver at the threat of thunder, and make wild entries in his diary. 3
3
The great storm broke just before midnight on 8 August. Lightning struck 3
repeatedly in all parts of the city, and two remarkable fireballs were reported. 3
The rain was torrential, while a constant fusillade of thunder brought 3
sleeplessness to thousands. Blake was utterly frantic in his fear for the lighting 3
system, and tried to telephone the company around 1 A.M. though by that time 3
service had been temporarily cut off in the interests of safety. He recorded 3
everything in his diary- the large, nervous, and often undecipherable, 3
hieroglyphs telling their own story of growing frenzy and despair, and of entries 3
scrawled blindly in the dark. 3
3
He had to keep the house dark in order to see out of the window, and it appears 3
that most of his time was spent at his desk, peering anxiously through the rain 3
across the glistening miles of downtown roofs at the constellation of distant 3
lights marking Federal Hill. Now and then he would fumblingly make an entry 3
in his diary, so that detached phrases such as "The lights must not go"; "It knows 3
where I am"; "I must destroy it"; and "it is calling to me, but perhaps it means no 3
injury this time"; are found scattered down two of the pages. 3
3
Then the lights went out all over the city. It happened at 2.12 A.M. according to 3
power-house records, but Blake's diary gives no indication of the time. The entry 3
is merely, "Lights out- God help me." On Federal Hill there were watchers as 3
anxious as he, and rain-soaked knots of men paraded the square and alleys 3
around the evil church with umbrella-shaded candles, electric flashlights, oil 3
lanterns, crucifixes, and obscure charms of the many sorts common to southern 3
3
3
3
581 3
3
3
3
Italy. They blessed each flash of lightning, and made cryptical signs of fear with 3
their right hands when a turn in the storm caused the flashes to lessen and finally 3
to cease altogether. A rising wind blew out most of the candles, so that the scene 3
grew threatening dark. Someone roused Father Merluzzo of Spirito Santo 3
Church, and he hastened to the dismal square to pronounce whatever helpful 3
syllables he could. Of the restless and curious sounds in the blackened tower, 3
there could be no doubt whatever. 3
3
For what happened at 2.35 we have the testimony of the priest, a young, 3
intelligent, and well-educated person; of Patrolman William J. Monohan of the 3
Central Station, an officer of the highest reliability who had paused at that part of 3
his beat to inspect the crowd; and of most of the seventy-eight men who had 3
gathered around the church's high bank wall- especially those in the square 3
where the eastward fagade was visible. Of course there was nothing which can 3
be proved as being outside the order of Nature. The possible causes of such an 3
event are many. No one can speak with certainty of the obscure chemical 3
processes arising in a vast, ancient, ill-aired, and long-deserted building of 3
heterogeneous contents. Mephitic vapours- spontaneous combustion- pressure of 3
gases born of long decay- any one of numberless phenomena might be 3
responsible. And then, of course, the factor of conscious charlatanry can by no 3
means be excluded. The thing was really quite simple in itself, and covered less 3
than three minutes of actual time. Father Merluzzo, always a precise man, looked 3
at his watch repeatedly. 3
3
It started with a definite swelling of the dull fumbling sounds inside the black 3
tower. There had for some time been a vague exhalation of strange, evil odours 3
from the church, and this had now become emphatic and offensive. Then at last 3
there was a sound of splintering wood and a large, heavy object crashed down in 3
the yard beneath the frowning easterly fagade. The tower was invisible now that 3
the candles would not burn, but as the object neared the ground the people knew 3
that it was the smoke-grimed louvre-boarding of that tower's east window. 3
3
Immediately afterwards an utterly unbearable foetor welled forth from the 3
unseen heights, choking and sickening the trembling watchers, and almost 3
prostrating those in the square. At the same time the air trembled with a 3
vibration as of flapping wings, and a sudden east-blowing wind more violent 3
than any previous blast snatched off the hats and wrenched the dripping 3
umbrellas from the crowd. Nothing definite could be seen in the candleless 3
night, though some upward-looking spectators thought they glimpsed a great 3
spreading blur of denser blackness against the inky sky- something like a 3
formless cloud of smoke that shot with meteorlike speed towards the east. 3
3

3
That was all. The watchers were half numbed with fright, awe, and discomfort, 3
and scarcely knew what to do, or whether to do anything at all. Not knowing 3
what had happened, they did not relax their vigil; and a moment later they sent 3
up a prayer as a sharp flash of belated lightning, followed by an earsplitting 3
crash of sound, rent the flooded heavens. Half an hour later the rain stopped, 3
and in fifteen minutes more the street lights sprang on again, sending the weary, 3
bedraggled watchers relievedly back to their homes. 3
3
The next day's papers gave these matters minor mention in connection with the 3
general storm reports. It seems that the great lightning flash and deafening 3
explosion which followed the Federal Hill occurrence were even more 3
tremendous farther east, where a burst of the singular foetor was likewise 3
noticed. The phenomenon was most marked over College Hill, where the crash 3
awakened all the sleeping inhabitants and led to a bewildered round of 3
speculations. Of those who were already awake only a few saw the anomalous 3
blaze of light near the top of the hill, or noticed the inexplicable upward rush of 3
air which almost stripped the leaves from the trees and blasted the plants in the 3
gardens. It was agreed that the lone, sudden lightning-bolt must have struck 3
somewhere in this neighbourhood, though no trace of its striking could 3
afterwards be found. A youth in the Tau Omega fraternity house thought he saw 3
a grotesque and hideous mass of smoke in the air just as the preliminary flash 3
burst, but his observation has not been verified. All of the few observers, 3
however, agree as to the violent gust from the west and the flood of intolerable 3
stench which preceded the belated stroke, whilst evidence concerning the 3
momentary burned odour after the stroke is equally general. 3
3
These points were discussed very carefully because of their probable connection 3
with the death of Robert Blake. Students in the Psi Delta house, whose upper rear 3
windows looked into Blake's study, noticed the blurred white face at the 3
westward window on the morning of the ninth, and wondered what was wrong 3
with the expression. When they saw the same face in the same position that 3
evening, they felt worried, and watched for the lights to come up in his 3
apartment. Later they rang the bell of the darkened flat, and finally had a 3
policeman force the door. 3
3
The rigid body sat bolt upright at the desk by the window, and when the 3
intruders saw the glassy, bulging eyes, and the marks of stark, convulsive fright 3
on the twisted features, they turned away in sickened dismay. Shortly afterwards 3
the coroner's physician made an examination, and despite the unbroken window 3
reported electrical shock, or nervous tension induced by electrical discharge, as 3
the cause of death. The hideous expression he ignored altogether, deeming it a 3
not improbable result of the profound shock as experienced by a person of such 3
abnormal imagination and unbalanced emotions. He deduced these latter 3
3
3
3
583 3
3
3
3
qualities from the books, paintings, and manuscripts found in the apartment, and 3
from the bhndly scrawled entries in the diary on the desk. Blake had prolonged 3
his frenzied jottings to the last, and the broken-pointed pencil was found 3
clutched in his spasmodically contracted right hand. 3
3
The entries after the failure of the lights were highly disjointed, and legible only 3
in part. From them certain investigators have drawn conclusions differing 3
greatly from the materialistic official verdict, but such speculations have little 3
chance for belief among the conservative. The case of these imaginative theorists 3
has not been helped by the action of superstitious Doctor Dexter, who threw the 3
curious box and angled stone- an object certainly self-luminous as seen in the 3
black windowless steeple where it was found- into the deepest channel of 3
Narragansett Bay. Excessive imagination and neurotic unbalance on Blake's part, 3
aggravated by knowledge of the evil bygone cult whose startling traces he had 3
uncovered, form the dominant interpretation given those final frenzied jottings. 3
These are the entries- or all that can be made of them: 3
3
Lights still out- must be five minutes now. Everything depends on lightning. 3
Yaddith grant it will keep up!... Some influence seems beating through it... Rain 3
and thunder and wind deafen. . . The thing is taking hold of my mind. . . 3
3
Trouble with memory. I see things I never knew before. Other worlds and other 3
galaxies. . . Dark. . . The lightning seems dark and the darkness seems light. . . 3
3
It cannot be the real hill and church that I see in the pitch-darkness. Must be 3
retinal impression left by flashes. Heaven grant the Italians are out with their 3
candles if the lightning stops! 3
3
What am I afraid of? Is it not an avatar of Nyarlathotep, who in antique and 3
shadowy Khem even took the form of man? I remember Yuggoth, and more 3
distant Shaggai, and the ultimate void of the black planets. . . 3
3
The long, winging flight through the void. . . cannot cross the universe of light . . . 3
re-created by the thoughts caught in the Shining Trapezohedron. . . send it 3
through the horrible abysses of radiance. . . 3
3
My name is Blake- Robert Harrison Blake of 620 East Knapp Street, Milwaukee, 3
Wisconsin. . . I am on this planet. . . 3
3
Azathoth have mercy!- the lightning no longer flashes- horrible- I can see 3
everything with a monstrous sense that is not sight- light is dark and dark is 3
light. . . those people on the hill. . . guard. . . candles and charms. . . their priests. . . 3

3
Not many weeks ago, on a street corner in the village of Pascoag, Rhode Island, a 3
tall, heavily built, and wholesome-looking pedestrian furnished much 3
speculation by a singular lapse of behaviour. He had, it appears, been 3
descending the hill by the road from Chepachet; and encountering the compact 3
section, had turned to his left into the main thoroughfare where several modest 3
business blocks convey a touch of the urban. At this point, without visible 3
provocation, he committed his astonishing lapse; staring queerly for a second at 3
the tallest of the buildings before him, and then, with a series of terrified, 3
hysterical shrieks, breaking into a frantic run which ended in a stumble and fall 3
at the next crossing. Picked up and dusted off by ready hands, he was found to 3
be conscious, organically unhurt, and evidently cured of his sudden nervous 3
attack. He muttered some shamefaced explanations involving a strain he had 3
undergone, and with downcast glance turned back up the Chepachet road, 3
trudging out of sight without once looking behind him. It was a strange incident 3
to befall so large, robust, normal-featured, and capable-looking a man, and the 3
strangeness was not lessened by the remarks of a bystander who had recognised 3
him as the boarder of a well-known dairyman on the outskirts of Chepachet. 3
3
He was, it developed, a New York police detective named Thomas F. Malone, 3
now on a long leave of absence under medical treatment after some 3
disproportionately arduous work on a gruesome local case which accident had 3
made dramatic. There had been a collapse of several old brick buildings during a 3
raid in which he had shared, and something about the wholesale loss of life, both 3
of prisoners and of his companions, had peculiarly appalled him. As a result, he 3
had acquired an acute and anomalous horror of any buildings even remotely 3
suggesting the ones which had fallen in, so that in the end mental specialists 3
forbade him the sight of such things for an indefinite period. A police surgeon 3
with relatives in Chepachet had put forward that quaint hamlet of wooden 3
colonial houses as an ideal spot for the psychological convalescence; and thither 3
the sufferer had gone, promising never to venture among the brick-lined streets 3
of larger villages till duly advised by the Woonsocket specialist with whom he 3
was put in touch. This walk to Pascoag for magazines had been a mistake, and 3
the patient had paid in fright, bruises, and humiliation for his disobedience. 3
3
3
3
586 3
3
3
3
So much the gossips of Chepachet and Pascoag knew; and so much, also, the 3
most learned specialists believed. But Malone had at first told the specialists 3
much more, ceasing only when he saw that utter incredulity was his portion. 3
Thereafter he held his peace, protesting not at all when it was generally agreed 3
that the collapse of certain squalid brick houses in the Red Hook section of 3
Brooklyn, and the consequent death of many brave officers, had unseated his 3
nervous equilibrium. He had worked too hard, all said, it trying to clean up those 3
nests of disorder and violence; certain features were shocking enough, in all 3
conscience, and the unexpected tragedy was the last straw. This was a simple 3
explanation which everyone could understand, and because Malone was not a 3
simple person he perceived that he had better let it suffice. To hint to 3
unimaginative people of a horror beyond all human conception - a horror of 3
houses and blocks and cities leprous and cancerous with evil dragged from elder 3
worlds - would be merely to invite a padded cell instead of a restful rustication, 3
and Malone was a man of sense despite his mysticism. He had the Celt's far 3
vision of weird and hidden things, but the logician's quick eye for the outwardly 3
unconvincing; an amalgam which had led him far afield in the forty-two years of 3
his life, and set him in strange places for a Dublin University man born in a 3
Georgian villa near Phoenix Park. 3
3
And now, as he reviewed the things he had seen and felt and apprehended, 3
Malone was content to keep unshared the secret of what could reduce a 3
dauntless fighter to a quivering neurotic; what could make old brick slums and 3
seas of dark, subtle faces a thing of nightmare and eldritch portent. It would not 3
be the first time his sensations had been forced to bide uninterpreted - for was 3
not his very act of plunging into the polyglot abyss of New York's underworld a 3
freak beyond sensible explanation? What could he tell the prosaic of the antique 3
witcheries and grotesque marvels discernible to sensitive eyes amidst the poison 3
cauldron where all the varied dregs of unwholesome ages mix their venom and 3
perpetuate their obscene terrors? He had seen the hellish green flame of secret 3
wonder in this blatant, evasive welter of outward greed and inward blasphemy, 3
and had smiled gently when all the New-Yorkers he knew scoffed at his 3
experiment in police work. They had been very witty and cynical, deriding his 3
fantastic pursuit of unknowable mysteries and assuring him that in these days 3
New York held nothing but cheapness and vulgarity. One of them had wagered 3
him a heavy sum that he could not - despite many poignant things to his credit in 3
the Dublin Review - even write a truly interesting story of New York low life; 3
and now, looking back, he perceived that cosmic irony had justified the 3
prophet's words while secretly confuting their flippant meaning. The horror, as 3
glimpsed at last, could not make a story - for like the book cited by Poe's 3
Germany authority, 'es lasst sich nicht lesen - it does not permit itself to be read.' 3

To Malone the sense of latent mystery in existence was always present. In youth 3
he had felt the hidden beauty and ecstasy of things, and had been a poet; but 3
poverty and sorrow and exile had turned his gaze in darker directions, and he 3
had thrilled at the imputations of evil in the world around. Daily life had fur him 3
come to be a phantasmagoria of macabre shadow-studies; now glittering and 3
leering with concealed rottenness as in Beardsley's best manner, now hinting 3
terrors behind the commonest shapes and objects as in the subtler and less 3
obvious work of Gustave Dore. He would often regard it as merciful that most 3
persons of high Intelligence jeer at the inmost mysteries; for, he argued, if 3
superior minds were ever placed in fullest contact with the secrets preserved by 3
ancient and lowly cults, the resultant abnormalities would soon not only wreck 3
the world, but threaten the very integrity of the universe. All this reflection was 3
no doubt morbid, but keen logic and a deep sense of humour ably offset it. 3
Malone was satisfied to let his notions remain as half-spied and forbidden 3
visions to be lightly played with; and hysteria came only when duty flung him 3
into a hell of revelation too sudden and insidious to escape. 3
3
He had for some time been detailed to the Butler Street station in Brooklyn when 3
the Red Hook matter came to his notice. Red Hook is a maze of hybrid squalor 3
near the ancient waterfront opposite Governor's Island, with dirty highways 3
climbing the hill from the wharves to that higher ground where the decayed 3
lengths of Clinton and Court Streets lead off toward the Borough Hall. Its houses 3
are mostly of brick, dating from the first quarter to the middle of the nineteenth 3
century, and some of the obscurer alleys and byways have that alluring antique 3
flavour which conventional reading leads us to call 'Dickensian'. The population 3
is a hopeless tangle and enigma; Syrian, Spanish, Italian, and Negro elements 3
impinging upon one another, and fragments of Scandinavian and American belts 3
lying not far distant. It is a babel of sound and filth, and sends out strange cries 3
to answer the lapping oily waves at its grimy piers and the monstrous organ 3
litanies of the harbour whistles. Here long ago a brighter picture dwelt, with 3
clear-eyed mariners on the lower streets and homes of taste and substance where 3
the larger houses line the hill. One can trace the relics of this former happiness in 3
the trim shapes of the buildings, the occasional graceful churches, and the 3
evidences of original art and background in bits of detail here and there - a worn 3
flight of steps, a battered doorway, a wormy pair of decorative columns or 3
pilasters, or a fragment of once green space with bent and rusted iron railing. The 3
houses are generally in solid blocks, and now and then a many-windowed 3
cupola arises to tell of days when the households of captains and ship-owners 3
watched the sea. 3
3
From this tangle of material and spiritual putrescence the blasphemies of an 3
hundred dialects assail the sky. Hordes of prowlers reel shouting and singing 3
along the lanes and thoroughfares, occasional furtive hands suddenly extinguish 3
3
3
3
588 3
3
3
3
lights and pull down curtains, and swarthy, sin-pitted faces disappear from 3
windows when visitors pick their way through. Policemen despair of order or 3
reform, and seek rather to erect barriers protecting the outside world from the 3
contagion. The clang of the patrol is answered by a kind of spectral silence, and 3
such prisoners as are taken are never communicative. Visible offences are as 3
varied as the local dialects, and run the gamut from the smuggling of rum and 3
prohibited aliens through diverse stages of lawlessness and obscure vice to 3
murder and mutilation in their most abhorrent guises. That these visible affairs 3
are not more frequent is not to the neighbourhood's credit, unless the power of 3
concealment be an art demanding credit. More people enter Red Hook than leave 3
it - or at least, than leave it by the landward side - and those who are not 3
loquacious are the likeliest to leave. 3
3
Malone found in this state of things a faint stench of secrets more terrible than 3
any of the sins denounced by citizens and bemoaned by priests and 3
philanthropists. He was conscious, as one who united imagination with scientific 3
knowledge, that modern people under lawless conditions tend uncannily to 3
repeat the darkest instinctive patterns of primitive half- ape savagery in their 3
daily life and ritual observances; and he had often viewed with an 3
anthropologist's shudder the chanting, cursing processions of blear-eyed and 3
pockmarked young men which wound their way along in the dark small hours 3
of morning. One saw groups of these youths incessantly; sometimes in leering 3
vigils on street corners, sometimes in doorways playing eerily on cheap 3
instruments of music, sometimes in stupefied dozes or indecent dialogues 3
around cafeteria tables near Borough Hall, and sometimes in whispering 3
converse around dingy taxicabs drawn up at the high stoops of crumbling and 3
closely shuttered old houses. They chilled and fascinated him more than he 3
dared confess to his associates on the force, for he seemed to see in them some 3
monstrous thread of secret continuity; some fiendish, cryptical, and ancient 3
pattern utterly beyond and below the sordid mass of facts and habits and haunts 3
listed with such conscientious technical care by the police. They must be, he felt 3
inwardly, the heirs of some shocking and primordial tradition; the sharers of 3
debased and broken scraps from cults and ceremonies older than mankind. Their 3
coherence and definiteness suggested it, and it shewed in the singular suspicion 3
of order which lurked beneath their squalid disorder. He had not read in vain 3
such treatises as Miss Murray's Witch-Cult in Western Europe; and knew that up 3
to recent years there had certainly survived among peasants and furtive folk a 3
frightful and clandestine system of assemblies and orgies descended from dark 3
religions antedating the Aryan world, and appearing in popular legends as Black 3
Masses and Witches' Sabbaths. That these hellish vestiges of old Turanian- 3
Asiatic magic and fertility cults were even now wholly dead he could not for a 3
moment suppose, and he frequently wondered how much older and how much 3
blacker than the very worst of the muttered tales some of them might really be. 3

Ill 3
3
It was the case of Robert Suydam which took Malone to the heart of things in 3
Red Hook. Suydam was a lettered recluse of ancient Dutch family, possessed 3
originally of barely independent means, and inhabiting the spacious but ill- 3
preserved mansion which his grandfather had built in Flatbush when that village 3
was little more than a pleasant group of colonial cottages surrounding the 3
steepled and ivy-clad Reformed Church with its iron-railed yard of 3
Netherlandish gravestones. In his lonely house, set back from Martense Street 3
amidst a yard of venerable trees, Suydam had read and brooded for some six 3
decades except for a period a generation before, when he had sailed for the old 3
world and remained there out of sight for eight years. He could afford no 3
servants, and would admit but few visitors to his absolute solitude; eschewing 3
close friendships and receiving his rare acquaintances in one of the three ground- 3
floor rooms which he kept in order - a vast, high-ceiled library whose walls were 3
solidly packed with tattered books of ponderous, archaic, and vaguely repellent 3
aspect. The growth of the town and its final absorption in the Brooklyn district 3
had meant nothing to Suydam, and he had come to mean less and less to the 3
town. Elderly people still pointed him out on the streets, but to most of the recent 3
population he was merely a queer, corpulent old fellow whose unkempt white 3
hair, stubbly beard, shiny black clothes, and gold-headed cane earned him an 3
amused glance and nothing more. Malone did not know him by sight till duty 3
called him to the case, but had heard of him indirectly as a really profound 3
authority on mediaeval superstition, and had once idly meant to look up an out- 3
of-print pamphlet of his on the Kabbalah and the Faustus legend, which a friend 3
had quoted from memory. 3
3
Suydam became a case when his distant and only relatives sought court 3
pronouncements on his sanity. Their action seemed sudden to the outside world, 3
but was really undertaken only after prolonged observation and sorrowful 3
debate. It was based on certain odd changes in his speech and habits; wild 3
references to impending wonders, and unaccountable hauntings of disreputable 3
Brooklyn neighbourhoods. He had been growing shabbier and shabbier with the 3
years, and now prowled about like a veritable mendicant; seen occasionally by 3
humiliated friends in subway stations, or loitering on the benches around 3
Borough Hall in conversation with groups of swarthy, evil-looking strangers. 3
When he spoke it was to babble of unlimited powers almost within his grasp, 3
and to repeat with knowing leers such mystical words or names as 'Sephiroth', 3
'Ashmodai', and 'Samael'. The court action revealed that he was using up his 3
income and wasting his principal in the purchase of curious tomes imported 3
from London and Paris, and in the maintenance of a squalid basement flat in the 3
Red Hook district where he spent nearly every night, receiving odd delegations 3
of mixed rowdies and foreigners, and apparently conducting some kind of 3
3
3
3
590 3
3
3
3
ceremonial service behind the green bHnds of secretive windows. Detectives 3
assigned to follow him reported strange cries and chants and prancing of feet 3
filtering out from these nocturnal rites, and shuddered at their peculiar ecstasy 3
and abandon despite the commonness of weird orgies in that sodden section. 3
When, however, the matter came to a hearing, Suydam managed to preserve his 3
liberty. Before the judge his manner grew urbane and reasonable, and he freely 3
admitted the queerness of demeanour and extravagant cast of language into 3
which he had fallen through excessive devotion to study and research. He was, 3
he said, engaged in the investigation of certain details of European tradition 3
which required the closest contact with foreign groups and their songs and folk 3
dances. The notion that any low secret society was preying upon him, as hinted 3
by his relatives, was obviously absurd; and shewed how sadly limited was their 3
understanding of him and his work. Triumphing with his calm explanations, he 3
was suffered to depart unhindered; and the paid detectives of the Suydams, 3
Corlears, and Van Brunts were withdrawn in resigned disgust. 3
3
It was here that an alliance of Federal inspectors and police, Malone with them, 3
entered the case. The law had watched the Suydam action with interest, and had 3
in many instances been called upon to aid the private detectives. In this work it 3
developed that Suydam's new associates were among the blackest and most 3
vicious criminals of Red Hook's devious lanes, and that at least a third of them 3
were known and repeated offenders in the matter of thievery, disorder, and the 3
importation of illegal immigrants. Indeed, it would not have been too much to 3
say that the old scholar's particular circle coincided almost perfectly with the 3
worst of the organized cliques which smuggled ashore certain nameless and 3
unclassified Asian dregs wisely turned back by Ellis Island. In the teeming 3
rookeries of Parker Place - since renamed - where Suydam had his basement flat, 3
there had grown up a very unusual colony of unclassified slant-eyed folk who 3
used the Arabic alphabet but were eloquently repudiated by the great mass of 3
Syrians in and around Atlantic Avenue. They could all have been deported for 3
lack of credentials, but legalism is slow-moving, and one does not disturb Red 3
Hook unless publicity forces one to. 3
3
These creatures attended a tumbledown stone church, used Wednesdays as a 3
dance-hall, which reared its Gothic buttresses near the vilest part of the 3
waterfront. It was nominally Catholic; but priests throughout Brooklyn denied 3
the place all standing and authenticity, and policemen agreed with them when 3
they listened to the noises it emitted at night. Malone used to fancy he heard 3
terrible cracked bass notes from a hidden organ far underground when the 3
church stood empty and unlighted, whilst all observers dreaded the shrieking 3
and drumming which accompanied the visible services. Suydam, when 3
questioned, said he thought the ritual was some remnant of Nestorian 3
Christianity tinctured with the Shamanism of Thibet. Most of the people, he 3
3
3
3
591 3
3
3
3
conjectured, were of Mongoloid stock, originating somewhere in or near 3
Kurdistan - and Malone could not help recalling that Kurdistan is the land of the 3
Yezidis, last survivors of the Persian devil-worshippers. However this may have 3
been, the stir of the Suydam investigation made it certain that these unauthorised 3
newcomers were flooding Red Hook in increasing numbers; entering through 3
some marine conspiracy unreached by revenue officers and harbour police, 3
overrunning Parker Place and rapidly spreading up the hill, and welcomed with 3
curious fraternalism by the other assorted denizens of the region. Their squat 3
figures and characteristic squinting physiognomies, grotesquely combined with 3
flashy American clothing, appeared more and more numerously among the 3
loafers and nomad gangsters of the Borough Hall section; till at length it was 3
deemed necessary to compute their numbers, ascertain their sources and 3
occupations, and find if possible a way to round them up and deliver them to the 3
proper immigration authorities. To this task Malone was assigned by agreement 3
of Federal and city forces, and as he commenced his canvass of Red Hook he felt 3
poised upon the brink of nameless terrors, with the shabby, unkempt figure of 3
Robert Suydam as arch-fiend and adversary. 3
3
IV 3
3
Police methods are varied and ingenious. Malone, through unostentatious 3
rambles, carefully casual conversations, well-timed offers of hip-pocket liquor, 3
and judicious dialogues with frightened prisoners, learned many isolated facts 3
about the movement whose aspect had become so menacing. The newcomers 3
were indeed Kurds, but of a dialect obscure and puzzling to exact philology. 3
Such of them as worked lived mostly as dock-hands and unlicenced pedlars, 3
though frequently serving in Greek restaurants and tending corner news stands. 3
Most of them, however, had no visible means of support; and were obviously 3
connected with underworld pursuits, of which smuggling and 'bootlegging' 3
were the least indescribable. They had come in steamships, apparently tramp 3
freighters, and had been unloaded by stealth on moonless nights in rowboats 3
which stole under a certain wharf and followed a hidden canal to a secret 3
subterranean pool beneath a house. This wharf, canal, and house Malone could 3
not locate, for the memories of his informants were exceedingly confused, while 3
their speech was to a great extent beyond even the ablest interpreters; nor could 3
he gain any real data on the reasons for their systematic importation. They were 3
reticent about the exact spot from which they had come, and were never 3
sufficiently off guard to reveal the agencies which had sought them out and 3
directed their course. Indeed, they developed something like acute fright when 3
asked the reasons for their presence. Gangsters of other breeds were equally 3
taciturn, and she most that could be gathered was that some god or great 3
priesthood had promised them unheard-of powers and supernatural glories and 3
rulerships in a strange land. 3
3
3
3
592 3
3
3
3
The attendance of both newcomers and old gangsters at Suydam's closely 3
guarded nocturnal meetings was very regular, and the police soon learned that 3
the erstwhile recluse had leased additional flats to accommodate such guests as 3
knew his password; at last occupying three entire houses and permanently 3
harbouring many of his queer companions. He spent but little time now at his 3
Flatbush home, apparently going and coming only to obtain and return books; 3
and his face and manner had attained an appalling pitch of wildness. Malone 3
twice interviewed him, but was each time brusquely repulsed. He knew nothing, 3
he said, of any mysterious plots or movements; and had no idea how the Kurds 3
could have entered or what they wanted. His business was to study undisturbed 3
the folklore of all the immigrants of the district; a business with which policemen 3
had no legitimate concern. Malone mentioned his admiration for Suydam's old 3
brochure on the Kabbalah and other myths, but the old man's softening was only 3
momentary. He sensed an intrusion, and rebuffed his visitor in no uncertain 3
way; till Malone withdrew disgusted, and turned to other channels of 3
information. 3
3
What Malone would have unearthed could he have worked continuously on the 3
case, we shall never know. As it was, a stupid conflict between city and Federal 3
authority suspended the investigations for several months, during which the 3
detective was busy with other assignments. But at no time did he lose interest, or 3
fail to stand amazed at what began to happen to Robert Suydam. Just at the time 3
when a wave of kidnappings and disappearances spread its excitement over 3
New York, the unkempt scholar embarked upon a metamorphosis as startling as 3
it was absurd. One day he was seen near Borough Hall with clean-shaved face, 3
well-trimmed hair, and tastefully immaculate attire, and on every day thereafter 3
some obscure improvement was noticed in him. He maintained his new 3
fastidiousness without interruption, added to it an unwonted sparkle of eye and 3
crispness of speech, and began little by little to shed the corpulence which had so 3
long deformed him. Now frequently taken for less than his age, he acquired an 3
elasticity of step and buoyancy of demeanour to match the new tradition, and 3
shewed a curious darkening of the hair which somehow did not suggest dye. As 3
the months passed, he commenced to dress less and less conservatively, and 3
finally astonished his new friends by renovating and redecorating his Flatbush 3
mansion, which he threw open in a series of receptions, summoning all the 3
acquaintances he could remember, and extending a special welcome to the fully 3
forgiven relatives who had so lately sought his restraint. Some attended through 3
curiosity, others through duty; but all were suddenly charmed by the dawning 3
grace and urbanity of the former hermit. He had, he asserted, accomplished most 3
of his allotted work; and having just inherited some property from a half- 3
forgotten European friend, was about to spend his remaining years in a brighter 3
second youth which ease, care, and diet had made possible to him. Less and less 3
was he seen at Red Hook, and more and more did he move in the society to 3
3
3
3
593 3
3
3
3
which he was born. PoHcemen noted a tendency of the gangsters to congregate at 3
the old stone church and dance-hall instead of at the basement flat in Parker 3
Place, though the latter and its recent annexes still overflowed with noxious life. 3
3
Then two incidents occurred - wide enough apart, but both of intense interest in 3
the case as Malone envisaged it. One was a quiet announcement in the Eagle of 3
Robert Suydam's engagement to Miss Cornelia Gerritsen of Bayside, a young 3
woman of excellent position, and distantly related to the elderly bridegroom- 3
elect; whilst the other was a raid on the dance-hall church by city police, after a 3
report that the face of a kidnapped child had been seen for a second at one of the 3
basement windows. Malone had participated in this raid, and studied the place 3
with much care when inside. Nothing was found - in fact, the building was 3
entirely deserted when visited - but the sensitive Celt was vaguely disturbed by 3
many things about the interior. There were crudely painted panels he did not 3
like - panels which depicted sacred faces with peculiarly worldly and sardonic 3
expressions, and which occasionally took liberties that even a layman's sense of 3
decorum could scarcely countenance. Then, too, he did not relish the Greek 3
inscription on the wall above the pulpit; an ancient incantation which he had 3
once stumbled upon in Dublin college days, and which read, literally translated, 3
3
'O friend and companion of night, thou who rejoicest in the baying of dogs and 3
spilt blood, who wanderest in the midst of shades among the tombs, who longest 3
for blood and bringest terror to mortals, Gorgo, Mormo, thousand-faced moon, 3
look favourably on our sacrifices!' 3
3
When he read this he shuddered, and thought vaguely of the cracked bass organ 3
notes he fancied he had heard beneath the church on certain nights. He 3
shuddered again at the rust around the rim of a metal basin which stood on the 3
altar, and paused nervously when his nostrils seemed to detect a curious and 3
ghastly stench from somewhere in the neighbourhood. That organ memory 3
haunted him, and he explored the basement with particular assiduity before he 3
left. The place was very hateful to him; yet after all, were the blasphemous panels 3
and inscriptions more than mere crudities perpetrated by the ignorant? 3
3
By the time of Suydam's wedding the kidnapping epidemic had become a 3
popular newspaper scandal. Most of the victims were young children of the 3
lowest classes, but the increasing number of disappearances had worked up a 3
sentiment of the strongest fury. Journals clamoured for action from the police, 3
and once more the Butler Street Station sent its men over Red Hook for clues, 3
discoveries, and criminals. Malone was glad to be on the trail again, and took 3
pride in a raid on one of Suydam's Parker Place houses. There, indeed, no stolen 3
child was found, despite the tales of screams and the red sash picked up in the 3
areaway; but the paintings and rough inscriptions on the peeling walls of most of 3
3
3
3
594 3
3
3
3
the rooms, and the primitive chemical laboratory in the attic, all helped to 3
convince the detective that he was on the track of something tremendous. The 3
paintings were appalling - hideous monsters of every shape and size, and 3
parodies on human outlines which cannot be described. The writing was in red, 3
and varied from Arabic to Greek, Roman, and Hebrew letters. Malone could not 3
read much of it, but what he did decipher was portentous and cabbalistic 3
enough. One frequently repeated motto was in a Sort of Hebraised Hellenistic 3
Greek, and suggested the most terrible daemon-evocations of the Alexandrian 3
decadence: 3
3
'HEL • HELOYM • SOTHER • EMMANVEL • SABAOTH • AGLA • 3
TETRAGRAMMATON • AGYROS • OTHEOS • ISCHYROS • ATHANATOS • 3
lEHOVA • VA • ADONAI • SADAY • HOMOVSION • MESSIAS • 3
ESCHEREHEYE.' 3
3
Circles and pentagrams loomed on every hand, and told indubitably of the 3
strange beliefs and aspirations of those who dwelt so squalidly here. In the cellar, 3
however, the strangest thing was found - a pile of genuine gold ingots covered 3
carelessly with a piece of burlap, and bearing upon their shining surfaces the 3
same weird hieroglyphics which also adorned the walls. During the raid the 3
police encountered only a passive resistance from the squinting Orientals that 3
swarmed from every door. Finding nothing relevant, they had to leave all as it 3
was; but the precinct captain wrote Suydam a note advising him to look closely 3
to the character of his tenants and proteges in view of the growing public 3
clamour. 3
3
V 3
3
Then came the June wedding and the great sensation. Flatbush was gay for the 3
hour about high noon, and pennanted motors thronged the streets near the old 3
Dutch church where an awning stretched from door to highway. No local event 3
ever surpassed the Suydam-Gerritsen nuptials in tone and scale, and the party 3
which escorted bride and groom to the Cunard Pier was, if not exactly the 3
smartest, at least a solid page from the Social Register. At five o'clock adieux 3
were waved, and the ponderous liner edged away from the long pier, slowly 3
turned its nose seaward, discarded its tug, and headed for the widening water 3
spaces that led to old world wonders. By night the outer harbour was cleared, 3
and late passengers watched the stars twinkling above an unpolluted ocean. 3
3
Whether the tramp steamer or the scream was first to gain attention, no one can 3
say. Probably they were simultaneous, but it is of no use to calculate. The scream 3
came from the Suydam stateroom, and the sailor who broke down the door 3
could perhaps have told frightful things if he had not forthwith gone completely 3
3
3
3
595 3
3
3
3
mad - as it is, he shrieked more loudly than the first victims, and thereafter ran 3
simpering about the vessel till caught and put in irons. The ship's doctor who 3
entered the stateroom and turned on the lights a moment later did not go mad, 3
but told nobody what he saw till afterward, when he corresponded with Malone 3
in Chepachet. It was murder - strangulation - but one need not say that the claw- 3
mark on Mrs. Suydam's throat could not have come from her husband's or any 3
other human hand, or that upon the white wall there flickered for an instant in 3
hateful red a legend which, later copied from memory, seems to have been 3
nothing less than the fearsome Chaldee letters of the word 'LILITH'. One need 3
not mention these things because they vanished so quickly - as for Suydam, one 3
could at least bar others from the room until one knew what to think oneself. The 3
doctor has distinctly assured Malone that he did not see IT. The open porthole, 3
just before he turned on the lights, was clouded for a second with a certain 3
phosphorescence, and for a moment there seemed to echo in the night outside 3
the suggestion of a faint and hellish tittering; but no real outline met the eye. As 3
proof, the doctor points to his continued sanity. 3
3
Then the tramp steamer claimed all attention. A boat put off, and a horde of 3
swart, insolent ruffians in officers' dress swarmed aboard the temporarily halted 3
Cunarder. They wanted Suydam or his body - they had known of his trip, and 3
for certain reasons were sure he would die. The captain's deck was almost a 3
pandemonium; for at the instant, between the doctor's report from the stateroom 3
and the demands of the men from the tramp, not even the wisest and gravest 3
seaman could think what to do. Suddenly the leader of the visiting mariners, an 3
Arab with a hatefully negroid mouth, pulled forth a dirty, crumpled paper and 3
handed it to the captain. It was signed by Robert Suydam, and bore the following 3
odd message. 3
3
In case of sudden or unexplained accident or death on my part, please deliver me 3
or my body unquestioningly into the hands of the bearer and his associates. 3
Everything, for me, and perhaps for you, depends on absolute compliance. 3
Explanations can come later - do not fail me now. 3
3
- ROBERT SUYDAM 3
3
Captain and doctor looked at each other, and the latter whispered something to 3
the former. Finally they nodded rather helplessly and led the way to the Suydam 3
stateroom. The doctor directed the captain's glance away as he unlocked the 3
door and admitted the strange seamen, nor did he breathe easily till they filed 3
out with their burden after an unaccountably long period of preparation. It was 3
wrapped in bedding from the berths, and the doctor was glad that the outlines 3
were not very revealing. Somehow the men got the thing over the side and away 3
to their tramp steamer without uncovering it. The Cunarder started again, and 3
3
3
3
596 3
3
3
3
the doctor and a ship's undertaker sought out the Suydam stateroom to perform 3
what last services they could. Once more the physician was forced to reticence 3
and even to mendacity, for a hellish thing had happened. When the undertaker 3
asked him why he had drained off all of Mrs. Suydam's blood, he neglected to 3
affirm that he had not done so; nor did he point to the vacant bottle-spaces on the 3
rack, or to the odour in the sink which shewed the hasty disposition of the 3
bottles' original contents. The pockets of those men - if men they were - had 3
bulged damnably when they left the ship. Two hours later, and the world knew 3
by radio all that it ought to know of the horrible affair. 3
3
VI 3
3
That same June evening, without having heard a word from the sea, Malone was 3
desperately busy among the alleys of Red Hook. A sudden stir seemed to 3
permeate the place, and as if apprised by 'grapevine telegraph' of something 3
singular, the denizens clustered expectantly around the dance-hall church and 3
the houses in Parker Place. Three children had just disappeared - blue-eyed 3
Norwegians from the streets toward Gowanus - and there were rumours of a 3
mob forming among the sturdy Vikings of that section. Malone had for weeks 3
been urging his colleagues to attempt a general cleanup; and at last, moved by 3
conditions more obvious to their common sense than the conjectures of a Dublin 3
dreamer, they had agreed upon a final stroke. The unrest and menace of this 3
evening had been the deciding factor, and just about midnight a raiding party 3
recruited from three stations descended upon Parker Place and its environs. 3
Doors were battered in, stragglers arrested, and candlelighted rooms forced to 3
disgorge unbelievable throngs of mixed foreigners in figured robes, mitres, and 3
other inexplicable devices. Much was lost in the melee, for objects were thrown 3
hastily down unexpected shafts, and betraying odours deadened by the sudden 3
kindling of pungent incense. But spattered blood was everywhere, and Malone 3
shuddered whenever he saw a brazier or altar from which the smoke was still 3
rising. 3
3
He wanted to be in several places at once, and decided on Suydam's basement 3
flat only after a messenger had reported the complete emptiness of the 3
dilapidated dance-hall church. The flat, he thought, must hold some due to a cult 3
of which the occult scholar had so obviously become the centre and leader; and it 3
was with real expectancy that he ransacked the musty rooms, noted their 3
vaguely charnel odour, and examined the curious books, instruments, gold 3
ingots, and glass-stoppered bottles scattered carelessly here and there. Once a 3
lean, black-and-white cat edged between his feet and tripped him, overturning at 3
the same time a beaker half full of a red liquid. The shock was severe, and to this 3
day Malone is not certain of what he saw; but in dreams he still pictures that cat 3
as it scuttled away with certain monstrous alterations and peculiarities. Then 3
3
3
3
597 3
3
3
3
came the locked cellar door, and the search for something to break it down. A 3
heavy stool stood near, and its tough seat was more than enough for the antique 3
panels. A crack formed and enlarged, and the whole door gave way - but from 3
the other side; whence poured a howling tumult of ice-cold wind with all the 3
stenches of the bottomless pit, and whence reached a sucking force not of earth 3
or heaven, which, coiling sentiently about the paralysed detective, dragged him 3
through the aperture and down unmeasured spaces filled with whispers and 3
wails, and gusts of mocking laughter. 3
3
Of course it was a dream. All the specialists have told him so, and he has nothing 3
to prove the contrary. Indeed, he would rather have it thus; for then the sight of 3
old brick slums and dark foreign faces would not eat so deeply into his soul. But 3
at the time it was all horribly real, and nothing can ever efface the memory of 3
those nighted crypts, those titan arcades, and those half-formed shapes of hell 3
that strode gigantically in silence holding half-eaten things whose still surviving 3
portions screamed for mercy or laughed with madness. Odours of incense and 3
corruption joined in sickening concert, and the black air was alive with the 3
cloudy, semi-visible bulk of shapeless elemental things with eyes. Somewhere 3
dark sticky water was lapping at onyx piers, and once the shivery tinkle of 3
raucous little bells pealed out to greet the insane titter of a naked phosphorescent 3
thing which swam into sight, scrambled ashore, and climbed up to squat 3
leeringly on a carved golden pedestal in the background. 3
3
Avenues of limitless night seemed to radiate in every direction, till one might 3
fancy that here lay the root of a contagion destined to sicken and swallow cities, 3
and engulf nations in the foetor of hybrid pestilence. Here cosmic sin had 3
entered, and festered by unhallowed rites had commenced the grinning march of 3
death that was to rot us all to fungous abnormalities too hideous for the grave's 3
holding. Satan here held his Babylonish court, and in the blood of stainless 3
childhood the leprous limbs of phosphorescent Lilith were laved. Incubi and 3
succubae howled praise to Hecate, and headless moon-calves bleated to the 3
Magna Mater. Goats leaped to the sound of thin accursed flutes, and ^gypans 3
chased endlessly after misshapen fauns over rocks twisted like swollen toads. 3
Moloch and Ashtaroth were not absent; for in this quintessence of all damnation 3
the bounds of consciousness were let down, and man's fancy lay open to vistas 3
of every realm of horror and every forbidden dimension that evil had power to 3
mould. The world and Nature were helpless against such assaults from unsealed 3
wells of night, nor could any sign or prayer check the Walpurgis-riot of horror 3
which had come when a sage with the hateful key had stumbled on a horde with 3
the locked and brimming coffer of transmitted daemon-lore. 3
3
Suddenly a ray of physical light shot through these phantasms, and Malone 3
heard the sound of oars amidst the blasphemies of things that should be dead. A 3
3
3
3
598 3
3
3
3
boat with a lantern in its prow darted into sight, made fast to an iron ring in the 3
sHmy stone pier, and vomited forth several dark men bearing a long burden 3
swathed in bedding. They took it to the naked phosphorescent thing on the 3
carved golden pedestal, and the thing tittered and pawed at the bedding. Then 3
they unswathed it, and propped upright before the pedestal the gangrenous 3
corpse of a corpulent old man with stubbly beard and unkempt white hair. The 3
phosphorescent thing tittered again, and the men produced bottles from their 3
pockets and anointed its feet with red, whilst they afterward gave the bottles to 3
the thing to drink from. 3
3
All at once, from an arcaded avenue leading endlessly away, there came the 3
daemoniac rattle and wheeze of a blasphemous organ, choking and rumbling out 3
the mockeries of hell in a cracked, sardonic bass. In an instant every moving 3
entity was electrified; and forming at once into a ceremonial procession, the 3
nightmare horde slithered away in quest of the sound - goat, satyr, and ^gypan, 3
incubus, succubus and lemur, twisted toad and shapeless elemental, dog-faced 3
howler and silent strutter in darkness - all led by the abominable naked 3
phosphorescent thing that had squatted on the carved golden throne, and that 3
now strode insolently bearing in its arms the glassy-eyed corpse of the corpulent 3
old man. The strange dark men danced in the rear, and the whole column 3
skipped and leaped with Dionysiac fury. Malone staggered after them a few 3
steps, delirious and hazy, and doubtful of his place in this or in any world. Then 3
he turned, faltered, and sank down on the cold damp stone, gasping and 3
shivering as the daemon organ croaked on, and the howling and drumming and 3
tinkling of the mad procession grew fainter and fainter. 3
3
Vaguely he was conscious of chanted horrors and shocking croakings afar off. 3
Now and then a wail or whine of ceremonial devotion would float to him 3
through the black arcade, whilst eventually there rose the dreadful Greek 3
incantation whose text he had read above the pulpit of that dance-hall church. 3
3
'O friend and companion of night, thou who rejoicest in the baying of dogs (here 3
a hideous howl bust forth) and spilt blood (here nameless sounds vied with 3
morbid shriekings) who wanderest in the midst of shades among the tombs, 3
(here a whistling sigh occurred) who longest for blood and bringest terror to 3
mortals, (short, sharp cries from myriad throats) Gorgo, (repeated as response) 3
Mormo, (repeated with ecstasy) thousand-faced moon, (sighs and flute notes) 3
look favourably on our sacrifices!' 3
3
As the chant closed, a general shout went up, and hissing sounds nearly 3
drowned the croaking of the cracked bass organ. Then a gasp as from many 3
throats, and a babel of barked and bleated words - 'Lilith, Great Lilith, behold the 3
Bridegroom!' More cries, a clamour of rioting, and the sharp, clicking footfalls of 3
3
3
3
599 3
3
3
3
a running figure. The footfalls approached, and Malone raised himself to his 3
elbow to look. 3
3
The luminosity of the crypt, lately diminished, had now slightly increased; and 3
in that devil-light there appeared the fleeing form of that which should not flee 3
or feel or breathe - the glassy-eyed, gangrenous corpse of the corpulent old man, 3
now needing no support, but animated by some infernal sorcery of the rite just 3
closed. After it raced the naked, tittering, phosphorescent thing that belonged on 3
the carven pedestal, and still farther behind panted the dark men, and all the 3
dread crew of sentient loathsomenesses. The corpse was gaining on its pursuers, 3
and seemed bent on a definite object, straining with every rotting muscle toward 3
the carved golden pedestal, whose necromantic importance was evidently so 3
great. Another moment and it had reached its goal, whilst the trailing throng 3
laboured on with more frantic speed. But they were too late, for in one final spurt 3
of strength which ripped tendon from tendon and sent its noisome bulk 3
floundering to the floor in a state of jellyish dissolution, the staring corpse which 3
had been Robert Suydam achieved its object and its triumph. The push had been 3
tremendous, but the force had held out; and as the pusher collapsed to a muddy 3
blotch of corruption the pedestal he had pushed tottered, tipped, and finally 3
careened from its onyx base into the thick waters below, sending up a parting 3
gleam of carven gold as it sank heavily to undreamable gulfs of lower Tartarus. 3
In that instant, too, the whole scene of horror faded to nothingness before 3
Malone's eyes; and he fainted amidst a thunderous crash which seemed to blot 3
out all the evil universe. 3
3
VII 3
3
Malone's dream, experienced in full before he knew of Suydam's death and 3
transfer at sea, was curiously supplemented by some odd realities of the case; 3
though that is no reason why anyone should believe it. The three old houses in 3
Parker Place, doubtless long rotten with decay in its most insidious form, 3
collapsed without visible cause while half the raiders and most of the prisoners 3
were inside; and of both the greater number were instantly killed. Only in the 3
basements and cellars was there much saving of life, and Malone was lucky to 3
have been deep below the house of Robert Suydam. For he really was there, as 3
no one is disposed to deny. They found him unconscious by the edge of a night- 3
black pool, with a grotesquely horrible jumble of decay and bone, identifiable 3
through dental work as the body of Suydam, a few feet away. The case was 3
plain, for it was hither that the smugglers' underground canal led; and the men 3
who took Suydam from the ship had brought him home. They themselves were 3
never found, or at least never identified; and the ship's doctor is not yet satisfied 3
with the simple certitudes of the police. 3
3
3
3
600 3
3
3
3
Suydam was evidently a leader in extensive man-smuggling operations, for the 3
canal to his house was but one of several subterranean channels and tunnels in 3
the neighbourhood. There was a tunnel from this house to a crypt beneath the 3
dance-hall church; a crypt accessible from the church only through a narrow 3
secret passage in the north wall, and in whose chambers some singular and 3
terrible things were discovered. The croaking organ was there, as well as a vast 3
arched chapel with wooden benches and a strangely figured altar. The walls 3
were lined with small cells, in seventeen of which - hideous to relate - solitary 3
prisoners in a state of complete idiocy were found chained, including four 3
mothers with infants of disturbingly strange appearance. These infants died soon 3
after exposure to the light; a circumstance which the doctors thought rather 3
merciful. Nobody but Malone, among those who inspected them, remembered 3
the sombre question of old Delrio: 'An sint unquam daemones incubi et 3
succubae, et an ex tali congressu proles nasci queat?' 3
3
Before the canals were filled up they were thoroughly dredged, and yielded forth 3
a sensational array of sawed and split bones of all sizes. The kidnapping 3
epidemic, very clearly, had been traced home; though only two of the surviving 3
prisoners could by any legal thread be connected with it. These men are now in 3
prison, since they failed of conviction as accessories in the actual murders. The 3
carved golden pedestal or throne so often mentioned by Malone as of primary 3
occult importance was never brought to light, though at one place under the 3
Suydam house the canal was observed to sink into a well too deep for dredging. 3
It was choked up at the mouth and cemented over when the cellars of the new 3
houses were made, but Malone often speculates on what lies beneath. The police, 3
satisfied that they had shattered a dangerous gang of maniacs and man- 3
smugglers, turned over to the Federal authorities the unconvicted Kurds, who 3
befure their deportation were conclusively found to belong to the Yezidi clan of 3
devil-worshippers. The tramp ship and its crew remain an elusive mystery, 3
though cynical detectives are once more ready to combat its smugging and rum- 3
running ventures. Malone thinks these detectives shew a sadly limited 3
perspective in their lack of wonder at the myriad unexplainable details, and the 3
suggestive obscurity of the whole case; though he is just as critical of the 3
newspapers, which saw only a morbid sensation and gloated over a minor sadist 3
cult which they might have proclaimed a horror from the universe's very heart. 3
But he is content to rest silent in Chepachet, calming his nervous system and 3
praying that time may gradually transfer his terrible experience from the realm 3
of present reality to that of picturesque and semi-mythical remoteness. 3
3
Robert Suydam sleeps beside his bride in Greenwood Cemetery. No funeral was 3
held over the strangely released bones, and relatives are grateful for the swift 3
oblivion which overtook the case as a whole. The scholar's connexion with the 3
Red Hook horrors, indeed, was never emblazoned by legal proof; since his death 3
3
3
3
601 3
3
3
3
forestalled the inquiry he would otherwise have faced. His own end is not much 3
mentioned, and the Suydams hope that posterity may recall him only as a gentle 3
recluse who dabbled in harmless magic and folklore. 3
3
As for Red Hook - it is always the same. Suydam came and went; a terror 3
gathered and faded; but the evil spirit of darkness and squalor broods on 3
amongst the mongrels in the old brick houses, and prowling bands still parade 3
on unknown errands past windows where lights and twisted faces 3
unaccountably appear and disappear. Age-old horror is a hydra with a thousand 3
heads, and the cults of darkness are rooted in blasphemies deeper than the well 3
of Democritus, The soul of the beast is omnipresent and triumphant, and Red 3
Hook's legions of blear-eyed, pockmarked youths still chant and curse and howl 3
as they file from abyss to abyss, none knows whence or whither, pushed on by 3
blind laws of biology which they may never understand. As of old, more people 3
enter Red Hook than leave it on the landward side, and there are already 3
rumours of new canals running underground to certain centres of traffic in liquor 3
and less mentionable things. 3
3
The dance-hall church is now mostly a dance-hall, and queer faces have 3
appeared at night at the windows. Lately a policeman expressed the belief that 3
the filled-up crypt has been dug out again, and for no simply explainable 3
purpose. Who are we to combat poisons older than history and mankind? Apes 3
danced in Asia to those horrors, and the cancer lurks secure and spreading 3
where furtiveness hides in rows of decaying brick. 3
3
Malone does not shudder without cause - for only the other day an officer 3
overheard a swarthy squinting hag teaching a small child some whispered patois 3
in the shadow of an areaway. He listened, and thought it very strange when he 3
heard her repeat over and over again, 3
3
'O friend and companion of night, thou who rejoicest in the baying of dogs and 3
spilt blood, who wanderest in the midst of shades among the tombs, who longest 3
for blood and bringest terror to mortals, Gorgo, Mormo, thousand-faced moon, 3
look favourably on our sacrifices!' 3

3
The Horror in the Museum 3
3
1 3
3
IT WAS languid curiousity which first brought Stephen Jones to Rogers' 3
Museum. Someone had told him about the queer underground place in 3
Southwark Street across the river, where waxen things so much more horrible 3
than the worst effigies at Madame Tussaud's were shown, and he had strolled in 3
one April day to see how disappointing he would find it. Oddly, he was not 3
disappointed. There was something different and distinctive here, after all. Of 3
course, the usual gory commonplaces were present-Landru, Doctor Crippen, 3
Madame Demers, Rizzio, Lady Jane Grey, endless maimed victims of war and 3
revolution, and monsters like Gilles de Rais and Marquis de Sade-but there were 3
other things which had made him breathe faster and stay till the ringing of the 3
closing bell. The man who had fashioned this collection could be no ordinary 3
mountebank. There was imagination-even a kind of diseased genius-in some of 3
this stuff. 3
3
Later he had learned about George Rogers. The man had been on the Tussaud 3
staff, but some trouble had developed which led to his discharge. There were 3
aspersions on his sanity and tales of his crazy forms of secret worship-though 3
latterly his success with his own basement museum had dulled the edge of some 3
criticisms while sharpening the insidious point of others. Teratology and the 3
iconography of nightmare were his hobbies, and even he had had the prudence 3
to screen off some of his worst effigies in a special alcolve for adults only. It was 3
this alcolve which had fascinated Jones so much. There were lumpish hybrid 3
things which only fantasy could spawn, molded with devilish skill, and colored 3
in a horribly life-like fashion. 3
3
Some were the figures of well-known myth-gorgons, chimeras, dragons, Cyclops, 3
and all their shuddersome congeners. Others were drawn from darker and more 3
furtively whispered cycles of subterranean legend-black, formless Tsathoggua, 3
many-tentacled Cthulhu, proboscidian Chaugnar Faugn, and other rumored 3
blasphemies from forbidden books like the Necronomicon, the Book of Eibon, or 3
the Unaussprechlichen Kulten of von Junzt. But the worst were wholly original 3
with Rogers, and represented shapes which no tale of antiquity had ever dared 3
to suggest. Several were hideous parodies on forms of organic life we know, 3
while others seemed to be taken from feverish dreams of other planets and 3
galaxies. The wilder painted of Clark Ashton Smith might suggest a few-but 3
nothing could suggest the effect of poignant, loathsome terror created by their 3
great size and fiendishly cunning workmanship, and by the diabolically clever 3
lighting conditions under which they were exhibited. 3

Stephen Jones, as a leisurely connoisseur of the bizarre in art, had sought out 3
Rogers himself in the dingy office and workroom behind the vaulted museum 3
chamber-an evil-looking crypt lighted dimly by dusty windows set slit-like and 3
horizontal in the brick wall on a level with the ancient cobblestones of a hidden 3
courtyard. It was here that the images were repaired-here, too, where some of 3
them had been made. Waxen arms, legs, heads and torsos lay in grotesque array 3
on various benches, while on high tiers of shelves matted wigs, ravenous-looking 3
teeth, and glassy, staring eyes were indiscriminately scattered. Costumes of all 3
sorts hung from hooks, and in one alcove were great piles of flesh-colored wax- 3
cakes and shelves filled with paint-cans and brushes of every description. In the 3
center of the room was a large melting-furnace used to prepare the wax for 3
molding, its fire-box topped by a huge iron container on hinges, with a spout 3
which permitted the pouring of melted wax with the merest touch of a finger. 3
3
Other things in the dismal crypt were less describable-isolated parts of 3
problematical entities whose assembled forms were the phantoms of delerium. 3
At one end was a door of heavy plank, fastened by an unusually large padlock 3
and with a very peculiar symbol painted over it. Jone, who had once had access 3
to the dreaded Necronomicon, shivered involuntarily as he recognized that 3
symbol. This showman, he reflected, must indeed be a person of disconcertingly 3
wide scholarship in dark and dubious fields. 3
3
Nor did the conversation of Rogers disappoint him. The man was tall, lean, and 3
rather unkempt, with large black eyes which gazed combustively from a pallid 3
and usually stubble-covered face. He did not resent Jones' intrusion, but seemed 3
to welcome the chance of unburdening himself to an interested person. His voice 3
was of singular depth and resonance, and harbored a sort of repressed intensity 3
bordering on the feverish. Jones did not wonder that many had thought him 3
mad. 3
3
With every successive call-and such calls became a habit as the weeks went by- 3
Jones had found Rogers more communicative and confidential. From the first 3
there had been hints of strange faiths and practices on the showman's part, and 3
later on those hints expanded into tales-despite a few odd corroborative 3
photographs-whose extravagence was almost comic. It was some time in June, 3
on a night when Jones had brought a bottle of good whisky and plied his host 3
somewhat freely, that the really demented talk first appeared. Before that there 3
had been wild enough stories-accounts of mysterious trips to Tibet, the African 3
interior, the Arabian desert, the Amazon valley, Alaska, and certain little-known 3
islands of the South Pacific, plus claims of having read such monstrous and half- 3
fabulous books as the prehistoric Pnakotic fragments and the Dhol chants 3
attributed to malign and non-human Leng-but nothing in all this had been so 3
3
3
3
604 3
3
3
3
unmistakably insane as what had cropped out that June evening under the spell 3
of the whisky. 3
3
To be plain, Rogers began making vauge boasts of having found certain things in 3
nature that no one had found before, and of having brought back tangible 3
evidences of such discoveries. According to his bibulous harangue, he had gone 3
farther than anyone else in interpreting the obscure and primal books he studied, 3
and had been directed by them to certain remote places where strange survivals 3
are hidden-survivals of aeons and life-cycles earlier than mankind, and in some 3
case connected with other dimensions and other worlds, communication with 3
which was frequent in the forgotten pre-human days. Jones marvelled at the 3
fancy which could conjure up such notions, and wondered just what Rogers' 3
mental history had been. Had his work amidst the morbid grotesequeries of 3
Madame Tussaud's been the start of his imaginative flights, or was the tendency 3
innate, so that his choice of occupation was merely one of its manifestations? At 3
any rate, the man's work was merely [?] very closely linked with his notions. 3
Even now there was no mistaking the trend of his blackest hints about the 3
nightmare monstrosities in the screened-off "Adults only" alcove. Heedless of 3
ridicule, he was trying to imply that not all of these demoniac abnormalities were 3
artificial. 3
3
It was Jones' frank scepticism and amusement at these irresponsible claims 3
which broke up the growing cordiality. Rogers, it was clear, took himself very 3
seriously; for he now became morose and resentful, continuing to tolerate Jones 3
only through a dogged urge to break down his wall of urbane and complacent 3
incredulity. Wild tales and suggestions of rites and sacrifices to nameless elder 3
gods continued, and now and then Rogers would lead his guest to one of the 3
hideous blashphemies in the screen-off alcolve and point out features difficult to 3
reconcile with even the finest human craftsmanship. Jones continued his visits 3
through sheer fascination, though he knew he had forfeited his host's regards. At 3
times he would humor Rogers with pretended assent to some mad hint or 3
assertion, but the gaunt showman was seldom to be deceived by such tactics. 3
3
The tension came to a head later in September. Jones had casually dropped into 3
the museum one afternoon, and was wandering through the dim corridors 3
whose horror were now so familiar, when he heard a very peculiar sound from 3
the general direction of Rogers' workroom. Others heard it too, and started 3
nervously as the echoes reverberated through the great vaulted basement. The 3
three attendants exchanged odd glances; and one of them, a dark, taciturn, 3
foreign-looking fellow who always served Rogers as a repairer and assistant 3
designer, smiled in a way which seemed to puzzle his colleagues and which 3
grated very harshly on some facet of Jones' sensibilities. It was the yelp or scream 3
of a dog, and was such a sound as could be made only under conditions of the 3
3
3
3
605 3
3
3
3
utmost fright and agony combined. Its stark, anguised frenzy was appalling to 3
hear, and in this setting of grotesque abnormality it held a double hideousness. 3
Jones remembered that no dogs were allowed in the museum. 3
3
He was about to go to the door leading into the workroom, when the dark 3
attendant stopped him with a word and a gesture. Mr. Rogers, the man said in a 3
soft, somewhat accented voice at once apologetic and vaguely sardonic, was out, 3
and there were standing orders to admit no one to the workroom during his 3
absence. As for that yelp, it was undoubtedly something out in the courtyard 3
behind the museum. This neighborhood was full of stray mongrels, and their 3
fights were sometimes shockingly noisy. There were no dogs in any part of the 3
museum. But if Mr. Jones wished to see Mr. Rogers he might find him just before 3
closing-time. 3
3
After this Jones climbed the old stone steps to the street outside and examined 3
the squalid neighborhood curiously. The leaning, decrepit buildings-once 3
dwellings but now largely shops and warehouses-were very ancient indeed. 3
Some of them were of a gabled type seeming to go back to Tudor times, and a 3
faint miasmatic stench hung subtly about the whole region. Beside the dingy 3
house whose basement held the museum was a low archway pierced by a dark 3
cobbled alley, and this Jones entered in a vague wish to find the courtyard 3
behind the workroom and settle the affair of the dog comfortably in his mind. 3
The courtyard was dim in the late afternoon light, hemmed in by rear walls even 3
uglier and more intangibly menacing than the crumbling facades of the evil old 3
houses. Not a dog was in sight, and Jones wondered how the aftermath of such a 3
frantic turmoil could have completely vanished so soon. 3
3
Despite the assistant's statement that no dog had been in the museum, Jones 3
glanced nervously at the three small windows of the basement workroom- 3
narrow, horizontal rectangles close to the grass-grown pavement, with grimy 3
panes that stared repulsively and incuriously like the eyes of dead fish. To their 3
left a worn flight of stairs led to an opaque and heavily bolted door. Some 3
impulse urged him to crouch low on the damp, broken cobblestones and peer in, 3
on the chance that the thick green shades, worked by long cords that hung down 3
to a reachable level, might not be drawn. The outer surfaces were thick with dirt, 3
but as he rubbed them with his handkerchief he saw there was no obscuring 3
curtain in the way of his vision. 3
3
So shadowed was the cellar from the inside that not much could be made out, 3
but the grotesque working paraphernalia now and then loomed up spectrally as 3
Jones tried each of the windows in turn. It seemed evident at first that no one 3
was within; yet when he peered through the extreme right-hand window-the 3
one nearest the entrance alley-he saw a glow of light at the farther end of the 3
3
3
3
606 3
3
3
3
apartment which made him pause in bewilderment. There was no reason why 3
any hght should be there. It was an inner side of the room, and he could not 3
recall any gas or electric fixture near that point. Another look defined the glow as 3
a large vertical rectangle, and a though occurred to him. It was in that direction 3
that he had always noticed the heavy plank door with the abnormally large 3
padlock-the door which was never opened, and above which was crudely 3
smeared that hideous cryptic symbol from the fragmentary records of forbidden 3
elder magic. It must be open now-and there was a light inside. All his former 3
speculation as to where that door led, and as to what lay behind it, were now 3
renewed with trebly disquieting force. 3
3
Jones wandered aimlessly around the dismal locality till close to six o'clock, 3
when he returned to the museum to make the call on Rogers. He could hardly 3
tell why he wished so especially to see the man just then, but there must have 3
been some subconscious misgivings about that terribly unplaceable canine 3
scream of the afternnon, and about the glow of light in that disturbing and 3
usually unopened inner doorway with the heavy padlock. The attendants were 3
leaving as he arrived, and he thought that Orabona-the dark foreign-looking 3
assistant-eyed him with something like sly, repressed amusement. He did not 3
relish that look-even though he had seen the fellow turn it on his employer 3
many times. 3
3
The vaulted exhibition room was ghoulish in its desertion, but he strode quickly 3
through it and rapped at the door of the office and workroom. Response was 3
slow in coming, though there were footsteps inside. Finally, in response to a 3
second knock, the lock rattled, and the ancient six-panelled portal creaked 3
reluctantly open to reveal the slouching, feverish-eyed form of George Rogers. 3
From the first it was clear that the showman was in an unusual mood. There was 3
a curious mixture of reluctance and actual gloating in his welcome, and his talk 3
at once veered to extravagances of the most hideous and incredible sort. 3
3
Surviving elder gods-nameless sacrifices-the other than artificial nature of some 3
of the alcove horrors-all the usual boasts, but uttered in a tone of peculiarly 3
increasing confidence. Obviously, Jones reflected, the poor fellow's madness was 3
gaining on him. From time to time Rogers would send furtive glances toward the 3
heavy, padlocked inner door at the end of the room, or toward a piece of coarse 3
burlap on the floor not far from it, beneath which some small object appeared to 3
be lying. Jones grew more nervous as the moments passed, and began to feel as 3
hesitant about mentioning the afternoon's oddities as he had formerly been 3
anxious to do so. 3
3
Rogers' sepulchrally resonant bass almost cracked under the excitement of his 3
fevered rambling. 3
3
3
3
607 3
3
3
3
"Do you remember/' he shouted, "what I told you about that ruined city in Indo- 3
China where the Tcho-Tchos hved? You had to admit I'd been there when you 3
saw the photographs, even if you did think I made that oblong swimmer in 3
darkness out of wax. If you'd seen it writhing in the underground pools as I did. 3
3
3
3
"Well, this is bigger still. I never told you about this, because I wanted to work 3
out the later parts before making any claim. When you see the snapshots you'll 3
know the geography couldn't have been faked, and I fancy I have another way of 3
proving It isn't any waxed concoction of mine. You've never seen it, for the 3
experiments wouldn't let me keep It on exhibition." 3
3
The showman glanced queerly at the padlocked door. 3
3
"It all comes from that long ritual in the eighth Pnakotic fragment. When I got it 3
figured out I saw it could only have one meaning. There were things in the north 3
before the land of Lomar-before mankind existed-and this was one of them. It 3
took us all the way to Alaska, and up the Nootak from Fort Morton, but the thing 3
was there as we knew it would be. Great cyclopean ruins, acres of them. There 3
was less left than we had hoped for, but after three million years what could one 3
expect? And weren't the Eskimo legends all in the right direction? We couldn't 3
get one of the beggars to go with us, and had to sledge all the way back to Nome 3
for Americans. Orabona was no good up in that climate-it made him sullen and 3
hateful. 3
3
"I'll tell you later how we found It. When we got the ice blasted out of the pylons 3
of the central ruin the stairway was just as we knew it would be. Some carvings 3
still there, and it was no trouble keeping the Yankees from following us in. 3
Orabona shivered like a leaf-you'd never think it from the damned insolent way 3
he struts around here. He knew enough of the Elder Lore to be properly afraid. 3
The eternal light was gone, but our torches showed enough. We saw the bones of 3
others who had been before us-aeons ago, when the climate was warm. Some of 3
those bones were of things you couldn't even imagine. At the third level down 3
we found the ivory throne the fragments said so much about-and I may as well 3
tell you it wasn't empty. 3
3
"The thing on the throne didn't move-and we knew then that It needed the 3
nourishment of sacrifice. But we didn't want to wake It then. Better to get It to 3
London first. Orabona and I went to the surface for the big box, but when we had 3
packed it we couldn't get It up the three flights of steps. These steps weren't 3
made for human beings, and their size bothered us. Anyway, it was devilish 3
heavy. We had to have the Americans down to get It out. They weren't anxious 3
to go into the place, but of course the worst thing was safely inside the box. We 3
3
3
3
608 3
3
3
3
told them it was a batch of ivory carving-archeological stuff; and after seeing the 3
carved throne they probably believed us. It's a wonder they didn't suspect 3
hidden treasure and demand a share. They must have told queer tales around 3
Nome later on; though I doubt if they ever went back to those ruins, even for the 3
ivory throne." 3
3
Rogers paused, felt around in his desk, and produced an envelope of good-sized 3
photographic prints. Extracting one and laying it face down before him, he 3
handed the rest to Jones. The set was certainly an odd one: ice-clad hills, dog 3
sledges, men in furs, and vast tumbled ruins against a background of snow-ruins 3
whose bizarre outlines and enormous stone blocks could hardly be accounted 3
for. One flashlight view showed an incredible interior chamber with wild 3
carvings and a curious throne whose proportions could not have been designed 3
for a human occupant. The carvings of the gigantic masonry-high walls and 3
peculiar vaulting overhead-were mainly symbolic, and involved both wholly 3
unknown designs and certain hieroglyphs darkly cited in obscene legends. Over 3
the throne loomed the same dreadful symbol which was now painted on the 3
workroom wall above the padlocked plank door. Jones darted a nervous glance 3
at the closed portal. Assuredly, Rogers had been to strange places and had seen 3
strange things. Yet this mad interior picture might easily be a fraud-taken from a 3
very clever stage setting. One must not be too credulous. But Rogers was 3
continuing: 3
3
"Well, we shipped the box from Nome and got to London without any trouble. 3
That was the first time we'd ever brought back anything that had a chance of 3
coming alive. I didn't put It on display, because there were more important 3
things to do for It. It needed the nourishment of sacrifice, for It was a god. Of 3
course I couldn't get It the sort of sacrifices which It used to have in Its day, for 3
such things don't exist now. But there were other things which might do. The 3
blood is the life, you know. Even the lemures and elementals that are older than 3
the earth will come when the blood of men or beasts is offered under the right 3
conditions." 3
3
The expression on the narrator's face was growing very alarming and repulsive, 3
so that Jones fidgeted involuntarily in his chair. Rogers seemed to notice his 3
guest's nervousness, and continued with a distinctly evil smile. 3
3
"It was last year that I got It, and ever since then I've been trying rites and 3
sacrifices. Orabona hasn't been much help, for he was always against the idea of 3
waking It. He hates It-probably because he's afraid of what It will come to mean. 3
He carries a pistol all the time to protect himself-fool, as if there were human 3
protection against It! If I ever see him draw that pistol, I'll strangle him. He 3
wanted me to kill It and make an effigy of It. But I've stuck by my plans, and I'm 3
3
3
3
609 3
3
3
3
coming out on top in spite of all the cowards like Orabona and damned 3
sniggering skeptics like you, Jones! I've chanted the rites and made certain 3
sacrifices, and last week the transition came. The sacrifice was-received and 3
enjoyed!" 3
3
Rogers actually licked his lips, while Jones held himsef uneasily rigid. The 3
showman paused and rose, crossing the room to the piece of burlap at which he 3
had glanced so often. Bending down, he took hold of one corner as he spoke 3
again. 3
3
"You've laughed enough at my work-now it's time for you to get some facts. 3
Orabona tells me you heard a dog screaming around here this afternoon. Do you 3
know what that meant?" 3
3
Jones started. For all his curiousity he would have been glad to get out without 3
further light on the point which had so puzzled him. But Rogers was inexorable, 3
and began to lift the square of burlap. Beneath it lay a crushed, almost shapeless 3
mass which Jones was slow to classify. Was it a once-living thing which some 3
agency had flattened, sucked dry of blood, punctured in a thousand places, and 3
wrung into a limp, broken-boned heap of grotesqeness? After a moment Jones 3
realized what it must be. It was what was left of a dog-a dog, perhaps of 3
considerable size and whitish color. Its breed was past recognition, for distortion 3
had come in nameless and hideous ways. Most of the hair was burned off as by 3
some pungent acid, and the exposed, bloodless skin was riddled by innumerable 3
circular wounds or incisions. The form of torture necessary to cause such results 3
was past imagining. 3
3
Electrified with a pure loathing which conquered his mounting disgust, Jones 3
sprang with a cry. 3
3
"You damned sadist-you madman-you do a thing like this and dare to speak to 3
a decent man!" 3
3
Rogers dropped the burlap with a malignant sneer and faced his oncoming 3
guest. His words held an unnatural calm. 3
3
"Why, you fool, do you think I did this? What of it? It is not human and does not 3
pretend to be. To sacrifice is merely to offer. I gave the dog to It. What happened 3
is It's work, not mine. It needed the nourishment of the offering, and took it in Its 3
own way. But let me show you what It looks like." 3
3
As Jones stood hesitating, the speaker had returned to his desk and took up the 3
photograph he had laid face down without showing. Now he extended it with a 3
3
3
3
610 3
3
3
3
curious look. Jones took it and glanced at in in an almost mechanical way. After a 3
moment the visitor's glance became sharper and more absorbed, for the utterly 3
Satanic force of the object depicted had an almost hypnotic effect. Certainly, 3
Rogers had outdone himself in modeling the eldritch nightmare which the 3
camera had caught. The thing was a work of sheer, infernal genius, and Jones 3
wondered how the public would react when it was placed on exhibition. So 3
hideous a thing had no right to exist-probably the mere contemplation of it, after 3
it was done, had completed the unhinging of its maker's mind and led him to 3
worship it with brutal sacrifices. Only a stout sanity could resist the insidious 3
suggestion that the blasphemy was-or had once been-some morbid and exotic 3
form of actual life. 3
3
The thing in the picture squatted or was balanced on what appeared to be a 3
clever reproduction of the monstrously carved throne in the other curious 3
photograph. To describe it with any ordinary vocabulary would be impossible, 3
for nothing even roughly corresponding to it has ever come within the 3
imagination of sane mankind. It represented something meant perhaps to be 3
roughly connected with the vertebrates of this planet-though one could not be 3
too sure of that. Its bulk was cyclopean, for even squatted it towered to almost 3
twice the height of Orabona, who was shown beside it. Looking sharply, one 3
might trace its approximations toward the bodily features of the higher 3
vertebrates. 3
3
There was an almost globular torso, with six long, sinuous limbs terminating in 3
crab-like claws. From the upper end a subsidiary globe bulged forth bubble-like; 3
its triangle of three staring, fishy eyes, its foot-long and evidently flexible 3
proboscis, and a distended lateral system analogous to gills, suggesting that it 3
was a head. Most of the body was covered with what at first appeared to be fur, 3
but which on closer examination proved to be a dense growth of dark, slender 3
tentacles or sucking filaments, each tipped with a mouth suggesting the head of 3
an asp. On the head and below the proboscis the tentacles tended to be longer 3
and thicker, marked with spiral stripes-suggesting the traditional serpent-locks 3
of Medusa. To suggest that such a thing could have an expression seems 3
paradoxical; yet Jones felt that that triangle of bulging fish eyes and that 3
obliquely poised proboscis all bespoke a blend of hate, greed and sheer cruelty 3
incomprehensible to mankind because it was mixed with other emotions not of 3
the world or this solar system. Into this bestial abnormality, he reflected, Rogers 3
must have poured at once all his malignant insanity and all his uncanny 3
sculptural genius. The thing was incredible-and yet the photograph proved that 3
it existed. 3
3
Rogers interrupted his reveries. 3
3
3
3
611 3
3
3
3
"Well-what do you think of It? Now do you wonder what crushed the dog and 3
sucked it dry with a milHon mouths? It needed nourishment-and It will need 3
more. It is a god, and I am the first priest of Its latter-day hierarchy. la! Shub- 3
Niggurath! The Goat with a Thousand Young!" 3
3
Jones lowered the photograph in disgust and pity. 3
3
"See here, Rogers, this won't do. There are limits, you know. It's a great piece of 3
work, and all that, but it isn't good for you. Better not see it any more-let 3
Orabona break it up, and try to forget about it. And let me tear this beastly 3
picture up, too." 3
3
With a snarl, Rogers snatched the photograph and returned it to the desk. 3
3
"Idiot-you-and you still think It's a fraud! You still think I made It, and you still 3
think my figures are nothing but lifeless wax! Why, damn you, you're going to 3
know. Not just now, for It is resting after the sacrifice-but later. Oh, yes-you will 3
not doubt the power of It then." 3
3
As Rogers glanced toward the padlocked inner door Jones retrieved his hat and 3
stick from a near-by bench. 3
3
"Very well, Rogers, let it be later. I must be going now, but I'll call round 3
tomorrow afternoon. Think my advice over and see if it doesn't sound sensible. 3
Ask Orabona what he thinks, too." 3
3
Rogers bared his teeth in wild-beast fashion. 3
3
"Must be going now, eh? Afraid, after all! Afraid, for all your bold talk! You say 3
the effigies are only wax, and yet you run away when I begin to prove that they 3
aren't. You're like the fellows who take my standing bet that they daren't spend 3
the night in the museum-they come boldly enough, but after an hour they shriek 3
and hammer to get out! Want me to ask Orabona, eh? You two-always against 3
me! You want to break down the coming earthly reign of It!" 3
3
Jones preserved his calm. 3
3
"No, Rogers-there's nobody against you. And I'm not afraid of your figures, 3
either, much as I admire your skill. But we're both a bit nervous tonight, and I 3
fancy some rest will do us good." 3
3
Again Rogers checked his guest's departure. 3
3
3
3
612 3
3
3
3
"Not afraid, eh?-then why are you so anxious to go? Look here-do you or don't 3
you dare to stay alone here in the dark? What's your hurry if you don't beheve in 3
It?" 3
3
Some new idea seemed to have struck Rogers, and Jones eyed him closely. 3
3
"Why, I've no special hurry-but what would be gained by my staying here 3
alone? What would it prove? My only objection is that it isn't very comfortable 3
for sleeping. What good would it do either of us?" 3
3
This time it was Jones who was struck with an idea. He continued in a tone of 3
conciliation. 3
3
"See here, Rogers-I've just asked you what it would prove if I stayed, when we 3
both knew. It would prove that your effigies are just effigies, and that you 3
oughtn't to let your imagination go the way it's been going lately. Suppose I do 3
stay. If I stick it out till morning, will you agree to take a new view of things-go 3
on a vacation for three months or so and let Orabona destroy that new thing of 3
yours? Come, now-isn't that fair?" 3
3
The expression on the showman's face was hard to read. It was obvious that he 3
was thinking quickly, and that of sundry conflicting emotions, malign triumph 3
was getting the upper hand. His voice held a choking quality as he replied. 3
3
"Fair enough! If you do stick it out, I'll take your advice. We'll go out for dinner 3
and come back. I'll lock you in the display room and go home. In the morning I'll 3
come down ahead of Orabona-he comes half an hour before the rest-and see 3
how you are. But don't try it unless you are very sure of your skepticism. Others 3
have backed out-you have that chance. And I suppose a pounding on the outer 3
door would always bring a constable. You may not like it so well after a while- 3
you'U be in the same building, though not in the same room with It." 3
3
As they left the rear door into the dingy courtyard, Rogers took with him the 3
piece of burlap-weighted with a gruesome burden. Near the center of the court 3
was a manhole, whose cover the showman lifted quietly, and with a 3
shuddersome suggestion of familiarity. Burlap and all, the burden went down to 3
the oblivion of a cloacal labyrinth. Jones shuddered, and almost shrank from the 3
gaunt figure at his side as they emerged into the street. 3
3
By unspoken mutual consent, they did not dine together, but agreed to meet in 3
front of the museum at eleven. 3
3
Jones hailed a cab, and breathed more freely when he had crossed Waterloo 3
Bridge and was approaching the brilliantly lighted Strand. He dined at a quite 3
3
3
3
613 3
3
3
3
cafe, and subsequently went to his home in Portland Place to bathe and get a few 3
things. Idly he wondered what Rogers was doing. He had heard that the man 3
had a vast, dismal house in the Walworth Road, full of obscure and forbidden 3
books, occult paraphernalia, and wax images which he did not choose to place 3
on exhibition. Orabona, he understood, lived in separate quarters in the same 3
house. 3
3
At eleven Jones found Rogers waiting by the basement door in Southwark Street. 3
Their words were few, but each seemed taut with a menacing tension. They 3
agreed that the vaulted exhibition room alone should form the scene of the vigil, 3
and Rogers did not insist that the watcher sit in the special adult alcove of 3
supreme horrors. The showman, having extinguished all the lights with switches 3
in the workroom, locked the door of that crypt with one of the keys on his 3
crowded ring. Without shaking hands he passed out the street door, locked it 3
after him, and passed up the worn steps to the sidewalk outside. As his tread 3
receded, Jones realized that the long, tedious vigil had commenced. 3
3
3
3
Later, in the utter blackness of the great arched cellar, Jones cursed the childish 3
naivete which had brought him there. For the first half-hour he had kept flashing 3
his pocket-light at intervals, but now just sitting in the dark on one of the visitor's 3
benches had become a more nerve-wracking thing. Every time the beam shot out 3
it lighted up some morbid, grotesque object-a guillotine, a nameless hybrid 3
monster, a pasty-bearded face crafty with evil, a body with red torrents 3
streaming from a severed throat. Jones knew that no sinister reality was attached 3
to these things, but after that first half-hour he preferred not to see them. 3
3
Why he had bothered to humor that madman he could scarcely imagine. It 3
would have been much simpler merely to have let him alone, or to have called in 3
a mental specialist. Probably, he reflected, it was the fellow-feeling of one artist 3
for another. There was so much genius in Rogers that he deserved every possible 3
chance to be helped quietly out of his growing mania. Any man who could 3
imagine and construct the incredibly life-like things that he had produced was 3
not far from actual greatness. He had the fancy of a Sime or a Dore joined to the 3
minute, scientific craftsmanship of a Blatschka. Indeed, he had done for the 3
world of nightmare what the Blatschkas with their marvelously accurate plant 3
models of finely wrought and coloured glass had done for the world of botany. 3
3
At midnight the strokes of a distant clock filtered through the darkness, and 3
Jones felt cheered by the message from a still-surviving outside world. The 3
vaulted museum chamber was like a tomb-ghastly in its utter solitude. Even a 3
mouse would be cheering company; yet Rogers had once boasted that-for 3
3
3
3
614 3
3
3
3
"certain reasons/' as he said-no mice or even insects ever came near the place. 3
That was very curious, yet it seemed to be true. The deadness and silence were 3
virtually complete. If only something would make a sound! He shuffled his feet, 3
and the echoes came spectrally out of the absolute stillness. He coughed, but 3
there was something mocking in the staccato reverberations. He could not, he 3
vowed, begin talking to himself. That meant nervous disintergration. Time 3
seemed to pass with abnormal and disconcerting slowness. He could have sworn 3
that hours had elapsed since he last flashed the light on his watch, yet here was 3
only the stroke of midnight. 3
3
He wished that his senses were not so preternaturally keen. Something in the 3
darkness and stillness seemed to have sharpened them, so that they responded to 3
faint intimations hardly strong enough to be called true impressions. His ears 3
seemed at times to catch a faint, elusive susurrus which could not quite be 3
identified with the nocturnal hum of the squalid streets outside, and he thought 3
of vague, irrelevant things like the music of the spheres and the unknown, 3
inaccessible life of alien dimensions pressing on our own. Rogers often 3
speculated about such things. 3
3
The floating specks of light in his blackness-drowned eyes seemed inclined to 3
take on curious symmetries of pattern and motion. He had often wondered about 3
those strange rays from the unplumbed abyss which scintillate before us in the 3
absence of all earthly illumination, but he had never known any that behaved 3
just as these were behaving. They lacked the restful aimlessness of ordinary 3
light-specks-suggesting some will and purpose remote from any terrestrial 3
conception. 3
3
Then there was that suggestion of odd stirrings. Nothing was open, yet in spite 3
of the general draftlessness Jones felt that the air was not uniformly quiet. There 3
were intangible variations in pressure-not quite decided enough to suggest the 3
loathsome pawings of unseen elementals. It was abnormally chilly, too. He did 3
not like any of this. The air tested salty, as if it were mixed with the brine of dark 3
subterrene waters, and there was a bare hint of some odor of ineffable mustiness. 3
In the daytime he had never noticed that the waxen figures had an odor. Even 3
now that half-received hint was not the way wax figures ought to smell. It was 3
more like the faint smell of specimens in a natural-history museum. Curious, in 3
view of Rogers' claims that his figures were not all artificial-indeed, it was 3
probably that claim which made one's imagination conjure up the olfactory 3
suspicion. One must guard against excesses of imagination-had not such things 3
driven poor Rogers mad? 3
3
But the utter loneliness of this place was frightful. Even the distant chimes 3
seemed to come from across cosmic gulfs. It made Jones think of that insane 3
3
3
3
615 3
3
3
3
picture which Rogers had showed him-the wildly carved chamber with the 3
cryptic throne which the fellow had claimed was part of a three-million-year-old 3
ruin in the shunned and inaccessible solitudes of the Arctic. Perhaps Rogers had 3
been to Alaska, but that picture was certainly nothing but stage scenery. It 3
couldn't normally be otherwise, with all that carving and those terrible symbols. 3
And that monstrous shape supposed to have been found on that throne-what a 3
flight of diseased fancy! Jones wondered just how far he actually was from the 3
insane masterpiece in wax-probably it was kept behind that heavy, padlocked 3
plank door leading somewhere out of the workroom. But it would never do to 3
brood about a waxen image. Was not the present room full of such things, some 3
of them scarcely less horrible than the dreadful "IT"? And beyond a thin canvas 3
screen on the left was the "Adults only" alcove with its nameless phantoms of 3
delerium. 3
3
The proximity of the numberless waxen shapes began to get on Jones' nerves 3
more and more as the quarter-hours wore on. He knew the museum so well that 3
he could not get rid of their usual images even in the total darkness. Indeed, the 3
darkness had the effect of adding to the remembered images certain very 3
disturbing imginative overtones. The guillotine seemed to creak, and the bearded 3
face of Landru-slayer of his fifty wives-twisted itself into expressions of 3
monstrous menace. From the severed throat of Madame Demers a hideous 3
bubbling sound seemed to emanate, while the headless, legless victim of a trunk 3
murder tried to edge closer and closer on its gory stumps. Jones began shutting 3
his eyes to see if that would dim the images, but found it was useless. Besides, 3
when he shut his eyes the strange, purposeful patterns of light-specks became 3
more disturbingly pronounced. 3
3
Then suddenly he began trying to keep the hideous images he had formerly been 3
trying to banish. He tried to keep them because they were giving place to still 3
more hideous ones. In spite of himself his memory began reconstructing the 3
utterly non-human blasphemies that lurked in the obscurer corners, and these 3
lumpish hybrid growths oozed and wriggled toward him as though huting him 3
down in a circle. Black Tsathoggua molded itself from a toad-like gargoyle to a 3
long, sinuous line with hundreds of rudimentary feet, and a lean, rubbery night- 3
gaunt spread its wings as if to advance and smother the watcher. Jones braced 3
himself to keep from screaming. He knew he was reverting to the traditional 3
terrors of his childhood, and resolved to use his adult reason to keep the 3
phantoms at bay. It helped a bit, he found, to flash the light again. Frightful as 3
were the images it showed, these were not as bad as what his fancy called out of 3
the utter blackness. 3
3
But there were drawbacks. Even in the light of his torch he could not help 3
suspecting a slight, furtive trembling on the part of the canvas partition 3
3
3
3
616 3
3
3
3
screening off the terrible "Adults only" alcove. He knew what lay beyond, and 3
shivered. Imagination called up the shocking forms of fabulous Yog-Sothoth- 3
only a congeries of iridescent globes, yet stupendous in its malign 3
suggestiveness. What was this accursed mass slowly floating toward him and 3
bumping on the partition that stood in the way? A small bulge in the canvas far 3
to the right suggested the sharp horn of Gnoph-keh, the hairy myth-thing of the 3
Greenland ice, that walked sometimes on two legs, sometimes on four, and 3
sometimes on six. To get this stuff out of his head Jones walked boldly toward 3
the hellish alcove with torch burning steadily. Of course, none of his fears was 3
true. Yet were not the long, facial tentalces of great Cthulhu actually swaying, 3
slowly and insidiously? He knew they were flexible, but he had not realised that 3
the draft caused by his advance was enough to set them in motion. 3
3
Returning to his former seat outside the alcove, he shut his eyes and let the 3
symmetrical light-specks do their worst. The distant clock boomed a single 3
stroke. Could it be only one? He flashed the light on his watch and saw that it 3
was precisely that hour. It would be hard indeed waiting for the morning. Rogers 3
would be down at about eight o'clock, ahead of even Orabona. It would be light 3
outside in the main basement long before that, but none of it could penetrate 3
here. All the windows in this basement had been bricked up but the three small 3
ones facing the court. A pretty bad wait, all told. 3
3
His ears were getting most of the hallucinations now-for he could swear he 3
heard stealthy, plodding footsteps in the workroom beyond the closed and 3
locked door. He had no business thinking of that unexhibited horror which 3
Rogers called "It." The thing was a contamination-it had driven its maker mad, 3
and now even its picture was calling up imaginative terrors. It was very 3
obviously beyond that padlocked door of heavy planking. Those steps were 3
certainly pure imagination. 3
3
Then he thought he heard the key turn in the workroom door. Flashing on his 3
torch, he saw nothing but the ancient six-paneled portla in its proper position. 3
Again he tried darkness and closed his eyes, but there followed a harrowing 3
illusion of creaking-not the guillotine this time, but the slow, furtive opening of 3
the workroom door. He would not scream. Once he screamed, he would be lost. 3
There was a sort of padding or shuffling audible now, and it was slowly 3
advancing toward him. He must retain command of himself. Had he not done so 3
when the nameless brain-shaped tried to close in on him? The shuffling crept 3
nearer, and his resolution failed. He did not scream but merely gulped out a 3
challenge. 3
3
"Who goes there? Who are you? What do you want?" 3
3
3
3
617 3
3
3
3
There was no answer, but the shuffling kept on. Jones did not know which he 3
feared most to do-turn on his flashhght or stay in the dark while the thing crept 3
upon him. This thing was different, he felt profoundly, from the other terrors of 3
the evening. His fingers and throat worked spasmodically. Silence was 3
impossible, and the suspense of utter blackness was beginning to be the most 3
intolerable of all conditions. Again he cried out hysterically-"Halt! Who goes 3
there?"-as he switched on the revealing beam of his torch. Then, paralyzed by 3
what he saw, he dropped the flashlight and screamed-not once but many times. 3
3
Shuffling toward him in the darkness was the gigantic, blasphemous form of a 3
black thing not wholly ape and not wholly insect. Its hide hung loosely upon its 3
frame, and its rugose, dead-eyed rudiment of a head swayed drunkenly from 3
side to side. Its forepaws were extended, with talons spread wide, and its whole 3
body was taut with murderous malignity despite its utter lack of facial 3
expression. After the screams and the final coming of darkness it leaped, and in a 3
moment had Jones pinned to the floor. There was no struggle for the watcher had 3
fainted. 3
3
Jones' fainting spell could not have lasted more than a moment, for the nameless 3
thing was apishly dragging him through the darkness when he began recovering 3
consciousness. What started him fully awake were the sounds which the thing 3
was making-or rather, the voice with which it was making them. That voice was 3
human, and it was familiar. Only one living being could be behind the hoarse, 3
feverish accents which were chanting to an unknown horror. 3
3
"la! la!" it was howling. "I am coming, O Rhan-Tegoth, coming with the 3
nourishment. You have waited long and fed ill, but now you shall have what 3
was promised. That and more, for instead of Orabona it will be one of high 3
degree who has doubted you. You shall crush and drain him, with all his doubts, 3
and grow strong thereby. And ever after among men he shall be shown as a 3
monument to your glory. Rhan-Tegoth, infinite and invincible, I am your slave 3
and high-priest. You are hungry, and I shall provide. I read the sign and have led 3
you forth. I shall feed you with blood, and you shall feed me with power. la! 3
Shub-Niggurath! The Goat with a Thousand Young!" 3
3
In an instant all the terrors of the night dropped from Jones like a discarded 3
cloak. He was again master of his mind, for he knew the very earthly and 3
material peril he had to deal with. This was no monster of fable, but a dangerous 3
madman. It was Rogers, dressed in some nightmare covering of his own insane 3
designing, and about to make a frightful sacrifice to the devil-god he had 3
fashioned out of wax. Clearly, he must have entered the workroom from the read 3
courtyard, donned his disguise, and then advance to seize his neatly-trapped and 3
fear-broken victim. His strength was prodigious, and if he was to be thwarted. 3
3
3
3
618 3
3
3
3
one must act quickly. Counting on the madman's confidence in his 3
unconsciousness he determined to take him by surprise, while his grip was 3
relatively lax. The feel of a threshold told him he was crossing into the pitch- 3
black workroom. 3
3
With the strength of mortal fear Jones made a sudden spring from the half- 3
recumbent posture in which he was being dragged. For an instant he was free of 3
the astonished maniac's hands, and in another instant a lucky lunge in the dark 3
had put his own hands at his captor's weirdly concealed throat. Simultaneously 3
Rogers gripped him again, and without further preliminaries the two were 3
locked in a desperate struggle of life and death. Jones' athletic training, without 3
doubt, was his sole salvation; for his mad assailant, freed from every inhibition 3
of fair play, decency, or even self-preservation, was an engine of savage 3
destruction as formidable as a wolf or panther. 3
3
Guttural cries sometimes punctured the hideous tussle in the dark. Blood 3
spurted, clothing ripped, and Jones at last felt the actual throat of the maniac, 3
shorn of its spectral mask. He spoke not a word, but put every ounce of energy 3
into the defence of his life. Rogers kicked, gouged, butted, bit, clawed, and spat- 3
yet found strength to yelp out actual sentences at times. Most of his speech was 3
in a ritualistic jargon full of references to "It" or "Rhan-Tegoth," and to Jones' 3
overwrought nerves it seemed as if the cries echoed from an infinite distance of 3
demoniac snortics and hayings. Toward the last they were rolling on the floor, 3
overturning benches or striking against the walls and the brick foundations of 3
the central melting-furnace. Up to the very end Jones could not be certain of 3
saving himself, but chance finally intervened in his favor. A jab of his knee 3
against Rogers' chest produced a general relaxation, and a moment later he knew 3
he had won. 3
3
Though hardly able to hold himself up, Jones rose and stumbled about the walls 3
seeking the light-switch-for his flashlight was gone, together with most of his 3
clothing. As he lurched along he dragged his limp opponent with him, fearing a 3
sudden attack when the madman came to. Finding the switch-box, he fumbled 3
till he had the right handle. Then, as the wildly disordered workroom burst into 3
sudden radiance, he set about binding Rogers with such cords and belts as he 3
could easily find. The fellow's disguise-or what was left of it-seemed to be made 3
of a puzzling queer sort of leather. For some reason it made Jones' flesh crawl to 3
touch it, and there seemed to be an alien, rusty odor about it. In the normal 3
clothes beneath it was Rogers' key-ring, and this the exhausted victor seized as 3
his final passport to freedom. The shades at the small, slit-like windows were all 3
securely drawn, and he let them remain so. 3
3
3
3
619 3
3
3
3
Washing off the blood of battle at a convenient sink, Jones donned the most 3
ordinary-looking and least ill-fitting clothes he could find on the costume hooks. 3
Testing the door to the courtyard, he found it fastened with a spring-lock which 3
did not require a key from the inside. He kept the key-ring, however, to admit 3
him on his return with aid-for plainly, the thing to do was to call in an alienist. 3
There was no telephone in the museum, but it would not take long to find an all- 3
night restaurant or chemist's shop where one could be had. He had almost 3
opened the door when a torrent of hideous abuse from across the room told him 3
that Rogers-whose visible injuries were confined to a long, deep scratch down 3
the left cheek-had regained consciousness. 3
3
"Fool! Spawn of Noth-Yidik and effluvium of K'thun! Son of the dogs that howl 3
in the maelstrom of Azathoth! You would have been sacred and immortal, and 3
now you are betraying It and Its priest! Beware-for It is hungry! It would have 3
been Orabona-that damned treacherous dog ready to turn against me and It-but 3
I give you the honor instead. Now you must both beware, for It is not gentle 3
without Its priest. 3
3
"la! la! Vengeance is at hand! Do you know you would have been immortal? 3
Look at the furnace! There is a fire ready to light, and there is wax in the kettle. I 3
would have done with you as I have done with other once living forms. Hei! 3
You, who have vowed all my effigies are waxen, would have become a waxen 3
effigy yourself! The furnace was already! When It had had its fill, and you were 3
like that dog I showed you, I would have made your flattened, punctured 3
fragments immortal! Wax would have done it. Haven't you said I'm a great 3
artist? Wax in every pore-wax over every square inch of you-Ia! la! And ever 3
after the world would have looked at your mangled carcass and wondered how I 3
ever imagined and made such a thing! Hei! and Orabona would have come next, 3
and others after him-and thus would my waxen family have grown! 3
3
"Dog-do you still thing I made all my effigies? Why not say preserved? You 3
know by this time the strange places I've been to, and the strange things I've 3
brought back. Coward-you could never face the dimensional shambler whose 3
hide I put on to scare you-the mere sight of it alive, or even the full-fledged 3
thought of it, would kill you instantly with fright! la! la! It waits hungry for the 3
blood that is the life!" 3
3
Rogers, propped against the wall, swayed to and fro in his bonds. 3
3
"See here, Jones-if I let you go will you let me go? It must be taken care of by Its 3
high priest. Orabona will be enough to keep It alive-and when he is finished I 3
will make his fragments immortal in wax for the world to see. It could have been 3
you, but you have rejected the honor. I won't bother you again. Let me go, and I 3
3
3
3
620 3
3
3
3
will share with you the power that It will bring me. la! la! Great is Rhan-Tegoth! 3
Let me go! Let me go! It is starving down there beyond that door, and if It dies 3
the Old Ones can never come back. Hei! Hei! Let me go!" 3
3
Jones merely shook his head, though the hideousness of the showman's 3
imaginings revolted him. Rogers, now staring wildly at the padlocked plank 3
door, thumped his head again and again against the brick wall and kicked with 3
his tightly bound ankles. Jones was afraid he would injure himself, and 3
advanced to bind him more firmly to some stationary object. Writhing, Rogers 3
edged away from him and set up a series of frenetic ululations whose utter, 3
monstrous unhumanness was appalling, and whose sheer volume was almost 3
incredible. It seemed impossible that any human throat could produce noises so 3
loud and piercing, and Jones felt that if this continued there would be no need to 3
telephone for aid. It could not be long before a constable would investigate, even 3
granting that there were no listening neighbors in this deserted warehouse 3
district. 3
3
"Wza-y'ei! Wza-y'ei!" howled the madman. "Y'kaa haa ho-ii, Rhan-Tegoth- 3
Cthulhu fthagn-Ei! Ei! Ei! Ei!-Rhan-Teogth. Rhan-Tegoth, Rhan-Tegoth!" 3
3
The tautly trussed creature, who had started squirming his way across the 3
littered floor, now reached the padlocked plank door and commenced knocking 3
his head thunderously against it. Jones dreaded the task of binding him further, 3
and wished he were not so exhausted from his previous struggle. This violent 3
aftermath was getting hideously on his nerves, and he began to feel a return of 3
the nameless qualms he had felt in the dark. Everything about Rogers and his 3
museum was so hellishly morbid and suggestive of black vistas beyond life! It 3
was loathsome to think of the waxen masterpiece of abnormal genius which 3
must at this very moment be lurking close at hand in the blackness beyond the 3
heavy, padlocked door. 3
3
At now something happened which sent an addition chill down Jones' spine, and 3
caused every hair-even the tiny growth on the backs of his hands-to bristle with 3
a vague fright beyond classification. Rogers had suddenly stopped screaming 3
and beating his head against the stout plank door, and was straining up to a 3
sitting position, head cocked on one side as if listening intently for something. 3
All at once a smile of devilish triumph overspread his face, and he began 3
speaking intelligibly again-this time in a hoarse whisper contrasting oddly with 3
his former stentorian howling. 3
3
"Listen, fool! Listen hard! It has heard me, and is coming. Can't you hear It 3
splashing out of Its tank down there at the end of the runway? I dug it deep, 3
because there was nothing too good for It. It is amphibious, you know-you saw 3
3
3
3
621 3
3
3
3
the gills in the picture. It came to the earth from lead-gray Yuggoth, where the 3
cities are under the warm deep sea. It can't stand up in there-too tail-has to sit 3
down or crouch. Let me get my keys-we must let It out and kneel down before it. 3
Then we will go out and find a dog or cat-or perhaps a drunken man-to give It 3
the nourishment It needs." 3
3
It was not what the madman said, but the way he said it, that disorganized Jones 3
so badly. The utter, insane confidence and sincerity in that crazed whisper were 3
damnably contagious. Imagination, such a stimulus, could find an active menace 3
in the devilish wax figure that lurked unseen just beyond the heavy planking. 3
Eyeing the door in unholy fascination, Jones notices that it bore several distinct 3
cracks, though no marks of violent treatment were visible on this side. He 3
wondered how large a room or closet lay behind it, and how the waxen figure 3
was arranged. The maniac's idea of a tank and runway was as clever as all his 3
other imaginings. 3
3
Then, in one terrible instant, Jones completely lost the power to draw a breath. 3
The leather belt he had seized for Rogers' further strapping fell from his limp 3
hands, and a spasm of shivering convulsed him from head to foot. He might 3
have known the place would drive him mad as it had driven Rogers-and now he 3
was mad. He was mad, for he now harbored hallucinations more weird than any 3
which had assailed him earlier that night. The madman was bidding him hear 3
the splashing of a mythical monster in a tank beyond the door-and now, God 3
help him, he did hear it! 3
3
Rogers saw the spasm of horror reach Jones' face and transform it to a staring 3
mask of fear. He cackled. 3
3
"At last, fool, you believe! At last you know! You hear It and It comes! Get me 3
my keys, fool-we must do homage and serve It!" 3
3
But Jones was past paying attention to any human words, mad or sane. Phobic 3
paralysis held him immobile and half conscious, with wild images racing 3
fantasmagorically though his helpless imagination. There was a splashing. There 3
was padding or shuffling, as of great wet paws on a solid surface. Something was 3
approaching. Into his nostrils, from the cracks in that nightmare plank door, 3
poured a noisome animal stench like and yet unlike that of the mammal cages at 3
the zoological gardens in Regent's Park. 3
3
He did not known where Rogers was talking or not. Everything real had faded 3
away, and he was a statue obsessed with dreams and hallucinations so unnatural 3
that they became almost objective and remote from him. He thought he heard a 3
sniffing or snorting from the unknown gulf beyond the door, and when a sudden 3
3
3
3
622 3
3
3
3
baying, trumpeting noise assailed his ears he could not feel sure that it came 3
from the tightly bound maniac whose image swam uncertainly in his shaken 3
vision. The photograph of that accursed, unseen wax thing persisted in floating 3
through his consciousness. Such a thing had no right to exist. Had it not driven 3
him mad? 3
3
Even as he reflected, a fresh evidence of madness beset him. Something, he 3
thought, was fumbling with the latch of the heavy padlocked door. It was patting 3
and pawing and pushing at the planks. There was a thudding on the stout wood, 3
which grew louder and louder. The stench was horrible. And now the assault on 3
that door from the inside was a malign, determined pounding like the strokes of 3
a battering-ram. There was an ominous cracking-a splintering-a welling fetor-a 3
falling plank-a black paw ending in a crab-like claw. . . . 3
3
"Help! Help! God help me! . . . Aaaaaaa! . . ." 3
3
With intense effort Jones is today able to recall a sudden bursting of his fear- 3
paralysis into the liberation of frenzied automatic flight. What he evidently did 3
must have paralleled curiously the wild, plunging flights of maddest nightmares; 3
for he seems to have leaped across the disordered crypt at almost a single bound, 3
yanked open the outside door, which closed and locked itself after him with a 3
clatter, sprung up the worn stone steps three at a time, and raced frantically and 3
aimlessly out of that dark cobblestoned court and through the squalid streets of 3
Southwark. 3
3
Here the memory ends. Jones does not know how he got home, and there is no 3
evidence of his having hired a cab. Probably he raced all the way by blind 3
instinct-over Waterloo Bridge, along the Strand and Charing Cross and up 3
Haymarket and Regent Street to his own neighborhood. He still had on the queer 3
melange of museum costumes when he grew conscious enough to call the 3
doctor. 3
3
A week later the nerve specialists allowed him to leave his bed and walk in the 3
open air. 3
3
But he had not told the specialists much. Over his whole experience hung a pall 3
of madness and nightmare, and he felt that silence was the only course. When he 3
was up, he scanned intently all the papers which had accumulated since that 3
hideous night, but found no reference to anything queer at the museum. How 3
much, after all, had been reality? Where did reality end and morbid dream 3
begin? Had his mind gone wholly to pieces in that dark exhibition chamber, and 3
had the whole fight with Rogers been a fantasm of fever? It would help to put 3
him on his feet if he could settle some of these maddening points. He must have 3
3
3
3
623 3
3
3
3
seen that damnable photograph of the wax image called "It," for no brain but 3
Rogers' could ever have conceived such a blasphemy. 3
3
It was a fortnight before he dared to enter Southwark Street again. He went in 3
the middle of the morning, when there was the greatest amount of sane, 3
wholesome activity around the ancient, crumbling shops and warehouses. The 3
museum's sign was still there, and as he approached he saw that the place was 3
still open. The gateman nodded in pleasant recognition as he summoned up the 3
courage to enter, and in the vaulted chamber below an attendant touched his cap 3
cheerfully. Perhaps everything had been a dream. Would he dare to knock at the 3
door of the workroom and look for Rogers? 3
3
Then Orabona advanced to greet him. His dark, sleek face was a trifle sardonic, 3
but Jones felt that he was not unfriendly. He spoke with a trace of accent. 3
3
"Good morning, Mr. Jones. It is some time since we have seen you here. Did you 3
wish Mr. Rogers? I'm sorry, but he is away. He had word of business in America, 3
and had to go. Yes, it was very sudden. I am in charge now-here, and at the 3
house. I try to maintain Mr. Rogers' high standard-till he is back." 3
3
The foreigner smiled-perhaps from affability alone. Jones scarcely knew how to 3
reply, but managed to mumble out a few inquiries about the day after his last 3
visit. Orabona seemed greatly amused by the questions, and took considerable 3
care in framing his replies. 3
3
"Oh, yes, Mr. Jones-the 28th of last month. I remember it for many reasons. In 3
the morning-before Mr. Rogers got here, you understand-I found the workroom 3
in quite a mess. There was a great deal of-cleaning up-to do. There had been- 3
late work, you see. Important new specimen given its secondary baking process. 3
I took complete charge when I came. 3
3
"It was a hard specimen to prepare-but of course Mr. Rogers had taught me a 3
great deal. He is, as you know, a very great artist. When he came he helped me 3
complete the specimen-helped very materially, I assure you-but he left soon 3
without even greeting the men. As I tell you, he was called away suddenly. 3
There were important chemical reactions involved. They made loud noises-in 3
fact, some teamsters in the court outside fancy they heard several pistol shots- 3
very amusing idea! 3
3
"As for the new specimen-that matter is very unforutnate. It is a great 3
masterpiece-designed and made, you understand, by Mr. Rogers. He will see 3
about it when he gets back." 3
3
3
3
624 3
3
3
3
Again Orabona smiled. 3
3
"The police, you know. We put it on display a week ago, and there were two or 3
three faintings. One poor fellow had an epileptic fit in front of it. You see, it a 3
trifle-stronger-than the rest. Larger, for one thing. Of course, it was in the adult 3
alcove. The next day a couple of men from Scotland Yard looked it over and said 3
it was too morbid to be shown. Said we'd have to remove it. It was a tremendous 3
shame-such a masterpiece of art-but I didn't deel justified in appealing to the 3
courts in Mr. Rogers' absence. He would not like so much publicity with the 3
police now-but when he gets back-when he gets back-." 3
3
For some reason or other Jones felt a mounting tide of uneasiness and repulsion. 3
But Orabona was continuing. 3
3
"You are a connoisseur, Mr. Jones. I am sure I violate no law in offering you a 3
private view. It may be-subject of course, to Mr. Rogers' wishes-that we shall 3
destroy the specimen some day-but that would be a crime." 3
3
Jones had a powerful impulse to refuse the sight and flee precipitately, but 3
Orabona was leading him forward by the arm with an artist's enthusiasm. The 3
adult alcove, crowded with nameless horrors, held no visitors. In the farther 3
corner a large niche had been curtained off, and to this the smiling assistant 3
advanced. 3
3
"You must know, Mr. Jones, that the title of this specimen is 'The Sacrifice to 3
Rhan-Tegoth.' " 3
3
Jones started violently, but Orabona appeared not to notice. 3
3
"The shapeless, colossal god is a feature in certain obscure legends which Mr. 3
Rogers had studied. All nonsense, of course, as you've so often assured Mr. 3
Rogers. It is supposed to have come from outer space, and to have lived in the 3
Arctic three million years ago. It trated its sacrifices rather peculiarly and 3
horribly, as you shall see. Mr. Rogers had made it fiendishly life-like-even to the 3
face of the victim." 3
3
Now trembling violently, Jones clund to the brass railing in front of the curtained 3
niche. He almost reached out to stop Orabona when he saw the curtain 3
beginning to swing aside, but some conflicting impulse held him back. The 3
foreigner smiled triumphantly. 3
3
"Behold!" 3
3
Jones reeled in spite of his grip on the railing. 3
3
625 3
3
3
3
"God!-great god!" 3
3
Fully ten feet high despite a shambling, crouching attitude expressive of infinite 3
cosmic malignancy, a monstrosity of unbelievable horror was shown starting 3
forward from a Cyclopean ivory throne covered with grotesque carvings. In the 3
central pair of its six legs it bore a crushed, flattened, distorted, bloodless thing, 3
riddled with a million punctures, and in places seared as with some pungent 3
acid. Only the mangled head of the victim, lolling upside down at one side, 3
revealed that it represented something once human. 3
3
The monster itself needed no title for one who had seen a certain hellish 3
photograph. That damnable print had been all too faithful; yet it could not carry 3
the full horror which lay in the gigantic actuality. The globular torso-the bubble- 3
like suggestion of a head-the three fishy eyes-the foot-long proboscis-the 3
bulging gills-the monstrous capillation of asp-like suckers-the six sinuous limbs 3
with their black paws and crab-like claws-God! the familiarity of the black paw 3
ending in a crab-like claw! . . . 3
3
Orabona's smile was utterly damnable. Jones choked, and stared at the hideous 3
exhibit with a mounting fascination which perplexed and disturbed him. What 3
half-revealed horror was holding and forcing him to look longer and search out 3
details? This had driven Rogers mad . . . Rogers, supreme artist . . . said they 3
weren't artificial. . . . 3
3
Then he localized the thing that held him. It was the crushed waxen victim's 3
lolling head, and something that it implied. This head was not entirely devoid of 3
a face, and that face was familiar. It was like the mad face of poor Rogers. Jones 3
peered closer, hardly knowing why he was driven to do so. Wasn't it natural for 3
a mad egotist to mold his own features into his masterpiece? Was there anything 3
more that subconscious vision had seized on and suppressed in sheer terror? 3
3
The wax of the mangled face had been handled with boundless dexterity. Those 3
punctures-how perfectly they reproduced the myriad wounds somehow 3
inflicted on that poor dog! But there was something more. On the left cheek one 3
could trace an irregularity which seemed outside the general scheme-as if the 3
sculptor had sought to cover up a defect of his first modelling. The more Jones 3
looked at it, the more mysteriously it horrified him-and then, suddenly, he 3
remembered a circumstance which brought his horror to a head. That night of 3
hideousness-the tussle-the bound madman-and the long, deep scratch down the 3
left cheek of the actual living Rogers. . . . 3
3
Jones, releasing his desperate clutch on the railing, sank in a total faint. 3
3
3
3
626 3
3
3
3
Orabona continued to smile. 3

The Hound 3
3
3
3
Written in September of 1922 3
3
Published in February of 1924 in Weird Tales 3
3
In my tortured ears there sounds unceasingly a nightmare whirring and 3
flapping, and a faint distant baying as of some gigantic hound. It is not dream - it 3
is not, I fear, even madness - for too much has already happened to give me these 3
merciful doubts. 3
3
St John is a mangled corpse; I alone know why, and such is my knowledge that I 3
am about to blow out my brains for fear I shall be mangled in the same way. 3
Down unlit and illimitable corridors of eldrith phantasy sweeps the black, 3
shapeless Nemesis that drives me to self-annihilation. 3
3
May heaven forgive the folly and morbidity which led us both to so monstrous a 3
fate! Wearied with the commonplaces of a prosaic world; where even the joys of 3
romance and adventure soon grow stale, St John and I had followed 3
enthusiastically every aesthetic and intellectual movement which promised 3
respite from our devastating ennui. The enigmas of the symbolists and the 3
ecstasies of the pre-Raphaelites all were ours in their time, but each new mood 3
was drained too soon, of its diverting novelty and appeal. 3
3
Only the somber philosophy of the decadents could help us, and this we found 3
potent only by increasing gradually the depth and diabolism of our penetrations. 3
Baudelaire and Huysmans were soon exhausted of thrills, till finally there 3
remained for us only the more direct stimuli of unnatural personal experiences 3
and adventures. It was this frightful emotional need which led us eventually to 3
that detestable course which even in my present fear I mention with shame and 3
timidity - that hideous extremity of human outrage, the abhorred practice of 3
grave-robbing. 3
3
I cannot reveal the details of our shocking expeditions, or catalogue even partly 3
the worst of the trophies adorning the nameless museum we prepared in the 3
great stone house where we jointly dwelt, alone and servantless. Our museum 3
was a blasphemous, unthinkable place, where with the satanic taste of neurotic 3
virtuosi we had assembled an universe of terror and decay to excite our jaded 3
sensibilities. It was a secret room, far, far, underground; where huge winged 3
daemons carven of basalt and onyx vomited from wide grinning mouths weird 3
green and orange light, and hidden pneumatic pipes ruffled into kaleidoscopic 3
dances of death the lines of red charnel things hand in hand woven in 3
3
3
3
628 3
3
3
3
voluminous black hangings. Through these pipes came at will the odors our 3
moods most craved; sometimes the scent of pale funeral lilies; sometimes the 3
narcotic incense of imagined Eastern shrines of the kingly dead, and sometimes - 3
how I shudder to recall it! - the frightful, soul-upheaving stenches of the 3
uncovered-grave. 3
3
Around the walls of this repellent chamber were cases of antique mummies 3
alternating with comely, lifelike bodies perfectly stuffed and cured by the 3
taxidermist's art, and with headstones snatched from the oldest churchyards of 3
the world. Niches here and there contained skulls of all shapes, and heads 3
preserved in various stages of dissolution. There one might find the rotting, bald 3
pates of famous noblemen, and the fresh and radiantly golden heads of new- 3
buried children. 3
3
Statues and paintings there were, all of fiendish subjects and some executed by St 3
John and myself. A locked portfolio, bound in tanned human skin, held certain 3
unknown and unnameable drawings which it was rumored Goya had 3
perpetrated but dared not acknowledge. There were nauseous musical 3
instruments, stringed, brass, and wood-wind, on which St John and I sometimes 3
produced dissonances of exquisite morbidity and cacodaemoniacal ghastliness; 3
whilst in a multitude of inlaid ebony cabinets reposed the most incredible and 3
unimaginable variety of tomb-loot ever assembled by human madness and 3
perversity. It is of this loot in particular that I must not speak - thank God I had 3
the courage to destroy it long before I thought of destroying myself! 3
3
The predatory excursions on which we collected our unmentionable treasures 3
were always artistically memorable events. We were no vulgar ghouls, but 3
worked only under certain conditions of mood, landscape, environment, 3
weather, season, and moonlight. These pastimes were to us the most exquisite 3
form of aesthetic expression, and we gave their details a fastidious technical care. 3
An inappropriate hour, a jarring lighting effect, or a clumsy manipulation of the 3
damp sod, would almost totally destroy for us that ecstatic titillation which 3
followed the exhumation of some ominous, grinning secret of the earth. Our 3
quest for novel scenes and piquant conditions was feverish and insatiate - St John 3
was always the leader, and he it was who led the way at last to that mocking, 3
accursed spot which brought us our hideous and inevitable doom. 3
3
By what malign fatality were we lured to that terrible Holland churchyard? I 3
think it was the dark rumor and legendry, the tales of one buried for five 3
centuries, who had himself been a ghoul in his time and had stolen a potent 3
thing from a mighty sepulchre. I can recall the scene in these final moments - the 3
pale autumnal moon over the graves, casting long horrible shadows; the 3
grotesque trees, drooping sullenly to meet the neglected grass and the crumbling 3
3
3
3
629 3
3
3
3
slabs; the vast legions of strangely colossal bats that flew against the moon; the 3
antique ivied church pointing a huge spectral finger at the livid sky; the 3
phosphorescent insects that danced like death-fires under the yews in a distant 3
corner; the odors of mould, vegetation, and less explicable things that mingled 3
feebly with the night-wind from over far swamps and seas; and, worst of all, the 3
faint deep-toned baying of some gigantic hound which we could neither see nor 3
definitely place. As we heard this suggestion of baying we shuddered, 3
remembering the tales of the peasantry; for he whom we sought had centuries 3
before been found in this self same spot, torn and mangled by the claws and 3
teeth of some unspeakable beast. 3
3
I remember how we delved in the ghoul's grave with our spades, and how we 3
thrilled at the picture of ourselves, the grave, the pale watching moon, the 3
horrible shadows, the grotesque trees, the titanic bats, the antique church, the 3
dancing death-fires, the sickening odors, the gently moaning night-wind, and the 3
strange, half-heard directionless baying of whose objective existence we could 3
scarcely be sure. 3
3
Then we struck a substance harder than the damp mould, and beheld a rotting 3
oblong box crusted with mineral deposits from the long undisturbed ground. It 3
was incredibly tough and thick, but so old that we finally pried it open and 3
feasted our eyes on what it held. 3
3
Much - amazingly much - was left of the object despite the lapse of five hundred 3
years. The skeleton, though crushed in places by the jaws of the thing that had 3
killed it, held together with surprising firmness, and we gloated over the clean 3
white skull and its long, firm teeth and its eyeless sockets that once had glowed 3
with a charnel fever like our own. In the coffin lay an amulet of curious and 3
exotic design, which had apparently been worn around the sleeper's neck. It was 3
the oddly conventionalised figure of a crouching winged hound, or sphinx with 3
a semi-canine face, and was exquisitely carved in antique Oriental fashion from a 3
small piece of green jade. The expression of its features was repellent in the 3
extreme, savoring at once of death, bestiality and malevolence. Around the base 3
was an inscription in characters which neither St John nor I could identify; and 3
on the bottom, like a maker's seal, was graven a grotesque and formidable skull. 3
3
Immediately upon beholding this amulet we knew that we must possess it; that 3
this treasure alone was our logical pelf from the centuried grave. Even had its 3
outlines been unfamiliar we would have desired it, but as we looked more 3
closely we saw that it was not wholly unfamiliar. Alien it indeed was to all art 3
and literature which sane and balanced readers know, but we recognized it as 3
the thing hinted of in the forbidden Necronomicon of the mad Arab Abdul 3
Alhazred; the ghastly soul-symbol of the corpse-eating cult of inaccessible Leng, 3
3
3
3
630 3
3
3
3
in Central Asia. All too well did we trace the sinister lineaments described by the 3
old Arab daemonologist; lineaments, he wrote, drawn from some obscure 3
supernatural manifestation of the souls of those who vexed and gnawed at the 3
dead. 3
3
Seizing the green jade object, we gave a last glance at the bleached and cavern- 3
eyed face of its owner and closed up the grave as we found it. As we hastened 3
from the abhorrent spot, the stolen amulet in St John's pocket, we thought we 3
saw the bats descend in a body to the earth we had so lately rifled, as if seeking 3
for some cursed and unholy nourishment. But the autumn moon shone weak 3
and pale, and we could not be sure. 3
3
So, too, as we sailed the next day away from Holland to our home, we thought 3
we heard the faint distant baying of some gigantic hound in the background. But 3
the autumn wind moaned sad and wan, and we could not be sure. 3
3
Less than a week after our return to England, strange things began to happen. 3
We lived as recluses; devoid of friends, alone, and without servants in a few 3
rooms of an ancient manor-house on a bleak and unfrequented moor; so that our 3
doors were seldom disturbed by the knock of the visitor. 3
3
Now, however, we were troubled by what seemed to be a frequent fumbling in 3
the night, not only around the doors but around the windows also, upper as well 3
as lower. Once we fancied that a large, opaque body darkened the library 3
window when the moon was shining against it, and another time we thought we 3
heard a whirring or flapping sound not far off. On each occasion investigation 3
revealed nothing, and we began to ascribe the occurrences to imagination which 3
still prolonged in our ears the faint far baying we thought we had heard in the 3
Holland churchyard. The jade amulet now reposed in a niche in our museum, 3
and sometimes we burned a strangely scented candle before it. We read much in 3
Alhazred's Necronomicon about its properties, and about the relation of ghosts' 3
souls to the objects it symbolized; and were disturbed by what we read. 3
3
Then terror came. 3
3
On the night of September 24, 19-, I heard a knock at my chamber door. 3
Fancying it St John's, I bade the knocker enter, but was answered only by a shrill 3
laugh. There was no one in the corridor. When I aroused St John from his sleep, 3
he professed entire ignorance of the event, and became as worried as I. It was the 3
night that the faint, distant baying over the moor became to us a certain and 3
dreaded reality. 3
3
3
3
631 3
3
3
3
Four days later, whilst we were both in the hidden museum, there came a low, 3
cautious scratching at the single door which led to the secret library staircase. 3
Our alarm was now divided, for, besides our fear of the unknown, we had 3
always entertained a dread that our grisly collection might be discovered. 3
Extinguishing all lights, we proceeded to the door and threw it suddenly open; 3
whereupon we felt an unaccountable rush of air, and heard, as if receding far 3
away, a queer combination of rustling, tittering, and articulate chatter. Whether 3
we were mad, dreaming, or in our senses, we did not try to determine. We only 3
realized, with the blackest of apprehensions, that the apparently disembodied 3
chatter was beyond a doubt in the Dutch language. 3
3
After that we lived in growing horror and fascination. Mostly we held to the 3
theory that we were jointly going mad from our life of unnatural excitements, 3
but sometimes it pleased us more to dramatize ourselves as the victims of some 3
creeping and appalling doom. Bizarre manifestations were now too frequent to 3
count. Our lonely house was seemingly alive with the presence of some malign 3
being whose nature we could not guess, and every night that daemoniac baying 3
rolled over the wind-swept moor, always louder and louder. On October 29 we 3
found in the soft earth underneath the library window a series of footprints 3
utterly impossible to describe. They were as baffling as the hordes of great bats 3
which haunted the old manor-house in unprecedented and increasing numbers. 3
3
The horror reached a culmination on November 18, when St John, walking home 3
after dark from the dismal railway station, was seized by some frightful 3
carnivorous thing and torn to ribbons. His screams had reached the house, and I 3
had hastened to the terrible scene in time to hear a whir of wings and see a vague 3
black cloudy thing silhouetted against the rising moon. 3
3
My friend was dying when I spoke to him, and he could not answer coherently. 3
All he could do was to whisper, "The amulet - that damned thing -" 3
3
Then he collapsed, an inert mass of mangled flesh. 3
3
I buried him the next midnight in one of our neglected gardens, and mumbled 3
over his body one of the devilish rituals he had loved in life. And as I 3
pronounced the last daemoniac sentence I heard afar on the moor the faint 3
baying of some gigantic hound. The moon was up, but I dared not look at it. And 3
when I saw on the dim-lighted moor a wide-nebulous shadow sweeping from 3
mound to mound, I shut my eyes and threw myself face down upon the ground. 3
When I arose, trembling, I know not how much later, I staggered into the house 3
and made shocking obeisances before the enshrined amulet of green jade. 3
3
3
3
632 3
3
3
3
Being now afraid to live alone in the ancient house on the moor, I departed on 3
the following day for London, taking with me the amulet after destroying by fire 3
and burial the rest of the impious collection in the museum. But after three nights 3
I heard the baying again, and before a week was over felt strange eyes upon me 3
whenever it was dark. One evening as I strolled on Victoria Embankment for 3
some needed air, I saw a black shape obscure one of the reflections of the lamps 3
in the water. A wind, stronger than the night-wind, rushed by, and I knew that 3
what had befallen St John must soon befall me. 3
3
The next day I carefully wrapped the green jade amulet and sailed for Holland. 3
What mercy I might gain by returning the thing to its silent, sleeping owner I 3
knew not; but I felt that I must try any step conceivably logical. What the hound 3
was, and why it had pursued me, were questions still vague; but I had first heard 3
the baying in that ancient churchyard, and every subsequent event including St 3
John's dying whisper had served to connect the curse with the stealing of the 3
amulet. Accordingly I sank into the nethermost abysses of despair when, at an 3
inn in Rotterdam, I discovered that thieves had despoiled me of this sole means 3
of salvation. 3
3
The baying was loud that evening, and in the morning I read of a nameless deed 3
in the vilest quarter of the city. The rabble were in terror, for upon an evil 3
tenement had fallen a red death beyond the foulest previous crime of the 3
neighborhood. In a squalid thieves' den an entire family had been torn to shreds 3
by an unknown thing which left no trace, and those around had heard all night a 3
faint, deep, insistent note as of a gigantic hound. 3
3
So at last I stood again in the unwholesome churchyard where a pale winter 3
moon cast hideous shadows and leafless trees drooped sullenly to meet the 3
withered, frosty grass and cracking slabs, and the ivied church pointed a jeering 3
finger at the unfriendly sky, and the night-wind howled maniacally from over 3
frozen swamps and frigid seas. The baying was very faint now, and it ceased 3
altogether as I approached the ancient grave I had once violated, and frightened 3
away an abnormally large horde of bats which had been hovering curiously 3
around it. 3
3
I know not why I went thither unless to pray, or gibber out insane pleas and 3
apologies to the calm white thing that lay within; but, whatever my reason, I 3
attacked the half frozen sod with a desperation partly mine and partly that of a 3
dominating will outside myself. Excavation was much easier than I expected, 3
though at one point I encountered a queer interruption; when a lean vulture 3
darted down out of the cold sky and pecked frantically at the grave-earth until I 3
killed him with a blow of my spade. Finally I reached the rotting oblong box and 3
removed the damp nitrous cover. This is the last rational act I ever performed. 3
3
3
3
633 3
3
3
3
For crouched within that centuried coffin, embraced by a closepacked nightmare 3
retinue of huge, sinewy, sleeping bats, was the bony thing my friend and I had 3
robbed; not clean and placid as we had seen it then, but covered with caked 3
blood and shreds of alien flesh and hair, and leering sentiently at me with 3
phosphorescent sockets and sharp ensanguined fangs yawning twistedly in 3
mockery of my inevitable doom. And when it gave from those grinning jaws a 3
deep, sardonic bay as of some gigantic hound, and I saw that it held in its gory 3
filthy claw the lost and fateful amulet of green jade, I merely screamed and ran 3
away idiotically, my screams soon dissolving into peals of hysterical laughter. 3
3
Madness rides the star-wind... claws and teeth sharpened on centuries of 3
corpses... dripping death astride a bacchanale of bats from nigh-black ruins of 3
buried temples of Belial. . . Now, as the baying of that dead fleshless monstrosity 3
grows louder and louder, and the stealthy whirring and flapping of those 3
accursed web-wings closer and closer, I shall seek with my revolver the oblivion 3
which is my only refuge from the unnamed and unnameable. 3

The Music OF Erich Zann 3
3
Written in December of 1921 3
3
Published in March of 1922 in The National Amateur 3
3
I have examined maps of the city with the greatest care, yet have never again 3
found the Rue d'Auseil. These maps have not been modern maps alone, for I 3
know that names change. I have, on the contrary, delved deeply into all the 3
antiquities of the place, and have personally explored every region, of whatever 3
name, which could possibly answer to the street I knew as the Rue d'Auseil. But 3
despite all I have done, it remains an humiliating fact that I cannot find the 3
house, the street, or even the locality, where, during the last months of my 3
impoverished life as a student of metaphysics at the university, I heard the music 3
of Erich Zann. 3
3
That my memory is broken, I do not wonder; for my health, physical and mental, 3
was gravely disturbed throughout the period of my residence in the Rue 3
d'Auseil, and I recall that I took none of my few acquaintances there. But that I 3
cannot find the place again is both singular and perplexing; for it was within a 3
half-hour's walk of the university and was distinguished by peculiarities which 3
could hardly be forgotten by any one who had been there. I have never met a 3
person who has seen the Rue d'Auseil. 3
3
The Rue d'Auseil lay across a dark river bordered by precipitous brick blear- 3
windowed warehouses and spanned by a ponderous bridge of dark stone. It was 3
always shadowy along that river, as if the smoke of neighboring factories shut 3
out the sun perpetually. The river was also odorous with evil stenches which I 3
have never smelled elsewhere, and which may some day help me to find it, since 3
I should recognize them at once. Beyond the bridge were narrow cobbled streets 3
with rails; and then came the ascent, at first gradual, but incredibly steep as the 3
Rue d'Auseil was reached. 3
3
I have never seen another street as narrow and steep as the Rue d'Auseil. It was 3
almost a cliff, closed to all vehicles, consisting in several places of ffights of steps, 3
and ending at the top in a lofty ivied wall. Its paving was irregular, sometimes 3
stone slabs, sometimes cobblestones, and sometimes bare earth with struggling 3
greenish-grey vegetation. The houses were tall, peaked-roofed, incredibly old, 3
and crazily leaning backward, forward, and sidewise. Occasionally an opposite 3
pair, both leaning forward, almost met across the street like an arch; and 3
certainly they kept most of the light from the ground below. There were a few 3
overhead bridges from house to house across the street. 3
3
3
3
635 3
3
3
3
The inhabitants of that street impressed me pecuharly; At first I thought it was 3
because they were all silent and reticent; but later decided it was because they 3
were all very old. I do not know how I came to live on such a street, but I was not 3
myself when I moved there. I had been living in many poor places, always 3
evicted for want of money; until at last I came upon that tottering house in the 3
Rue d'Auseil kept by the paralytic Blandot. It was the third house from the top of 3
the street, and by far the tallest of them all. 3
3
My rcom was on the fifth story; the only inhabited room there, since the house 3
was almost empty. On the night I arrived I heard Strang music from the peaked 3
garret overhead, and the next day asked old Blandot about it. He told me it was 3
an old German viol-player, a strange dumb man who signed his name as Erich 3
Zann, and who played eve nings in a cheap theater orchestra; adding that Zann's 3
desire to play in the night after his return from the theater was the reason he had 3
chosen this lofty and isolated garret room, whose single gable window was the 3
only point on the street from which one could look over the terminating wall at 3
the declivity and panorama beyond. 3
3
Thereafter I heard Zann every night, and although he kept me awake, I was 3
haunted by the weirdness of his music. Knowing little of the art myself, I was yet 3
certain that none of his harmonies had any relation to music I had heard before; 3
and concluded that he was a composer of highly original genius. The longer I 3
listened, the more I was fascinated, until after a week I resolved to make the old 3
man's acquaintance. 3
3
One night as he was returning from his work, I intercepted Zann in the hallway 3
and told him that I would like to know him and be with him when he played. He 3
was a small, lean, bent person, with shabby clothes, blue eyes, grotesque, 3
satyrlike face, and nearly bald head; and at my first words seemed both angered 3
and frightened. My obvious friendliness, however, finally melted him; and he 3
grudgingly motioned to me to follow him up the dark, creaking and rickety attic 3
stairs. His room, one of only two in the steeply pitched garret, was on the west 3
side, toward the high wall that formed the upper end of the street. Its size was 3
very great, and seemed the greater because of its extraordinary barrenness and 3
neglect. Of furniture there was only a narrow iron bedstead, a dingy wash-stand, 3
a small table, a large bookcase, an iron music-rack, and three old-fashioned 3
chairs. Sheets of music were piled in disorder about the floor. The walls were of 3
bare boards, and had probably never known plaster; whilst the abundance of 3
dust and cobwebs made the place seem more deserted than inhabited. Evidently 3
Erich Zann's world of beauty lay in some far cosmos of the imagination. 3
3
Motioning me to sit down, the dumb man closed the door, turned the large 3
wooden bolt, and lighted a candle to augment the one he had brought with him. 3

3
He now removed his viol from its motheaten covering, and taking it, seated 3
himself in the least uncomfortable of the chairs. He did not employ the music- 3
rack, but, offering no choice and playing from memory, enchanted me for over 3
an hour with strains I had never heard before; strains which must have been of 3
his own devising. To describe their exact nature is impossible for one unversed 3
in music. They were a kind of fugue, with recurrent passages of the most 3
captivating quality, but to me were notable for the absence of any of the weird 3
notes I had overheard from my room below on other occasions. 3
3
Those haunting notes I had remembered, and had often hummed and whistled 3
inaccurately to myself, so when the player at length laid down his bow I asked 3
him if he would render some of them. As I began my request the wrinkled 3
satyrlike face lost the bored placidity it had possessed during the playing, and 3
seemed to show the same curious mixture of anger and fright which I had 3
noticed when first I accosted the old man. For a moment I was inclined to use 3
persuasion, regarding rather lightly the whims of senility; and even tried to 3
awaken my host's weirder mood by whistling a few of the strains to which I had 3
listened the night before. But I did not pursue this course for more than a 3
moment; for when the dumb musician recognized the whistled air his face grew 3
suddenly distorted with an expression wholly beyond analysis, and his long, 3
cold, bony right hand reached out to stop my mouth and silence the crude 3
imitation. As he did this he further demonstrated his eccentricity by casting a 3
startled glance toward the lone curtained window, as if fearful of some 3
intruder— a glance doubly absurd, since the garret stood high and inaccessible 3
above all the adjacent roofs, this window being the only point on the steep street, 3
as the concierge had told me, from which one could see over the wall at the 3
summit. 3
3
The old man's glance brought Blandot's remark to my mind, and with a certain 3
capriciousness I felt a wish to look out over the wide and dizzying panorama of 3
moonlit roofs and city lights beyond the hilltop, which of all the dwellers in the 3
Rue d'Auseil only this crabbed musician could see. I moved toward the window 3
and would have drawn aside the nondescript curtains, when with a frightened 3
rage even greater than before, the dumb lodger was upon me again; this time 3
motioning with his head toward the door as he nervously strove to drag me 3
thither with both hands. Now thoroughly disgusted with my host, I ordered him 3
to release me, and told him I would go at once. His clutch relaxed, and as he saw 3
my disgust and offense, his own anger seemed to subside. He tightened his 3
relaxing grip, but this time in a friendly manner, forcing me into a chair; then 3
with an appearance of wistfulness crossing to the littered table, where he wrote 3
many words with a pencil, in the labored French of a foreigner. 3
3
3
3
637 3
3
3
3
The note which he finally handed me was an appeal for tolerance and 3
forgiveness. Zann said that he was old, lonely, and afflicted with strange fears 3
and nervous disorders connected with his music and with other things. He had 3
enjoyed my listening to his music, and wished I would come again and not mind 3
his eccentricities. But he could not play to another his weird harmonies, and 3
could not bear hearing them from another; nor could he bear having anything in 3
his room touched by an-other. He had not known until our hallway conversation 3
that I could overhear his playing in my room, and now asked me if I would 3
arrange with Blandot to take a lower room where I could not hear him in the 3
night. He would, he wrote, defray the difference in rent. 3
3
As I sat deciphering the execrable French, I felt more lenient toward the old man. 3
He was a victim of physical and nervous suffering, as was I; and my 3
metaphysical studies had taught me kindness. In the silence there came a slight 3
sound from the window — the shutter must have rattled in the night wind, and 3
for some reason I started almost as violently as did Erich Zann. So when I had 3
finished reading, I shook my host by the hand, and departed as a friend. 3
3
The next day Blandot gave me a more expensive room on the third floor, 3
between the apartments of an aged money-lender and the room of a respectable 3
upholsterer. There was no one on the fourth floor. 3
3
It was not long before I found that Zann's eagerness for my company was not as 3
great as it had seemed while he was persuading me to move down from the fifth 3
story. He did not ask me to call on him, and when I did call he appeared uneasy 3
and played listlessly. This was always at night— in the day he slept and would 3
admit no one. My liking for him did not grow, though the attic room and the 3
weird music seemed to hold an odd fascination for me. I had a curious desire to 3
look out of that window, over the wall and down the unseen slope at the 3
glittering roofs and spires which must lie outspread there. Once I went up to the 3
garret during theater hours, when Zann was away, but the door was locked. 3
3
What I did succeed in doing was to overhear the nocturnal playing of the dumb 3
old man. At first I would tip-toe up to my old fifth floor, then I grew bold 3
enough to climb the last creaking staircase to the peaked garret. There in the 3
narrow hall, outside the bolted door with the covered keyhole, I often heard 3
sounds which filled me with an indefinable dread — the dread of vague wonder 3
and brooding mystery. It was not that the sounds were hideous, for they were 3
not; but that they held vibrations suggesting nothing on this globe of earth, and 3
that at certain intervals they assumed a symphonic quality which I could hardly 3
conceive as produced by one player. Certainly, Erich Zann was a genius of wild 3
power. As the weeks passed, the playing grew wilder, whilst the old musician 3
acquired an increasing haggardness and furtiveness pitiful to behold. He now 3
3
3
3
638 3
3
3
3
refused to admit me at any time, and shunned me whenever we met on the 3
stairs. 3
3
Then one night as I hstened at the door, I heard the shrieking viol swell into a 3
chaotic babel of sound; a pandemonium which would have led me to doubt my 3
own shaking sanity had there not come from behind that barred portal a piteous 3
proof that the horror was real — the awful, inarticulate cry which only a mute can 3
utter, and which rises only in moments of the most terrible fear or anguish. I 3
knocked repeatedly at the door, but received no response. Afterward I waited in 3
the black hallway, shivering with cold and fear, till I heard the poor musician's 3
feeble effort to rise from the floor by the aid of a chair. Believing him just 3
conscious after a fainting fit, I renewed my rapping, at the same time calling out 3
my name reassuringly. I heard Zann stumble to the window and close both 3
shutter and sash, then stumble to the door, which he falteringly unfastened to 3
admit me. This time his delight at having me present was real; for his distorted 3
face gleamed with relief while he clutched at my coat as a child clutches at its 3
mother's skirts. 3
3
Shaking pathetically, the old man forced me into a chair whilst he sank into 3
another, beside which his viol and bow lay carelessly on the floor. He sat for 3
some time inactive, nodding oddly, but having a paradoxical suggestion of 3
intense and frightened listening. Subsequently he seemed to be satisfied, and 3
crossing to a chair by the table wrote a brief note, handed it to me, and returned 3
to the table, where he began to write rapidly and incessantly. The note implored 3
me in the name of mercy, and for the sake of my own curiosity, to wait where I 3
was while he prepared a full account in German of all the marvels and terrors 3
which beset him. I waited, and the dumb man's pencil flew. 3
3
It was perhaps an hour later, while I still waited and while the old musician's 3
feverishly written sheets still continued to pile up, that I saw Zann start as from 3
the hint of a horrible shock. Unmistakably he was looking at the curtained 3
window and listening shudderingly. Then I half fancied I heard a sound myself; 3
though it was not a horrible sound, but rather an exquisitely low and infinitely 3
distant musical note, suggesting a player in one of the neighboring houses, or in 3
some abode beyond the lofty wall over which I had never been able to look. 3
Upon Zann the effect was terrible, for, dropping his pencil, suddenly he rose, 3
seized his viol, and commenced to rend the night with the wildest playing I had 3
ever heard from his bow save when listening at the barred door. 3
3
It would be useless to describe the playing of Erich Zann on that dreadful night. 3
It was more horrible than anything I had ever overheard, because I could now 3
see the expression of his face, and could realize that this time the motive was 3
stark fear. He was trying to make a noise; to ward something off or drown 3
3
3
3
639 3
3
3
3
something out— what, I could not imagine, awesome though I felt it must be. The 3
playing grew fantastic, dehnous, and hysterical, yet kept to the last the qualities 3
of supreme genius which I knew this strange old man possessed. I recognized 3
the air — it was a wild Hungarian dance popular in the theaters, and I reflected 3
for a moment that this was the first time I had ever heard Zann play the work of 3
another composer. 3
3
Louder and louder, wilder and wilder, mounted the shrieking and whining of 3
that desperate viol. The player was dripping with an uncanny perspiration and 3
twisted like a monkey, always looking frantically at the curtained window. In his 3
frenzied strains I could almost see shadowy satyrs and bacchanals dancing and 3
whirling insanely through seething abysses of clouds and smoke and lightning. 3
And then I thought I heard a shriller, steadier note that was not from the viol; a 3
calm, deliberate, purposeful, mocking note from far away in the West. 3
3
At this juncture the shutter began to rattle in a howling night wind which had 3
sprung up outside as if in answer to the mad playing within. Zann's screaming 3
viol now outdid itself emitting sounds I had never thought a viol could emit. The 3
shutter rattled more loudly, unfastened, and commenced slamming against the 3
window. Then the glass broke shiveringly under the persistent impacts, and the 3
chill wind rushed in, making the candles sputter and rustling the sheets of paper 3
on the table where Zann had begun to write out his horrible secret. I looked at 3
Zann, and saw that he was past conscious observation. His blue eyes were 3
bulging, glassy and sightless, and the frantic playing had become a blind, 3
mechanical, unrecognizable orgy that no pen could even suggest. 3
3
A sudden gust, stronger than the others, caught up the manuscript and bore it 3
toward the window. I followed the flying sheets in desperation, but they were 3
gone before I reached the demolished panes. Then I remembered my old wish to 3
gaze from this window, the only window in the Rue d'Auseil from which one 3
might see the slope beyond the wall, and the city outspread beneath. It was very 3
dark, but the city's lights always burned, and I expected to see them there amidst 3
the rain and wind. Yet when I looked from that highest of all gable windows, 3
looked while the candles sputtered and the insane viol howled with the night- 3
wind, I saw no city spread below, and no friendly lights gleamed from 3
remembered streets, but only the blackness of space illimitable; unimagined 3
space alive with motion and music, and having no semblance of anything on 3
earth. And as I stood there looking in terror, the wind blew out both the candles 3
in that ancient peaked garret, leaving me in savage and impenetrable darkness 3
with chaos and pandemonium before me, and the demon madness of that night- 3
baying viol behind me. 3
3
3
3
640 3
3
3
3
I staggered back in the dark, without the means of striking a hght, crashing 3
against the table, overturning a chair, and finally groping my way to the place 3
where the blackness screamed with shocking music. To save myself and Erich 3
Zann I could at least try, whatever the powers opposed to me. Once I thought 3
some chill thing brushed me, and I screamed, but my scream could not be heard 3
above that hideous viol. Suddenly out of the blackness the madly sawing bow 3
struck me, and I knew I was close to the player. I felt ahead, touched the back of 3
Zann's chair, and then found and shook his shoulder in an effort to bring him to 3
his senses. 3
3
He did not respond, and still the viol shrieked on without slackening. I moved 3
my hand to his head, whose mechanical nodding I was able to stop, and shouted 3
in his ear that we must both flee from the unknown things of the night. But he 3
neither answered me nor abated the frenzy of his unutterable music, while all 3
through the garret strange currents of wind seemed to dance in the darkness and 3
babel. When my hand touched his ear I shuddered, though I knew not why — 3
knew not why till I felt the still face; the ice-cold, stiffened, unbreathing face 3
whose glassy eyes bulged uselessly into the void. And then, by some miracle, 3
finding the door and the large wooden bolt, I plunged wildly away from that 3
glassy-eyed thing in the dark, and from the ghoulish howling of that accursed 3
viol whose fury increased even as I plunged. 3
3
Leaping, floating, flying down those endless stairs through the dark house; 3
racing mindlessly out into the narrow, steep, and ancient street of steps and 3
tottering houses; clattering down steps and over cobbles to the lower streets and 3
the putrid canyon-walled river; panting across the great dark bridge to the 3
broader, healthier streets and boulevards we know; all these are terrible 3
impressions that linger with me. And I recall that there was no wind, and that 3
the moon was out, and that all the lights of the city twinkled. 3
3
Despite my most careful searches and investigations, I have never since been able 3
to find the Rue d'Auseil. But I am not wholly sorry; either for this or for the loss 3
in undreamable abysses of the closely-written sheets which alone could have 3
explained the music of Erich Zann. 3

The Nameless City 3
3
Written in January of 1921 3
3
Published in November of 1921 in The Wolverine 3
3
When I drew nigh the nameless city I knew it was accursed. I was traveling in a 3
parched and terrible valley under the moon, and afar I saw it protruding 3
uncannily above the sands as parts of a corpse may protrude from an ill-made 3
grave. Fear spoke from the age-worn stones of this hoary survivor of the deluge, 3
this great-grandfather of the eldest pyramid; and a viewless aura repelled me 3
and bade me retreat from antique and sinister secrets that no man should see, 3
and no man else had dared to see. 3
3
Remote in the desert of Araby lies the nameless city, crumbling and inarticulate, 3
its low walls nearly hidden by the sands of uncounted ages. It must have been 3
thus before the first stones of Memphis were laid, and while the bricks of 3
Babylon were yet unbaked. There is no legend so old as to give it a name, or to 3
recall that it was ever alive; but it is told of in whispers around campfires and 3
muttered about by grandams in the tents of sheiks so that all the tribes shun it 3
without wholly knowing why. It was of this place that Abdul Alhazred the mad 3
poet dreamed of the night before he sang his unexplained couplet: 3
3
That is not dead which can eternal lie. 3
3
And with strange aeons death may die. 3
3
I should have known that the Arabs had good reason for shunning the nameless 3
city, the city told of in strange tales but seen by no living man, yet I defied them 3
and went into the untrodden waste with my camel. I alone have seen it, and that 3
is why no other face bears such hideous lines of fear as mine; why no other man 3
shivers so horribly when the night wind rattles the windows. When I came upon 3
it in the ghastly stillness of unending sleep it looked at me, chilly from the rays of 3
a cold moon amidst the desert's heat. And as I returned its look I forgot my 3
triumph at finding it, and stopped still with my camel to wait for the dawn. 3
3
For hours I waited, till the east grew grey and the stars faded, and the grey 3
turned to roseate light edged with gold. I heard a moaning and saw a storm of 3
sand stirring among the antique stones though the sky was clear and the vast 3
reaches of desert still. Then suddenly above the desert's far rim came the blazing 3
edge of the sun, seen through the tiny sandstorm which was passing away, and 3
in my fevered state I fancied that from some remote depth there came a crash of 3
musical metal to hail the fiery disc as Memnon hails it from the banks of the Nile. 3
3
3
3
642 3
3
3
3
My ears rang and my imagination seethed as I led my camel slowly across the 3
sand to that unvocal place; that place which I alone of living men had seen. 3
3
In and out amongst the shapeless foundations of houses and places I wandered, 3
finding never a carving or inscription to tell of these men, if men they were, who 3
built this city and dwelt therein so long ago. The antiquity of the spot was 3
unwholesome, and I longed to encounter some sign or device to prove that the 3
city was indeed fashioned by mankind. There were certain proportions and 3
dimensions in the ruins which I did not like. I had with me many tools, and dug 3
much within the walls of the obliterated edifices; but progress was slow, and 3
nothing significant was revealed. When night and the moon returned I felt a chill 3
wind which brought new fear, so that I did not dare to remain in the city. And as 3
I went outside the antique walls to sleep, a small sighing sandstorm gathered 3
behind me, blowing over the grey stones though the moon was bright and most 3
of the desert still. 3
3
I awakened just at dawn from a pageant of horrible dreams, my ears ringing as 3
from some metallic peal. I saw the sun peering redly through the last gusts of a 3
little sandstorm that hovered over the nameless city, and marked the quietness of 3
the rest of the landscape. Once more I ventured within those brooding ruins that 3
swelled beneath the sand like an ogre under a coverlet, and again dug vainly for 3
relics of the forgotten race. At noon I rested, and in the afternoon I spent much 3
time tracing the walls and bygone streets, and the outlines of the nearly vanished 3
buildings. I saw that the city had been mighty indeed, and wondered at the 3
sources of its greatness. To myself I pictured all the spendours of an age so 3
distant that Chaldaea could not recall it, and thought of Sarnath the Doomed, 3
that stood in the land of Mnar when mankind was young, and of lb, that was 3
carven of grey stone before mankind existed. 3
3
All at once I came upon a place where the bedrock rose stark through the sand 3
and formed a low cliff; and here I saw with joy what seemed to promise further 3
traces of the antediluvian people. Hewn rudely on the face of the cliff were the 3
unmistakable facades of several small, squat rock houses or temples; whose 3
interiors might preserve many secrets of ages too remote for calculation, though 3
sandstorms had long effaced any carvings which may have been outside. 3
3
Very low and sand-choked were all the dark apertures near me, but I cleared one 3
with my spade and crawled through it, carrying a torch to reveal whatever 3
mysteries it might hold. When I was inside I saw that the cavern was indeed a 3
temple, and beheld plain signs of the race that had lived and worshipped before 3
the desert was a desert. Primitive altars, pillars, and niches, all curiously low, 3
were not absent; and though I saw no sculptures or frescoes, there were many 3
singular stones clearly shaped into symbols by artificial means. The lowness of 3
3
3
3
643 3
3
3
3
the chiselled chamber was very strange, for I could hardly kneel upright; but the 3
area was so great that my torch showed only part of it at a time. I shuddered 3
oddly in some of the far corners; for certain altars and stones suggested forgotten 3
rites of terrible, revolting and inexplicable nature and made me wonder what 3
manner of men could have made and frequented such a temple. When I had seen 3
all that the place contained, I crawled out again, avid to find what the temples 3
might yield. 3
3
Night had now approached, yet the tangible things I had seen made curiosity 3
stronger than fear, so that I did not flee from the long mooncast shadows that 3
had daunted me when first I saw the nameless city. In the twilight I cleared 3
another aperture and with a new torch crawled into it, finding more vague 3
stones and symbols, though nothing more definite than the other temple had 3
contained. The room was just as low, but much less broad, ending in a very 3
narrow passage crowded with obscure and cryptical shrines. About these shrines 3
I was prying when the noise of a wind and my camel outside broke through the 3
stillness and drew me forth to see what could have frightened the beast. 3
3
The moon was gleaming vividly over the primitive ruins, lighting a dense cloud 3
of sand that seemed blown by a strong but decreasing wind from some point 3
along the cliff ahead of me. I knew it was this chilly, sandy wind which had 3
disturbed the camel and was about to lead him to a place of better shelter when I 3
chanced to glance up and saw that there was no wind atop the cliff. This 3
astonished me and made me fearful again, but I immediately recalled the sudden 3
local winds that I had seen and heard before at sunrise and sunset, and judged it 3
was a normal thing. I decided it came from some rock fissure leading to a cave, 3
and watched the troubled sand to trace it to its source; soon perceiving that it 3
came from the black orifice of a temple a long distance south of me, almost out of 3
sight. Against the choking sand-cloud I plodded toward this temple, which as I 3
neared it loomed larger than the rest, and shewed a doorway far less clogged 3
with caked sand. I would have entered had not the terrific force of the icy wind 3
almost quenched my torch. It poured madly out of the dark door, sighing 3
uncannily as it ruffled the sand and spread among the weird ruins. Soon it grew 3
fainter and the sand grew more and more still, till finally all was at rest again; 3
but a presence seemed stalking among the spectral stones of the city, and when I 3
glanced at the moon it seemed to quiver as though mirrored in unquiet waters. I 3
was more afraid than I could explain, but not enough to dull my thirst for 3
wonder; so as soon as the wind was quite gone I crossed into the dark chamber 3
from which it had come. 3
3
This temple, as I had fancied from the outside, was larger than either of those I 3
had visited before; and was presumably a natural cavern since it bore winds 3
from some region beyond. Here I could stand quite upright, but saw that the 3
3
3
3
644 3
3
3
3
stones and altars were as low as those in the other temples. On the walls and roof 3
I beheld for the first time some traces of the pictorial art of the ancient race, 3
curious curling streaks of paint that had almost faded or crumbled away; and on 3
two of the altars I saw with rising excitement a maze of well-fashioned 3
curvilinear carvings. As I held my torch aloft it seemed to me that the shape of 3
the roof was too regular to be natural, and I wondered what the prehistoric 3
cutters of stone had first worked upon. Their engineering skill must have been 3
vast. 3
3
Then a brighter flare of the fantastic flame showed that form which I had been 3
seeking, the opening to those remoter abysses whence the sudden wind had 3
blown; and I grew faint when I saw that it was a small and plainly artificial door 3
chiselled in the solid rock. I thrust my torch within, beholding a black tunnel 3
with the roof arching low over a rough flight of very small, numerous and 3
steeply descending steps. I shall always see those steps in my dreams, for I came 3
to learn what they meant. At the time I hardly knew whether to call them steps 3
or mere footholds in a precipitous descent. My mind was whirling with mad 3
thoughts, and the words and warning of Arab prophets seemed to float across 3
the desert from the land that men know to the nameless city that men dare not 3
know. Yet I hesitated only for a moment before advancing through the portal 3
and commencing to climb cautiously down the steep passage, feet first, as 3
though on a ladder. 3
3
It is only in the terrible phantasms of drugs or delirium that any other man can 3
have such a descent as mine. The narrow passage led infinitely down like some 3
hideous haunted well, and the torch I held above my head could not light the 3
unknown depths toward which I was crawling. I lost track of the hours and 3
forgot to consult my watch, though I was frightened when I thought of the 3
distance I must be traversing. There were changes of direction and of steepness; 3
and once I came to a long, low, level passage where I had to wriggle my feet first 3
along the rocky floor, holding torch at arm's length beyond my head. The place 3
was not high enough for kneeling. After that were more of the steep steps, and I 3
was still scrambling down interminably when my failing torch died out. I do not 3
think I noticed it at the time, for when I did notice it I was still holding it above 3
me as if it were ablaze. I was quite unbalanced with that instinct for the strange 3
and the unknown which had made me a wanderer upon earth and a haunter of 3
far, ancient, and forbidden places. 3
3
In the darkness there flashed before my mind fragments of my cherished 3
treasury of daemonic lore; sentences from Alhazred the mad Arab, paragraphs 3
from the apocryphal nightmares of Damascius, and infamous lines from the 3
delirious Image du Monde of Gauthier de Metz. I repeated queer extracts, and 3
muttered of Afrasiab and the daemons that floated with him down the Oxus; 3
3
3
3
645 3
3
3
3
later chanting over and over again a phrase from one of Lord Dunsany's tales- 3
"The unreveberate blackness of the abyss." Once when the descent grew 3
amazingly steep I recited something in sing-song from Thomas Moore until I 3
feared to recite more: 3
3
3
3

3
3
3
Time had quite ceased to exist when my feet again felt a level floor, and I found 3
myself in a place slightly higher than the rooms in the two smaller temples now 3
so incalculably far above my head. I could not quite stand, but could kneel 3
upright, and in the dark I shuffled and crept hither and thither at random. I soon 3
knew that I was in a narrow passage whose walls were lined with cases of wood 3
having glass fronts. As in that Palaeozoic and abysmal place I felt of such things 3
as polished wood and glass I shuddered at the possible implications. The cases 3
were apparently ranged along each side of the passage at regular intervals, and 3
were oblong and horizontal, hideously like coffins in shape and size. When I 3
tried to move two or three for further examination, I found that they were firmly 3
fastened. 3
3
I saw that the passage was a long one, so floundered ahead rapidly in a creeping 3
run that would have seemed horrible had any eye watched me in the blackness; 3
crossing from side to side occasionally to feel of my surroundings and be sure 3
the walls and rows of cases still stretched on. Man is so used to thinking visually 3
that I almost forgot the darkness and pictured the endless corridor of wood and 3
glass in its low-studded monotony as though I saw it. And then in a moment of 3
indescribable emotion I did see it. 3
3
Just when my fancy merged into real sight I cannot tell; but there came a gradual 3
glow ahead, and all at once I knew that I saw the dim outlines of a corridor and 3
the cases, revealed by some unknown subterranean phosphorescence. For a little 3
while all was exactly as I had imagined it, since the glow was very faint; but as I 3
mechanically kept stumbling ahead into the stronger light I realised that my 3
fancy had been but feeble. This hall was no relic of crudity like the temples in the 3
city above, but a monument of the most magnificent and exotic art. Rich, vivid. 3

3
and daringly fantastic designs and pictures formed a continuous scheme of 3
mural paintings whose lines and colours were beyond description. The cases 3
were of a strange golden wood, with fronts of exquisite glass, and containing the 3
mummified forms of creatures outreaching in grotesqueness the most chaotic 3
dreams of man. 3
3
To convey any idea of these monstrosities is impossible. They were of the reptile 3
kind, with body lines suggesting sometimes the crocodile, sometimes the seal, 3
but more often nothing of which either the naturalist or the palaeontologist ever 3
heard. In size they approximated a small man, and their fore-legs bore delicate 3
and evident feet curiously like human hands and fingers. But strangest of all 3
were their heads, which presented a contour violating all know biological 3
principles. To nothing can such things be well compared - in one flash I thought 3
of comparisons as varied as the cat, the bullfrog, the mythic Satyr, and the 3
human being. Not Jove himself had had so colossal and protuberant a forehead, 3
yet the horns and the noselessness and the alligator-like jaw placed things 3
outside all established categories. I debated for a time on the reality of the 3
mummies, half suspecting they were artificial idols; but soon decided they were 3
indeed some palaeogean species which had lived when the nameless city was 3
alive. To crown their grotesqueness, most of them were gorgeously enrobed in 3
the costliest of fabrics, and lavishly laden with ornaments of gold, jewels, and 3
unknown shining metals. 3
3
The importance of these crawling creatures must have been vast, for they held 3
first place among the wild designs on the frescoed walls and ceiling. With 3
matchless skill had the artist drawn them in a world of their own, wherein they 3
had cities and gardens fashioned to suit their dimensions; and I could not help 3
but think that their pictured history was allegorical, perhaps shewing the 3
progress of the race that worshipped them. These creatures, I said to myself, 3
were to men of the nameless city what the she-wolf was to Rome, or some totem- 3
beast is to a tribe of Indians. 3
3
Holding this view, I could trace roughly a wonderful epic of the nameless city; 3
the tale of a mighty seacoast metropolis that ruled the world before Africa rose 3
out of the waves, and of its struggles as the sea shrank away, and the desert crept 3
into the fertile valley that held it. I saw its wars and triumphs, its troubles and 3
defeats, and afterwards its terrible fight against the desert when thousands of its 3
people - here represented in allegory by the grotesque reptiles - were driven to 3
chisel their way down though the rocks in some marvellous manner to another 3
world whereof their prophets had told them. It was all vividly weird and 3
realistic, and its connection with the awesome descent I had made was 3
unmistakable. I even recognized the passages. 3
3
3
3
647 3
3
3
3
As I crept along the corridor toward the brighter Hght I saw later stages of the 3
painted epic - the leave-taking of the race that had dwelt in the nameless city and 3
the valley around for ten million years; the race whose souls shrank from 3
quitting scenes their bodies had known so long where they had settled as 3
nomads in the earth's youth, hewing in the virgin rock those primal shrines at 3
which they had never ceased to worship. Now that the light was better I studied 3
the pictures more closely and, remembering that the strange reptiles must 3
represent the unknown men, pondered upon the customs of the nameless city. 3
Many things were peculiar and inexplicable. The civilization, which included a 3
written alphabet, had seemingly risen to a higher order than those immeasurably 3
later civilizations of Egypt and Chaldaea, yet there were curious omissions. I 3
could, for example, find no pictures to represent deaths or funeral customs, save 3
such as were related to wars, violence, and plagues; and I wondered at the 3
reticence shown concerning natural death. It was as though an ideal of 3
immortality had been fostered as a cheering illusion. 3
3
Still nearer the end of the passage was painted scenes of the utmost 3
picturesqueness and extravagance: contrasted views of the nameless city in its 3
desertion and growing ruin, and of the strange new realm of paradise to which 3
the race had hewed its way through the stone. In these views the city and the 3
desert valley were shewn always by moonlight, golden nimbus hovering over 3
the fallen walls, and half-revealing the splendid perfection of former times, 3
shown spectrally and elusively by the artist. The paradisal scenes were almost 3
too extravagant to be believed, portraying a hidden world of eternal day filled 3
with glorious cities and ethereal hills and valleys. At the very last I thought I saw 3
signs of an artistic anticlimax. The paintings were less skillful, and much more 3
bizarre than even the wildest of the earlier scenes. They seemed to record a slow 3
decadence of the ancient stock, coupled with a growing ferocity toward the 3
outside world from which it was driven by the desert. The forms of the people - 3
always represented by the sacred reptiles - appeared to be gradually wasting 3
away, though their spirit as shewn hovering above the ruins by moonlight 3
gained in proportion. Emaciated priests, displayed as reptiles in ornate robes, 3
cursed the upper air and all who breathed it; and one terrible final scene shewed 3
a primitive-looking man, perhaps a pioneer of ancient Irem, the City of Pillars, 3
torn to pieces by members of the elder race. I remembered how the Arabs fear 3
the nameless city, and was glad that beyond this place the grey walls and ceiling 3
were bare. 3
3
As I viewed the pageant of mural history I had approached very closely to the 3
end of the low-ceiled hall, and was aware of a gate through which came all of the 3
illuminating phosphorescence. Creeping up to it, I cried aloud in transcendent 3
amazement at what lay beyond; for instead of other and brighter chambers there 3
was only an illimitable void of uniform radiance, such one might fancy when 3
3
3
3
648 3
3
3
3
gazing down from the peak of Mount Everest upon a sea of sunlit mist. Behind 3
me was a passage so cramped that I could not stand upright in it; before me was 3
an infinity of subterranean effulgence. 3
3
Reaching down from the passage into the abyss was the head of a steep flight of 3
steps - small numerous steps like those of black passages I had traversed - but 3
after a few feet the glowing vapours concealed everything. Swung back open 3
against the left-hand wall of the passage was a massive door of brass, incredibly 3
thick and decorated with fantastic bas-reliefs, which could if closed shut the 3
whole inner world of light away from the vaults and passages of rock. I looked at 3
the steps, and for the nonce dared not try them. I touched the open brass door, 3
and could not move it. Then I sank prone to the stone floor, my mind aflame 3
with prodigious reflections which not even a death-like exhaustion could banish. 3
3
As I lay still with closed eyes, free to ponder, many things I had lightly noted in 3
the frescoes came back to me with new and terrible significance - scenes 3
representing the nameless city in its heyday - the vegetations of the valley 3
around it, and the distant lands with which its merchants traded. The allegory of 3
the crawling creatures puzzled me by its universal prominence, and I wondered 3
that it would be so closely followed in a pictured history of such importance. In 3
the frescoes the nameless city had been shewn in proportions fitted to the 3
reptiles. I wondered what its real proportions and magnificence had been, and 3
reflected a moment on certain oddities I had noticed in the ruins. I thought 3
curiously of the lowness of the primal temples and of the underground corridor, 3
which were doubtless hewn thus out of deference to the reptile deities there 3
honoured; though it perforce reduced the worshippers to crawling. Perhaps the 3
very rites here involved crawling in imitation of the creatures. No religious 3
theory, however, could easily explain why the level passages in that awesome 3
descent should be as low as the temples - or lower, since one could not even 3
kneel in it. As I thought of the crawling creatures, whose hideous mummified 3
forms were so close to me, I felt a new throb of fear. Mental associations are 3
curious, and I shrank from the idea that except for the poor primitive man torn to 3
pieces in the last painting, mine was the only human form amidst the many relics 3
and symbols of the primordial life. 3
3
But as always in my strange and roving existence, wonder soon drove out fear; 3
for the luminous abyss and what it might contain presented a problem worthy of 3
the greatest explorer. That a weird world of mystery lay far down that flight of 3
peculiarly small steps I could not doubt, and I hoped to find there those human 3
memorials which the painted corridor had failed to give. The frescoes had 3
pictured unbelievable cities, and valleys in this lower realm, and my fancy dwelt 3
on the rich and colossal ruins that awaited me. 3
3
3
3
649 3
3
3
3
My fears, indeed, concerned the past rather than the future. Not even the 3
physical horror of my position in that cramped corridor of dead reptiles and 3
antediluvian frescoes, miles below the world I knew and faced by another world 3
of eery light and mist, could match the lethal dread I felt at the abysmal antiquity 3
of the scene and its soul. An ancientness so vast that measurement is feeble 3
seemed to leer down from the primal stones and rock-hewn temples of the 3
nameless city, while the very latest of the astounding maps in the frescoes 3
shewed oceans and continents that man has forgotten, with only here and there 3
some vaguely familiar outlines. Of what could have happened in the geological 3
ages since the paintings ceased and the death-hating race resentfully succumbed 3
to decay, no man might say. Life had once teemed in these caverns and in the 3
luminous realm beyond; now I was alone with vivid relics, and I trembled to 3
think of the countless ages through which these relics had kept a silent deserted 3
vigil. 3
3
Suddenly there came another burst of that acute fear which had intermittently 3
seized me ever since I first saw the terrible valley and the nameless city under a 3
cold moon, and despite my exhaustion I found myself starting frantically to a 3
sitting posture and gazing back along the black corridor toward the tunnels that 3
rose to the outer world. My sensations were like those which had made me shun 3
the nameless city at night, and were as inexplicable as they were poignant. In 3
another moment, however, I received a still greater shock in the form of a 3
definite sound - the first which had broken the utter silence of these tomb-like 3
depths. It was a deep, low moaning, as of a distant throng of condemned spirits, 3
and came from the direction in which I was staring. Its volume rapidly grew, till 3
it soon reverberated frightfully through the low passage, and at the same time I 3
became conscious of an increasing draught of cold air, likewise flowing from the 3
tunnels and the city above. The touch of this air seemed to restore my balance, 3
for I instantly recalled the sudden gusts which had risen around the mouth of the 3
abyss each sunset and sunrise, one of which had indeed revealed the hidden 3
tunnels to me. I looked at my watch and saw that sunrise was near, so braced 3
myself to resist the gale that was sweeping down to its cavern home as it had 3
swept forth at evening. My fear again waned low, since a natural phenomenon 3
tends to dispel broodings over the unknown. 3
3
More and more madly poured the shrieking, moaning night wind into the gulf of 3
the inner earth. I dropped prone again and clutched vainly at the floor for fear of 3
being swept bodily through the open gate into the phosphorescent abyss. Such 3
fury I had not expected, and as I grew aware of an actual slipping of my form 3
toward the abyss I was beset by a thousand new terrors of apprehension and 3
imagination. The malignancy of the blast awakened incredible fancies; once more 3
I compared myself shudderingly to the only human image in that frightful 3
corridor, the man who was torn to pieces by the nameless race, for in the fiendish 3
3
3
3
650 3
3
3
3
clawing of the swirling currents there seemed to abide a vindictive rage all the 3
stronger because it was largely impotent. I think I screamed frantically near the 3
last - I was almost mad - but if I did so my cries were lost in the hell-born babel 3
of the howling wind-wraiths. I tried to crawl against the murderous invisible 3
torrent, but I could not even hold my own as I was pushed slowly and 3
inexorably toward the unknown world. Finally reason must have wholly 3
snapped; for I fell to babbling over and over that unexplainable couplet of the 3
mad Arab Alhazred, who dreamed of the nameless city: 3
3
That is not dead which can eternal lie. 3
3
And with strange aeons even death may die. 3
3
Only the grim brooding desert gods know what really took place-what 3
indescribable struggles and scrambles in the dark I endured or what Abaddon 3
guided me back to life, where I must always remember and shiver in the night 3
wind till oblivion - or worse - claims me. Monstrous, unnatural, colossal, was the 3
thing - too far beyond all the ideas of man to be believed except in the silent 3
damnable small hours of the morning when one cannot sleep. 3
3
I have said that the fury of the rushing blast was infernal - cacodaemoniacal - and 3
that its voices were hideous with the pent-up viciousness of desolate eternities. 3
Presently these voices, while still chaotic before me, seemed to my beating brain 3
to take articulate form behind me; and down there in the grave of unnumbered 3
aeon-dead antiquities, leagues below the dawn-lit world of men, I heard the 3
ghastly cursing and snarling of strange-tongued fiends. Turning, I saw outlined 3
against the luminous aether of the abyss what could not be seen against the dusk 3
of the corridor - a nightmare horde of rushing devils; hate distorted, grotesquely 3
panoplied, half transparent devils of a race no man might mistake - the crawling 3
reptiles of the nameless city. 3
3
And as the wind died away I was plunged into the ghoul-pooled darkness of 3
earth's bowels; for behind the last of the creatures the great brazen door clanged 3
shut with a deafening peal of metallic music whose reverberations swelled out to 3
the distant world to hail the rising sun as Memnon hails it from the banks of the 3
Nile. 3

The Other Gods 3
3
Written on August 14, 1921 3
3
Published in November of 1933 in The Fantasy Fan 3
3
Atop the tallest of earth's peaks dwell the gods of earth, and suffer not man to 3
tell that he hath looked upon them. Lesser peaks they once inhabited; but ever 3
the men from the plains would scale the slopes of rock and snow, driving the 3
gods to higher and higher mountains till now only the last remains. When they 3
left their old peaks they took with them all signs of themselves, save once, it is 3
said, when they left a carven image on the face of the mountain which they called 3
Ngranek. 3
3
But now they have betaken themselves to unknown Kadath in the cold waste 3
where no man treads, and are grown stern, having no higher peak whereto to 3
flee at the coming of men. They are grown stern, and where once they suffered 3
men to displace them, they now forbid men to come; or coming, to depart. It is 3
well for men that they know not of Kadath in the cold waste; else they would 3
seek injudiciously to scale it. 3
3
Sometimes when earth's gods are homesick they visit in the still of the night the 3
peaks where once they dwelt, and weep softly as they try to play in the olden 3
way on remembered slopes. Men have felt the tears of the gods on white-capped 3
Thurai, though they have thought it rain; and have heard the sighs of the gods in 3
the plaintive dawn-winds of Lerion. In cloud-ships the gods are wont to travel, 3
and wise cotters have legends that keep them from certain high peaks at night 3
when it is cloudy, for the gods are not lenient as of old. 3
3
In Ulthar, which lies beyond the river Skai, once dwelt an old man avid to behold 3
the gods of earth; a man deeply learned in the seven cryptical books of earth, and 3
familiar with the Pnakotic Manuscripts of distant and frozen Lomar. His name 3
was Barzai the Wise, and the villagers tell of how he went up a mountain on the 3
night of the strange eclipse. 3
3
Barzai knew so much of the gods that he could tell of their comings and goings, 3
and guessed so many of their secrets that he was deemed half a god himself. It 3
was he who wisely advised the burgesses of Ulthar when they passed their 3
remarkable law against the slaying of cats, and who first told the young priest 3
Atal where it is that black cats go at midnight on St. John's Eve. Barzai was 3
learned in the lore of the earth's gods, and had gained a desire to look upon their 3
faces. He believed that his great secret knowledge of gods could shield him from 3
3
3
3
652 3
3
3
3
their wrath, so resolved to go up to the summit of high and rocky Hatheg-Kla on 3
a night when he knew the gods would be there. 3
3
Hatheg-Kla is far in the stony desert beyond Hatheg, for which it is named, and 3
rises like a rock statue in a silent temple. Around its peak the mists play always 3
mournfully, for mists are the memories of the gods, and the gods loved Hatheg- 3
Kla when they dwelt upon it in the old days. Often the gods of earth visit 3
Hatheg-Kla in their ships of clouds, casting pale vapors over the slopes as they 3
dance reminiscently on the summit under a clear moon. The villagers of Hatheg 3
say it is ill to climb the Hatheg-Kla at any time, and deadly to climb it by night 3
when pale vapors hide the summit and the moon; but Barzai heeded them not 3
when he came from neighboring Ulthar with the young priest Atal, who was his 3
disciple. Atal was only the son of an innkeeper, and was sometimes afraid; but 3
Barzai's father had been a landgrave who dwelt in an ancient castle, so he had no 3
common superstition in his blood, and only laughed at the fearful cotters. 3
3
Banzai and Atal went out of Hatheg into the stony desert despite the prayers of 3
peasants, and talked of earth's gods by their campfires at night. Many days they 3
traveled, and from afar saw lofty Hatheg-Kla with his aureole of mournful mist. 3
On the thirteenth day they reached the mountain's lonely base, and Atal spoke of 3
his fears. But Barzai was old and learned and had no fears, so led the way up the 3
slope that no man had scaled since the time of Sansu, who is written of with 3
fright in the moldy Pnakotic Manuscripts. 3
3
The way was rocky, and made perilous by chasms, cliffs, and falling stones. Later 3
it grew cold and snowy; and Barzai and Atal often slipped and fell as they hewed 3
and plodded upward with staves and axes. Finally the air grew thin, and the sky 3
changed color, and the climbers found it hard to breathe; but still they toiled up 3
and up, marveling at the strangeness of the scene and thrilling at the thought of 3
what would happen on the summit when the moon was out and the pale 3
vapours spread around. For three days they climbed higher and higher toward 3
the roof of the world; then they camped to wait for the clouding of the moon. 3
3
For four nights no clouds came, and the moon shone down cold through the thin 3
mournful mist around the silent pinnacle. Then on the fifth night, which was the 3
night of the full moon, Barzai saw some dense clouds far to the north, and stayed 3
up with Atal to watch them draw near. Thick and majestic they sailed, slowly 3
and deliberately onward; ranging themselves round the peak high above the 3
watchers, and hiding the moon and the summit from view. For a long hour the 3
watchers gazed, whilst the vapours swirled and the screen of clouds grew thicker 3
and more restless. Barzai was wise in the lore of earth's gods, and listened hard 3
for certain sounds, but Atal felt the chill of the vapours and the awe of the night. 3
3
3
3
653 3
3
3
3
and feared much. And when Barzai began to cHmb higher and beckon eagerly, it 3
was long before Atal would follow. 3
3
So thick were the vapours that the way was hard, and though Atal followed at 3
last, he could scarce see the gray shape of Barzai on the dim slope above in the 3
clouded moonlight. Barzai forged very far ahead, and seemed despite his age to 3
climb more easily than Atal; fearing not the steepness that began to grow too 3
great for any save a strong and dauntless man, nor pausing at wide black chasms 3
that Atal could scarce leap. And so they went up wildly over rocks and gulfs, 3
slipping and stumbling, and sometimes awed at the vastness and horrible silence 3
of bleak ice pinnacles and mute granite steeps. 3
3
Very suddenly Barzai went out of Atal's sight, scaling a hideous cliff that seemed 3
to bulge outward and block the path for any climber not inspired of earth's gods. 3
Atal was far below, and planning what he should do when he reached the place, 3
when curiously he noticed that the light had grown strong, as if the cloudless 3
peak and moonlit meetingplace of the gods were very near. And as he scrambled 3
on toward the bulging cliff and litten sky he felt fears more shocking than any he 3
had known before. Then through the high mists he heard the voice of Barzai 3
shouting wildly in delight: 3
3
"I have heard the gods. I have heard earth's gods singing in revelry on Hatheg- 3
Kla! The voices of earth's gods are known to Barzai the Prophet! The mists are 3
thin and the moon is bright, and I shall see the gods dancing wildly on Hatheg- 3
Kla that they loved in youth. The wisdom of Barzai hath made him greater than 3
earth's gods, and against his will their spells and barriers are as naught; Barzai 3
will behold the gods, the proud gods, the secret gods, the gods of earth who 3
spurn the sight of man!" 3
3
Atal could not hear the voices Barzai heard, but he was now close to the bulging 3
cliff and scanning it for footholds. Then he heard Barzai's voice grow shriller and 3
louder: 3
3
"The mist is very thin, and the moon casts shadows on the slope; the voices of 3
earth's gods are high and wild, and they fear the coming of Barzai the Wise, who 3
is greater than they... The moon's light flickers, as earth's gods dance against it; I 3
shall see the dancing forms of the gods that leap and howl in the moonlight. . . 3
The light is dimmer and the gods are afraid. . ." 3
3
Whilst Barzai was shouting these things Atal felt a spectral change in all the air, 3
as if the laws of earth were bowing to greater laws; for though the way was 3
steeper than ever, the upward path was now grown fearsomely easy, and the 3
bulging cliff proved scarce an obstacle when he reached it and slid perilously up 3
3
3
3
654 3
3
3
3
its convex face. The light of the moon had strangely failed, and as Atal plunged 3
upward through the mists he heard Barzai the Wise shrieking in the shadows: 3
3
"The moon is dark, and the gods dance in the night; there is terror in the sky, for 3
upon the moon hath sunk an eclipse foretold in no books of men or of earth's 3
gods. . . There is unknown magic on Hatheg-Kla, for the screams of the frightened 3
gods have turned to laughter, and the slopes of ice shoot up endlessly into the 3
black heavens whither I am plunging... Hei! Hei! At last! In the dim light I 3
behold the gods of earth!" 3
3
And now Atal, slipping dizzily up over inconceivable steeps, heard in the dark a 3
loathsome laughing, mixed with such a cry as no man else ever heard save in the 3
Phlegethon of unrelatable nightmares; a cry wherein reverberated the horror and 3
anguish of a haunted lifetime packed into one atrocious moment: 3
3
"The other gods! The other gods! The gods of the outer hells that guard the feeble 3
gods of earth!... Look away... Go back... Do not see! Do not see! The vengeance 3
of the infinite abysses... That cursed, that damnable pit... Merciful gods of earth, 3
I am falling into the sky!" 3
3
And as Atal shut his eyes and stopped his ears and tried to hump downward 3
against the frightful pull from unknown heights, there resounded on Hatheg-Kla 3
that terrible peal of thunder which awaked the good cotters of the plains and the 3
honest burgesses of Hatheg, Nir and Ulthar, and caused them to behold through 3
the clouds that strange eclipse of the moon that no book ever predicted. And 3
when the moon came out at last Atal was safe on the lower snows of the 3
mountain without sight of earth's gods, or of the other gods. 3
3
Now it is told in the moldy Pnakotic Manuscripts that Sansu found naught but 3
wordless ice and rock when he did climb Hatheg-Kla in the youth of the world. 3
Yet when the men of Ulthar and Nir and Hatheg crushed their fears and scaled 3
that haunted steep by day in search of Barzai the Wise, they found graven in the 3
naked stone of the summit a curious and cyclopean symbol fifty cubits wide, as if 3
the rock had been riven by some titanic chisel. And the symbol was like to one 3
that learned men have discerned in those frightful parts of the Pnakotic 3
Manuscripts which were too ancient to be read. This they found. 3
3
Barzai the Wise they never found, nor could the holy priest Atal ever be 3
persuaded to pray for his soul's repose. Moreover, to this day the people of 3
Ulthar and Nir and Hatheg fear eclipses, and pray by night when pale vapors 3
hide the mountain-top and the moon. And above the mists on Hatheg-Kla, 3
earth's gods sometimes dance reminiscently; for they know they are safe, and 3
love to come from unknown Kadath in ships of clouds and play in the olden 3
3

way, as they did when earth was new and men not given to the chmbing of 3
inaccessible places. 3

Written in 1921 3

Published in April of 1926 in Weird Tales 3
3
Unhappy is he to whom the memories of childhood bring only fear and sadness. 3
Wretched is he who looks back upon lone hours in vast and dismal chambers 3
with brown hangings and maddening rows of antique books, or upon awed 3
watches in twilight groves of grotesque, gigantic, and vine-encumbered trees 3
that silently wave twisted branches far aloft. Such a lot the gods gave to me - to 3
me, the dazed, the disappointed; the barren, the broken. And yet I am strangely 3
content and cling desperately to those sere memories, when my mind 3
momentarily threatens to reach beyond to the other. 3
3
I know not where I was born, save that the castle was infinitely old and infinitely 3
horrible, full of dark passages and having high ceilings where the eye could find 3
only cobwebs and shadows. The stones in the crumbling corridors seemed 3
always hideously damp, and there was an accursed smell everywhere, as of the 3
piled-up corpses of dead generations. It was never light, so that I used sometimes 3
to light candles and gaze steadily at them for relief, nor was there any sun 3
outdoors, since the terrible trees grew high above the topmost accessible tower. 3
There was one black tower which reached above the trees into the unknown 3
outer sky, but that was partly ruined and could not be ascended save by a well- 3
nigh impossible climb up the sheer wall, stone by stone. 3
3
I must have lived years in this place, but I cannot measure the time. Beings must 3
have cared for my needs, yet I cannot recall any person except myself, or 3
anything alive but the noiseless rats and bats and spiders. I think that whoever 3
nursed me must have been shockingly aged, since my first conception of a living 3
person was that of somebody mockingly like myself, yet distorted, shrivelled, 3
and decaying like the castle. To me there was nothing grotesque in the bones and 3
skeletons that strewed some of the stone crypts deep down among the 3
foundations. I fantastically associated these things with everyday events, and 3
thought them more natural than the coloured pictures of living beings which I 3
found in many of the mouldy books. From such books I learned all that I know. 3
No teacher urged or guided me, and I do not recall hearing any human voice in 3
all those years - not even my own; for although I had read of speech, I had never 3
thought to try to speak aloud. My aspect was a matter equally unthought of, for 3
there were no mirrors in the castle, and I merely regarded myself by instinct as 3
akin to the youthful figures I saw drawn and painted in the books. I felt 3
conscious of youth because I remembered so little. 3

Outside, across the putrid moat and under the dark mute trees, I would often he 3
and dream for hours about what I read in the books; and would longingly 3
picture myself amidst gay crowds in the sunny world beyond the endless forests. 3
Once I tried to escape from the forest, but as I went farther from the castle the 3
shade grew denser and the air more filled with brooding fear; so that I ran 3
frantically back lest I lose my way in a labyrinth of nighted silence. 3
3
So through endless twilights I dreamed and waited, though I knew not what I 3
waited for. Then in the shadowy solitude my longing for light grew so frantic 3
that I could rest no more, and I lifted entreating hands to the single black ruined 3
tower that reached above the forest into the unknown outer sky. And at last I 3
resolved to scale that tower, fall though I might; since it were better to glimpse 3
the sky and perish, than to live without ever beholding day. 3
3
In the dank twilight I climbed the worn and aged stone stairs till I reached the 3
level where they ceased, and thereafter clung perilously to small footholds 3
leading upward. Ghastly and terrible was that dead, stairless cylinder of rock; 3
black, ruined, and deserted, and sinister with startled bats whose wings made no 3
noise. But more ghastly and terrible still was the slowness of my progress; for 3
climb as I might, the darkness overhead grew no thinner, and a new chill as of 3
haunted and venerable mould assailed me. I shivered as I wondered why I did 3
not reach the light, and would have looked down had I dared. I fancied that 3
night had come suddenly upon me, and vainly groped with one free hand for a 3
window embrasure, that I might peer out and above, and try to judge the height I 3
had once attained. 3
3
All at once, after an infinity of awesome, sightless, crawling up that concave and 3
desperate precipice, I felt my head touch a solid thing, and I knew I must have 3
gained the roof, or at least some kind of floor. In the darkness I raised my free 3
hand and tested the barrier, finding it stone and immovable. Then came a deadly 3
circuit of the tower, clinging to whatever holds the slimy wall could give; till 3
finally my testing hand found the barrier yielding, and I turned upward again, 3
pushing the slab or door with my head as I used both hands in my fearful ascent. 3
There was no light revealed above, and as my hands went higher I knew that my 3
climb was for the nonce ended; since the slab was the trapdoor of an aperture 3
leading to a level stone surface of greater circumference than the lower tower, no 3
doubt the floor of some lofty and capacious observation chamber. I crawled 3
through carefully, and tried to prevent the heavy slab from falling back into 3
place, but failed in the latter attempt. As I lay exhausted on the stone floor I 3
heard the eerie echoes of its fall, hoped when necessary to pry it up again. 3
3
Believing I was now at prodigious height, far above the accursed branches of the 3
wood, I dragged myself up from the floor and fumbled about for windows, that I 3
3
3
3
658 3
3
3
3
might look for the first time upon the sky, and the moon and stars of which I had 3
read. But on every hand I was disappointed; since all that I found were vast 3
shelves of marble, bearing odious oblong boxes of disturbing size. More and 3
more I reflected, and wondered what hoary secrets might abide in this high 3
apartment so many aeons cut off from the castle below. Then unexpectedly my 3
hands came upon a doorway, where hung a portal of stone, rough with strange 3
chiselling. Trying it, I found it locked; but with a supreme burst of strength I 3
overcame all obstacles and dragged it open inward. As I did so there came to me 3
the purest ecstasy I have ever known; for shining tranquilly through an ornate 3
grating of iron, and down a short stone passageway of steps that ascended from 3
the newly found doorway, was the radiant full moon, which I had never before 3
seen save in dreams and in vague visions I dared not call memories. 3
3
Fancying now that I had attained the very pinnacle of the castle, I commenced to 3
rush up the few steps beyond the door; but the sudden veiling of the moon by a 3
cloud caused me to stumble, and I felt my way more slowly in the dark. It was 3
still very dark when I reached the grating - which I tried carefully and found 3
unlocked, but which I did not open for fear of falling from the amazing height to 3
which I had climbed. Then the moon came out. 3
3
Most demoniacal of all shocks is that of the abysmally unexpected and 3
grotesquely unbelievable. Nothing I had before undergone could compare in 3
terror with what I now saw; with the bizarre marvels that sight implied. The 3
sight itself was as simple as it was stupefying, for it was merely this: instead of a 3
dizzying prospect of treetops seen from a lofty eminence, there stretched around 3
me on the level through the grating nothing less than the solid ground, decked 3
and diversified by marble slabs and columns, and overshadowed by an ancient 3
stone church, whose ruined spire gleamed spectrally in the moonlight. 3
3
Half unconscious, I opened the grating and staggered out upon the white gravel 3
path that stretched away in two directions. My mind, stunned and chaotic as it 3
was, still held the frantic craving for light; and not even the fantastic wonder 3
which had happened could stay my course. I neither knew nor cared whether my 3
experience was insanity, dreaming, or magic; but was determined to gaze on 3
brilliance and gaiety at any cost. I knew not who I was or what I was, or what my 3
surroundings might be; though as I continued to stumble along I became 3
conscious of a kind of fearsome latent memory that made my progress not 3
wholly fortuitous. I passed under an arch out of that region of slabs and 3
columns, and wandered through the open country; sometimes following the 3
visible road, but sometimes leaving it curiously to tread across meadows where 3
only occasional ruins bespoke the ancient presence of a forgotten road. Once I 3
swam across a swift river where crumbling, mossy masonry told of a bridge long 3
vanished. 3

3
Over two hours must have passed before I reached what seemed to be my goal, a 3
venerable ivied castle in a thickly wooded park, maddeningly familiar, yet full of 3
perplexing strangeness to me. I saw that the moat was filled in, and that some of 3
the well-known towers were demolished, whilst new wings existed to confuse 3
the beholder. But what I observed with chief interest and delight were the open 3
windows - gorgeously ablaze with light and sending forth sound of the gayest 3
revelry. Advancing to one of these I looked in and saw an oddly dressed 3
company indeed; making merry, and speaking brightly to one another. I had 3
never, seemingly, heard human speech before and could guess only vaguely 3
what was said. Some of the faces seemed to hold expressions that brought up 3
incredibly remote recollections, others were utterly alien. 3
3
I now stepped through the low window into the brilliantly lighted room, 3
stepping as I did so from my single bright moment of hope to my blackest 3
convulsion of despair and realization. The nightmare was quick to come, for as I 3
entered, there occurred immediately one of the most terrifying demonstrations I 3
had ever conceived. Scarcely had I crossed the sill when there descended upon 3
the whole company a sudden and unheralded fear of hideous intensity, 3
distorting every face and evoking the most horrible screams from nearly every 3
throat. Flight was universal, and in the clamour and panic several fell in a swoon 3
and were dragged away by their madly fleeing companions. Many covered their 3
eyes with their hands, and plunged blindly and awkwardly in their race to 3
escape, overturning furniture and stumbling against the walls before they 3
managed to reach one of the many doors. 3
3
The cries were shocking; and as I stood in the brilliant apartment alone and 3
dazed, listening to their vanishing echoes, I trembled at the thought of what 3
might be lurking near me unseen. At a casual inspection the room seemed 3
deserted, but when I moved towards one of the alcoves I thought I detected a 3
presence there - a hint of motion beyond the golden-arched doorway leading to 3
another and somewhat similar room. As I approached the arch I began to 3
perceive the presence more clearly; and then, with the first and last sound I ever 3
uttered - a ghastly ululation that revolted me almost as poignantly as its noxious 3
cause - I beheld in full, frightful vividness the inconceivable, indescribable, and 3
unmentionable monstrosity which had by its simple appearance changed a 3
merry company to a herd of delirious fugitives. 3
3
I cannot even hint what it was like, for it was a compound of all that is unclean, 3
uncanny, unwelcome, abnormal, and detestable. It was the ghoulish shade of 3
decay, antiquity, and dissolution; the putrid, dripping eidolon of unwholesome 3
revelation, the awful baring of that which the merciful earth should always hide. 3
God knows it was not of this world - or no longer of this world - yet to my horror 3
I saw in its eaten-away and bone-revealing outlines a leering, abhorrent travesty 3
3
3
3
660 3
3
3
3
on the human shape; and in its mouldy, disintegrating apparel an unspeakable 3
quality that chilled me even more. 3
3
I was almost paralysed, but not too much so to make a feeble effort towards 3
flight; a backward stumble which failed to break the spell in which the nameless, 3
voiceless monster held me. My eyes bewitched by the glassy orbs which stared 3
loathsomely into them, refused to close; though they were mercifully blurred, 3
and showed the terrible object but indistinctly after the first shock. I tried to raise 3
my hand to shut out the sight, yet so stunned were my nerves that my arm could 3
not fully obey my will. The attempt, however, was enough to disturb my 3
balance; so that I had to stagger forward several steps to avoid falling. As I did so 3
I became suddenly and agonizingly aware of the nearness of the carrion thing, 3
whose hideous hollow breathing I half fancied I could hear. Nearly mad, I found 3
myself yet able to throw out a hand to ward off the foetid apparition which 3
pressed so close; when in one cataclysmic second of cosmic nightmarishness and 3
hellish accident my fingers touched the rotting outstretched paw of the monster 3
beneath the golden arch. 3
3
I did not shriek, but all the fiendish ghouls that ride the nightwind shrieked for 3
me as in that same second there crashed down upon my mind a single fleeting 3
avalanche of soul-annihilating memory. I knew in that second all that had been; I 3
remembered beyond the frightful castle and the trees, and recognized the altered 3
edifice in which I now stood; I recognized, most terrible of all, the unholy 3
abomination that stood leering before me as I withdrew my sullied fingers from 3
its own. 3
3
But in the cosmos there is balm as well as bitterness, and that balm is nepenthe. 3
In the supreme horror of that second I forgot what had horrified me, and the 3
burst of black memory vanished in a chaos of echoing images. In a dream I fled 3
from that haunted and accursed pile, and ran swiftly and silently in the 3
moonlight. When I returned to the churchyard place of marble and went down 3
the steps I found the stone trap-door immovable; but I was not sorry, for I had 3
hated the antique castle and the trees. Now I ride with the mocking and friendly 3
ghouls on the night-wind, and play by day amongst the catacombs of Nephren- 3
Ka in the sealed and unknown valley of Hadoth by the Nile. I know that light is 3
not for me, save that of the moon over the rock tombs of Neb, nor any gaiety save 3
the unnamed feasts of Nitokris beneath the Great Pyramid; yet in my new 3
wildness and freedom I almost welcome the bitterness of alienage. 3
3
For although nepenthe has calmed me, I know always that I am an outsider; a 3
stranger in this century and among those who are still men. This I have known 3
ever since I stretched out my fingers to the abomination within that great gilded 3
3
3
3

frame; stretched out my fingers and touched a cold and unyielding surface of 3
polished glass. 3

Searchers after horror haunt strange, far places. For them are the catacombs of 3
Ptolemais, and the carven mausolea of the nightmare countries. They climb to 3
the moonlit towers of ruined Rhine castles, and falter down black cobwebbed 3
steps beneath the scattered stones of forgotten cities in Asia. The haunted wood 3
and the desolate mountain are their shrines, and they linger around the sinister 3
monoliths on uninhabited islands. But the true epicure in the terrible, to whom a 3
new thrill of unutterable ghastliness is the chief end and justification of existence, 3
esteems most of all the ancient, lonely farmhouses of backwoods New England; 3
for there the dark elements of strength, solitude, grotesqueness and ignorance 3
combine to form the perfection of the hideous. 3
3
Most horrible of all sights are the little unpainted wooden houses remote from 3
travelled ways, usually squatted upon some damp grassy slope or leaning 3
against some gigantic outcropping of rock. Two hundred years and more they 3
have leaned or squatted there, while the vines have crawled and the trees have 3
swelled and spread. They are almost hidden now in lawless luxuriances of green 3
and guardian shrouds of shadow; but the small-paned windows still stare 3
shockingly, as if blinking through a lethal stupor which wards off madness by 3
dulling the memory of unutterable things. 3
3
In such houses have dwelt generations of strange people, whose like the world 3
has never seen. Seized with a gloomy and fanatical belief which exiled them from 3
their kind, their ancestors sought the wilderness for freedom. There the scions of 3
a conquering race indeed flourished free from the restrictions of their fellows, but 3
cowered in an appalling slavery to the dismal phantasms of their own minds. 3
Divorced from the enlightenment of civilization, the strength of these Puritans 3
turned into singular channels; and in their isolation, morbid self-repression, and 3
struggle for life with relentless Nature, there came to them dark furtive traits 3
from the prehistoric depths of their cold Northern heritage. By necessity practical 3
and by philosophy stern, these folks were not beautiful in their sins. Erring as all 3
mortals must, they were forced by their rigid code to seek concealment above all 3
else; so that they came to use less and less taste in what they concealed. Only the 3
silent, sleepy, staring houses in the backwoods can tell all that has lain hidden 3
since the early days, and they are not communicative, being loath to shake off the 3
drowsiness which helps them forget. Sometimes one feels that it would be 3
merciful to tear down these houses, for they must often dream. 3

It was to a time-battered edifice of this description that I was driven one 3
afternoon in November, 1896, by a rain of such chilHng copiousness that any 3
shelter was preferable to exposure. I had been travelling for some time amongst 3
the people of the Miskatonic Valley in quest of certain genealogical data; and 3
from the remote, devious, and problematical nature of my course, had deemed it 3
convenient to employ a bicycle despite the lateness of the season. Now I found 3
myself upon an apparently abandoned road which I had chosen as the shortest 3
cut to Arkham, overtaken by the storm at a point far from any town, and 3
confronted with no refuge save the antique and repellent wooden building 3
which blinked with bleared windows from between two huge leafless elms near 3
the foot of a rocky hill. Distant though it is from the remnant of a road, this house 3
none the less impressed me unfavorably the very moment I espied it. Honest, 3
wholesome structures do not stare at travellers so slyly and hauntingly, and in 3
my genealogical researches I had encountered legends of a century before which 3
biased me against places of this kind. Yet the force of the elements was such as to 3
overcome my scruples, and I did not hesitate to wheel my machine up the weedy 3
rise to the closed door which seemed at once so suggestive and secretive. 3
3
I had somehow taken it for granted that the house was abandoned, yet as I 3
approached it I was not so sure, for though the walks were indeed overgrown 3
with weeds, they seemed to retain their nature a little too well to argue complete 3
desertion. Therefore instead of trying the door I knocked, feeling as I did so a 3
trepidation I could scarcely explain. As I waited on the rough, mossy rock which 3
served as a door-step, I glanced at the neighboring windows and the panes of the 3
transom above me, and noticed that although old, rattling, and almost opaque 3
with dirt, they were not broken. The building, then, must still be inhabited, 3
despite its isolation and general neglect. However, my rapping evoked no 3
response, so after repeating the summons I tried the rusty latch and found the 3
door unfastened. Inside was a little vestibule with walls from which the plaster 3
was falling, and through the doorway came a faint but peculiarly hateful odor. I 3
entered, carrying my bicycle, and closed the door behind me. Ahead rose a 3
narrow staircase, flanked by a small door probably leading to the cellar, while to 3
the left and right were closed doors leading to rooms on the ground floor. 3
3
Leaning my cycle against the wall I opened the door at the left, and crossed into 3
a small low-ceiled chamber but dimly lighted by its two dusty windows and 3
furnished in the barest and most primitive possible way. It appeared to be a kind 3
of sitting-room, for it had a table and several chairs, and an immense fireplace 3
above which ticked an antique clock on a mantel. Books and papers were very 3
few, and in the prevailing gloom I could not readily discern the titles. What 3
interested me was the uniform air of archaism as displayed in every visible 3
detail. Most of the houses in this region I had found rich in relics of the past, but 3
here the antiquity was curiously complete; for in all the room I could not 3
3
3
3
664 3
3
3
3
discover a single article of definitely post-revolutionary date. Had the 3
furnishings been less humble, the place would have been a collector's paradise. 3
3
As I surveyed this quaint apartment, I felt an increase in that aversion first 3
excited by the bleak exterior of the house. Just what it was that I feared or 3
loathed, I could by no means define; but something in the whole atmosphere 3
seemed redolent of unhallowed age, of unpleasant crudeness, and of secrets 3
which should be forgotten. I felt disinclined to sit down, and wandered about 3
examining the various articles which I had noticed. The first object of my 3
curiosity was a book of medium size lying upon the table and presenting such an 3
antediluvian aspect that I marvelled at beholding it outside a museum or library. 3
It was bound in leather with metal fittings, and was in an excellent state of 3
preservation; being altogether an unusual sort of volume to encounter in an 3
abode so lowly. When I opened it to the title page my wonder grew even greater, 3
for it proved to be nothing less rare than Pigafetta's account of the Congo region, 3
written in Latin from the notes of the sailor Lopex and printed at Frankfurt in 3
1598. I had often heard of this work, with its curious illustrations by the brothers 3
De Bry, hence for a moment forgot my uneasiness in my desire to turn the pages 3
before me. The engravings were indeed interesting, drawn wholly from 3
imagination and careless descriptions, and represented negroes with white skins 3
and Caucasian features; nor would I soon have closed the book had not an 3
exceedingly trivial circumstance upset my tired nerves and revived my sensation 3
of disquiet. What annoyed me was merely the persistent way in which the 3
volume tended to fall open of itself at Plate XII, which represented in gruesome 3
detail a butcher's shop of the cannibal Anziques. I experienced some shame at 3
my susceptibility to so slight a thing, but the drawing nevertheless disturbed me, 3
especially in connection with some adjacent passages descriptive of Anzique 3
gastronomy. 3
3
I had turned to a neighboring shelf and was examining its meagre literary 3
contents - an eighteenth century Bible, a "Pilgrim's Progress" of like period, 3
illustrated with grotesque woodcuts and printed by the almanack-maker Isaiah 3
Thomas, the rotting bulk of Cotton Mather's "Magnalia Christi Americana," and 3
a few other books of evidently equal age - when my attention was aroused by the 3
unmistakable sound of walking in the room overhead. At first astonished and 3
startled, considering the lack of response to my recent knocking at the door, I 3
immediately afterward concluded that the walker had just awakened from a 3
sound sleep, and listened with less surprise as the footsteps sounded on the 3
creaking stairs. The tread was heavy, yet seemed to contain a curious quality of 3
cautiousness; a quality which I disliked the more because the tread was heavy. 3
When I had entered the room I had shut the door behind me. Now, after a 3
moment of silence during which the walker may have been inspecting my 3
3
3
3
665 3
3
3
3
bicycle in the hall, I heard a fumbling at the latch and saw the paneled portal 3
swing open again. 3
3
In the doorway stood a person of such singular appearance that I should have 3
exclaimed aloud but for the restraints of good breeding. Old, white-bearded, and 3
ragged, my host possessed a countenance and physique which inspired equal 3
wonder and respect. His height could not have been less than six feet, and 3
despite a general air of age and poverty he was stout and powerful in 3
proportion. His face, almost hidden by a long beard which grew high on the 3
cheeks, seemed abnormally ruddy and less wrinkled than one might expect; 3
while over a high forehead fell a shock of white hair little thinned by the years. 3
His blue eyes, though a trifle bloodshot, seemed inexplicably keen and burning. 3
But for his horrible unkemptness the man would have been as distinguished- 3
looking as he was impressive. This unkemptness, however, made him offensive 3
despite his face and figure. Of what his clothing consisted I could hardly tell, for 3
it seemed to me no more than a mass of tatters surmounting a pair of high, heavy 3
boots; and his lack of cleanliness surpassed description. 3
3
The appearance of this man, and the instinctive fear he inspired, prepared me for 3
something like enmity; so that I almost shuddered through surprise and a sense 3
of uncanny incongruity when he motioned me to a chair and addressed me in a 3
thin, weak voice full of fawning respect and ingratiating hospitality. His speech 3
was very curious, an extreme form of Yankee dialect I had thought long extinct; 3
and I studied it closely as he sat down opposite me for conversation. 3
3
"Ketched in the rain, be ye?" he greeted. "Glad ye was nigh the haouse en' hed 3
the sense ta come right in. I calc'late I was alseep, else I'd a heerd ye-I ain't as 3
young as I uster be, an' I need a paowerful sight o' naps naowadays. Trav'lin fur? 3
I hain't seed many folks 'long this rud sence they tuk off the Arkham stage." 3
3
I replied that I was going to Arkham, and apologized for my rude entry into his 3
domicile, whereupon he continued. 3
3
"Glad ta see ye, young Sir - new faces is scurce arount here, an' I hain't got much 3
ta cheer me up these days. Guess yew hail from Bosting, don't ye? I never ben 3
thar, but I kin tell a taown man when I see 'im - we hed one fer deestrick 3
schoolmaster in 'eighty-four, but he quit suddent an' no one never heerd on 'im 3
sence - " here the old man lapsed into a kind of chuckle, and made no 3
explanation when I questioned him. He seemed to be in an aboundingly good 3
humor, yet to possess those eccentricities which one might guess from his 3
grooming. For some time he rambled on with an almost feverish geniality, when 3
it struck me to ask him how he came by so rare a book as Pigafetta's "Regnum 3
Congo." The effect of this volume had not left me, and I felt a certain hesitancy in 3
3
3
3
666 3
3
3
3
speaking of it, but curiosity overmastered all the vague fears which had steadily 3
accumulated since my first glimpse of the house. To my relief, the question did 3
not seem an awkward one, for the old man answered freely and volubly. 3
3
"Oh, that Afriky book? Cap'n Ebenezer Holt traded me thet in 'sixty-eight - him 3
as was kilt in the war." Something about the name of Ebenezer Holt caused me 3
to look up sharply. I had encountered it in my genealogical work, but not in any 3
record since the Revolution. I wondered if my host could help me in the task at 3
which I was laboring, and resolved to ask him about it later on. He continued. 3
3
"Ebenezer was on a Salem merchantman for years, an' picked up a sight o' queer 3
stuff in every port. He got this in London, I guess - he uster like ter buy things at 3
the shops. I was up ta his haouse onct, on the hill, tradin' bosses, when I see this 3
book. I relished the picters, so he give it in on a swap. 'Tis a queer book - here, 3
leave me git on my spectacles-" The old man fumbled among his rags, producing 3
a pair of dirty and amazingly antique glasses with small octagonal lenses and 3
steel bows. Donning these, he reached for the volume on the table and turned the 3
pages lovingly. 3
3
"Ebenezer cud read a leetle o' this-'tis Latin - but I can't. I had two er three 3
schoolmasters read me a bit, and Passon Clark, him they say got draownded in 3
the pond - kin yew make anything outen it?" I told him that I could, and 3
translated for his benefit a paragraph near the beginning. If I erred, he was not 3
scholar enough to correct me; for he seemed childishly pleased at my English 3
version. His proximity was becoming rather obnoxious, yet I saw no way to 3
escape without offending him. I was amused at the childish fondness of this 3
ignorant old man for the pictures in a book he could not read, and wondered 3
how much better he could read the few books in English which adorned the 3
room. This revelation of simplicity removed much of the ill-defined 3
apprehension I had felt, and I smiled as my host rambled on: 3
3
"Queer haow picters kin set a body thinkin'. Take this un here near the front. 3
Hey yew ever seed trees like thet, with big leaves a floppin' over an' daown? 3
And them men - them can't be niggers - they dew beat all. Kinder like Injuns, I 3
guess, even ef they be in Afriky. Some o' these here critters looks like monkeys, 3
or half monkeys an' half men, but I never heerd o' nothin' like this un." Here he 3
pointed to a fabulous creature of the artist, which one might describe as a sort of 3
dragon with the head of an alligator. 3
3
"But naow I'll show ye the best un - over here nigh the middle - "The old man's 3
speech grew a trifle thicker and his eyes assumed a brighter glow; but his 3
fumbling hands, though seemingly clumsier than before, were entirely adequate 3
to their mission. The book fell open, almost of its own accord and as if from 3
3
3
3
667 3
3
3
3
frequent consultation at this place, to the repellent twelfth plate showing a 3
butcher's shop amongst the Anzique cannibals. My sense of restlessness 3
returned, though I did not exhibit it. The especially bizarre thing was that the 3
artist had made his Africans look like white men - the limbs and quarters 3
hanging about the walls of the shop were ghastly, while the butcher with his axe 3
was hideously incongruous. But my host seemed to relish the view as much as I 3
disliked it. 3
3
"What d'ye think o' this - ain't never see the like hereabouts, eh? When I see this 3
I felled Eb Holt, 'That's suthin' ta stir ye up an' make yer blood tickle.' When I 3
read in Scripter about slayin' - like them Midianites was slew - I kinder think 3
things, but I ain't got no picter of it. Here a body kin see all they is to it - I s'pose 3
'tis sinful, but ain't we all born an' livin' in sin? - Thet feller bein' chopped up 3
gives me a tickle every time I look at 'im - I hey ta keep lookin' at 'im - see whar 3
the butcher cut off his feet? Thar's his head on thet bench, with one arm side of it, 3
an' t'other arm's on the other side o' the meat block." 3
3
As the man mumbled on in his shocking ecstasy the expression on his hairy, 3
spectacled face became indescribable, but his voice sank rather than mounted. 3
My own sensations can scarcely be recorded. All the terror I had dimly felt 3
before rushed upon me actively and vividly, and I knew that I loathed the 3
ancient and abhorrent creature so near me with an infinite intensity. His 3
madness, or at least his partial perversion, seemed beyond dispute. He was 3
almost whispering now, with a huskiness more terrible than a scream, and I 3
trembled as I listened. 3
3
"As I says, 'tis queer haow picters sets ye thinkin'. D'ye know, young Sir, I'm 3
right sot on this un here. Arter I got the book off Eb I uster look at it a lot, 3
especial when I'd heerd Passon Clark rant o' Sundays in his big wig. Onct I tried 3
suthin' funny - here, young Sir, don't git skeert - all I done was ter look at the 3
picter afore I kilt the sheep for market - killin' sheep was kinder more fun arter 3
lookin' at it - " The tone of the old man now sank very low, sometimes becoming 3
so faint that his words were hardly audible. I listened to the rain, and to the 3
rattling of the bleared, small-paned windows, and marked a rumbling of 3
approaching thunder quite unusual for the season. Once a terrific flash and peal 3
shook the frail house to its foundations, but the whisperer seemed not to notice 3
it. 3
3
"Killin' sheep was kinder more fun - but d'ye know, 'twan't quite satisfyin'. 3
Queer haow a cravin' gits a holt on ye - As ye love the Almighty, young man, 3
don't tell nobody, but I swar ter Gawd thet picter begun to make me hungry fer 3
victuals I couldn't raise nor buy - here, set still, what's ailin' ye? - I didn't do 3
nothin', only I wondered haow 'twud be ef I did - They say meat makes blood 3

3
an' flesh, an' gives ye new life, so I wondered ef 'twudn't make a man live longer 3
an' longer ef 'twas more the same - " But the whisperer never continued. The 3
interruption was not produced by my fright, nor by the rapidly increasing storm 3
amidst whose fury I was presently to open my eyes on a smoky solitude of 3
blackened ruins. It was produced by a very simple though somewhat unusual 3
happening. 3
3
The open book lay flat between us, with the picture staring repulsively upward. 3
As the old man whispered the words "more the same" a tiny splattering impact 3
was heard, and something showed on the yellowed paper of the upturned 3
volume. I thought of the rain and of a leaky roof, but rain is not red. On the 3
butcher's shop of the Anzique cannibals a small red spattering glistened 3
picturesquely, lending vividness to the horror of the engraving. The old man saw 3
it, and stopped whispering even before my expression of horror made it 3
necessary; saw it and glanced quickly toward the floor of the room he had left an 3
hour before. I followed his glance, and beheld just above us on the loose plaster 3
of the ancient ceiling a large irregular spot of wet crimson which seemed to 3
spread even as I viewed it. I did not shriek or move, but merely shut my eyes. A 3
moment later came the titanic thunderbolt of thunderbolts; blasting that accursed 3
house of unutterable secrets and bringing the oblivion which alone saved my 3
mind. 3

The Quest of Iranon 3
3
Written on Feb 28, 1921 3
3
Published in July through August of 1935 in The Galleon 3
3
Into the granite city of Teloth wandered the youth, vine-crowned, his yellow hair 3
glistening with myrrh and his purple robe torn with briers of the mountain 3
Sidrak that lies across the antique bridge of stone. The men of Teloth are dark 3
and stern, and dwell in square houses, and with frowns they asked the stranger 3
whence he had come and what were his name and fortune. So the youth 3
answered: 3
3
"I am Iranon, and come from Air a, a far city that I recall only dimly but seek to 3
find again. I am a singer of songs that I learned in the far city, and my calling is 3
to make beauty with the things remembered of childhood. My wealth is in little 3
memories and dreams, and in hopes that I sing in gardens when the moon is 3
tender and the west wind stirs the lotus-buds." 3
3
When the men of Teloth heard these things they whispered to one another; for 3
though in the granite city there is no laughter or song, the stern men sometimes 3
look to the Karthian hills in the spring and think of the lutes of distant Oonai 3
whereof travellers have told. And thinking thus, they bade the stranger stay and 3
sing in the square before the Tower of Mlin, though they liked not the colour of 3
his tattered robe, nor the myrrh in his hair, nor his chaplet of vine-leaves, nor the 3
youth in his golden voice. At evening Iranon sang, and while he sang an old man 3
prayed and a blind man said he saw a nimbus over the singer's head. But most of 3
the men of Teloth yawned, and some laughed and some went to sleep; for Iranon 3
told nothing useful, singing only his memories, his dreams, and his hopes. 3
3
"I remember the twilight, the moon, and soft songs, and the window where I was 3
rocked to sleep. And through the window was the street where the golden lights 3
came, and where the shadows danced on houses of marble. I remember the 3
square of moonlight on the floor, that was not like any other light, and the 3
visions that danced on the moonbeams when my mother sang to me. And too, I 3
remember the sun of morning bright above the many-coloured hills in summer, 3
and the sweetness of flowers borne on the south wind that made the trees sing. 3
3
"Oh Aira, city of marble and beryl, how many are thy beauties! How I loved the 3
warm and fragrant groves across the hyline Nithra, and the falls of the tiny Kra 3
that flowed though the verdant valley! In those groves and in the vale the 3
children wove wreathes for one another, and at dusk I dreamed strange dreams 3
3
3
3
670 3
3
3
3
under the yath-trees on the mountain as I saw below me the Hghts of the city, 3
and the curving Nithra reflecting a ribbon of stars. 3
3
"And in the city were the palaces of veined and tinted marble, with golden 3
domes and painted walls, and green gardens with cerulean pools and crystal 3
fountains. Often I played in the gardens and waded in the pools, and lay and 3
dreamed among the pale flowers under the trees. And sometimes at sunset i 3
would climb the long hilly street to the citadel and the open place, and look 3
down upon Aira, the magic city of marble and beryl, splendid in a robe of golden 3
flame. 3
3
"Long have I missed thee, Aira, for i was but young when we went into exile; but 3
my father was thy King and I shall come again to thee, for it is so decreed of Fate. 3
All through seven lands have I sought thee, and some day shall I reign over thy 3
groves and gardens, thy streets and palaces, and sing to men who shall know 3
whereof I sing, and laugh not nor turn away. For I am Iranon, who was a Prince 3
in Aira." 3
3
That night the men of Teloth lodged the stranger in a stable, and in the morning 3
an archon came to him and told him to go to the shop of Athok the cobbler, and 3
be apprenticed to him. 3
3
"But I am Iranon, a singer of songs, " he said, "and have no heart for the 3
cobbler's trade." 3
3
"All in Teloth must toil," replied the archon, "for that is the law." Then said 3
Iranon: 3
3
"Wherefore do ye toil; is it not that ye may live and be happy? And if ye toil only 3
that ye may toil more, when shall happiness find you? Ye toil to live, but is not 3
life made of beauty and song? And if ye suffer no singers among you, where 3
shall be the fruits of your toil? Toil without song is like a weary journey without 3
an end. Were not death more pleasing?" But the archon was sullen and did not 3
understand, and rebuked the stranger. 3
3
"Thou art a strange youth, and I like not thy face or thy voice. The words thou 3
speakest are blasphemy, for the gods of Teloth have said that toil is good. Our 3
gods have promised us a haven of light beyond death, where shall be rest 3
without end, and crystal coldness amidst which none shall vex his mind with 3
thought or his eyes with beauty. Go thou then to Athok the cobbler or be gone 3
out of the city by sunset. All here must serve, and song is folly." 3
3
3
3
671 3
3
3
3
So Iranon went out of the stable and walked over the narrow stone streets 3
between the gloomy square house of granite, seeking something green, for all 3
was of stone. On the faces of men were frowns, but by the stone embankment 3
along the sluggish river Zuro sat a young boy with sad eyes gazing into the 3
waters to spy green budding branches washed down from the hills by the 3
freshets. And the boy said to him: 3
3
"Art thou not indeed he of whom the archons tell, who seekest a far city in a fair 3
land? I am Romnod, and borne of the blood of Teloth, but am not olf in the ways 3
of the granite city, and yearn daily for the warm groves and the distant lands of 3
beauty and song. Beyond the Karthian hills lieth Oonai, the city of lutes and 3
dancing, which men whisper of and say is both lovely and terrible.Thither would 3
I go were I old enough to find the way, and thither shouldst thou go and thou 3
wouldst sing and have men listen to thee. Let us leave the city of Teloth and fare 3
together among the hills of spring. Thou shalt shew me the ways of travel and I 3
will attend thy songs at evening when the stars one by one bring dreams to the 3
minds of dreamers. And per adventure it may be that Oonai the city of lutes and 3
dancing is even the fair Aira thou seekest, for it is told that thou hast not known 3
Aira since the old days, and a name often changeth. Let us go to Oonai, O Iranon 3
of the golden head, where men shall know our longings and welcome us as 3
brothers, nor even laugh or frown at what we say." And Iranon answered: 3
3
"Be it so, small one; if any in this stone place yearn for beauty he must seek the 3
mountains and beyond, and I would not leave thee to pine by the sluggish Zuro. 3
But think not that delight and understanding dwell just across the Karthian hills, 3
or in any spot thou canst find in a day's, or a year's, or a lustrum's journey. 3
Behold, when I was small like thee I dwelt in the valley of Narthos by the frigid 3
Xari, where none would listen to my dreams; and I told myself that when older i 3
would go to Sinara on the southern slope, and sing to smiling dromedary-men in 3
the marketplace. But when I went to Sinara i found the dromedary-men all 3
drunken and ribald, and saw that their songs were not as mine, so I travelled in a 3
barge down the Xari to onyx-walled Jaren. And the soldiers at Jaren laughed at 3
me and drave me out, so that I wandered to many cities. I have seen Stethelos 3
that is below the great cataract, and have gazed on the marsh where Sarnath once 3
stood. I have been to thraa, Ilarnek, and Kadatheron on the winding river Ai, and 3
have dwelt long in Olathoe in the land of Lomar. But though i have had listeners 3
sometimes, they have ever been few. and I know that welcome shall wait me 3
only in Aira, the city of marble and beryl where my father once ruled as King. So 3
for Aira shall we seek, though it were well to visit distant and lute-blessed oonai 3
across the Karthianhills, which may indeed be Aira, though i think not. Aira's 3
beauty is past imagining, and none can tell of it without rapture, whilist of Oonai 3
the camel-drivers whisper leeringly." 3
3
3
3
672 3
3
3
3
At the sunset Iranon and small Romnod went forth from Teloth, and for long 3
wandered amidst the green hills and cool forests. The way was rough and 3
obscure, and never did they seem nearer to oonai the city of lutes and dancing; 3
but in the dusk as the stars came out Iranon would sing of Aira and its beauties 3
and Romnod would listen, so that they were both happy after a fashion. They ate 3
plentifully of fruit and red berries, and marked not the passing of time, but many 3
years must have slipped away. Small Romnod was now not so small, and spoke 3
deeply instead of shrilly, though Iranon was always the same, and decked his 3
golden hair with vines and fragrant resins found in the woods. So it came to pass 3
that Romnod seemed older than Iranon, though he had been very small when 3
Iranon had found him watching for green budding branches in Teloth beside the 3
sluggish stone-banked Zuro. 3
3
Then one night when the moon was full the travellers came to a mountain crest 3
and looked down upon the myriad light of Oonai. Peasants had told them they 3
were near, and Iranon knew that this was not his native city of Aira. The lights of 3
Oonai were not like those of Aira; for they were harsh and glaring, while the 3
lights of Aira shine as softly and magically as shone the moonlight on the floor 3
by the window where Iranon's mother once rocked him to sleep with song. But 3
Oonai was a city of lutes and dancing, so Iranon and Romnod went down the 3
steep slope that they might find men to whom sings and dreams would bring 3
pleasure. And when they were come into the town they found rose-wreathed 3
revellers bound from house to house and leaning from windows and balconies, 3
who listened to the songs of Iranon and tossed him flowers and applauded when 3
he was done. Then for a moment did Iranon believe he had found those who 3
thought and felt even as he, though the town was not a hundredth as fair as Aira. 3
3
When dawn came Iranon looked about with dismay, for the domes of Oonai 3
were not golden in the sun, but grey and dismal. And the men of Oonai were 3
pale with revelling, and dull with wine, and unlike the radient men of Aira. But 3
because the people had thrown him blossoms and acclaimed his sings Iranon 3
stayed on, and with him Romnod, who liked the revelry of the town and wore in 3
his dark hair roses and myrtle. Often at night Iranon sang to the revellers, but he 3
was always as before, crowned only in the vine of the mountains and 3
remembering the marble streets of Aira and the hyaline Nithra. In the frescoed 3
halls of the Monarch did he sing, upon a crystal dais raised over a floor that was 3
a mirror, and as he sang, he brought pictures to his hearers till the floor seemed 3
to reflect old, beautiful, and half-remembered things instead of the wine- 3
reddened feasters who pelted him with roses. And the King bade him put away 3
his tattered purple, and clothed him in satin and cloth-of-gold, with rings of 3
green jade and bracelets of tinted ivory, and lodged him in a gilded and 3
tapestried chamber on a bed of sweet carven wood with canopies and coverlets 3
3
3
3
673 3
3
3
3
of flower-embroidered silk. Thus dwelt Iranon in Oonai, the city of lutes and 3
dancing. 3
3
It is not known how long Iranon tarried in Oonai, but one day the King brought 3
to the palace some wild whirling dancers from the Liranian desert, and dusky 3
flute-players from Drinen in the East, and after that the revellers threw their 3
roses not so much at Iranon as at the dancers and flute-players. And day by day 3
that Romnod who had been a small boy in granite Teloth grew coarser and 3
redder with wine, till he dreamed less and less, amd listened with less delight to 3
the songs of Iranon. But though Iranon was sad he ceased not to sing, and at 3
evening told again of his dreams of Aira, the city of marble and beryl. Then one 3
night the reddened and fattened Romnod snorted heavily amidst the poppied 3
silks of his banquet-couch and died writhing, whilst Iranon, pale and slender, 3
sang to himself in a far corner. And when Iranon had wept over the grave of 3
Romnod and strewn it with green branches, such as Romnod used to love, he put 3
aside his silks and gauds and went forgotten out of Oonai the city of lutes and 3
dancing clad only in the ragged purple in which he had come, and garlanded 3
with fresh vines from the mountains. 3
3
Into the sunset wandered Iranon, seeking still for his native land and for men 3
who would understand his songs and dreams. In all the cities of Cydathria and 3
in the lands beyond the Bnazie desert gay-faced children laughed at his olden 3
songs and tattered robe of purple; but Iranon stayed ever young, and wore 3
wreathes upon his golden head whilst he sang of Aira, delight of the past and 3
hope of the future. 3
3
So came he one night to the squallid cot of an antique shepherd, bent and dirty, 3
who kept flocks on a stony slope above a quicksand marsh. To this man Iranon 3
spoke, as to so many others: 3
3
"Canst thou tell me where I may find Aira, the city of marble and beryl, where 3
flows the hyaline nithra and where the falls of the tiny Kra sing to the verdant 3
valleys and hills forested with yath trees?" and the shepherd, hearing, looked 3
long and strangely at Iranon, as if recalling something very far away in time, and 3
noted each line of the stranger's face, and his golden hair, and his crown of vine- 3
leaves. But he was old, and shook his head as he replied: 3
3
"O stranger, i have indeed heard the name of Aira, and the other names thou 3
hast spoken, but they come to me from afar down the waste of long years. I heard 3
them in my youth from the lips of a playmate, a beggar's boy given to strange 3
dreams, who would weave long tales about the moon and the flowers and the 3
west wind. We used to laugh at him, for we knew him from his birth though he 3
thought himself a King's son. He was comely, even as thou, but full of folly and 3
3
3
3
674 3
3
3
3
strangeness; and he ranaway when small to find those who would listen gladly 3
to his songs and dreams. How often hath he sung to me of lands that never were, 3
and things that never can be! Of Air a did he speak much; of Aira and the river 3
Nithra, and the falls of the tiny Kra. There would he ever say he once dwelt as a 3
Prince, though here we knew him from his birth.Nor was there ever a marble city 3
of Aira, or those who could delight in strange songs, save in the dreams of mine 3
old playmate Iranon who is gone." 3
3
And in the twilight, as the stars came out one by one and the moon cast on the 3
marsh a radiance like that which a child sees quivering on the floor as he is 3
rocked to sleep at evening, there walked into the lethal quicksands a very old 3
man in tattered purple, crowned with whithered vine-leaves and gazing ahead 3
as if upon the golden domes of a fair city where dreams are understood. That 3
night something of youth and beauty died in the elder world. 3

On 16 July 1923, 1 moved into Exham Priory after the last workman had finished 3
his labours. The restoration had been a stupendous task, for little had remained 3
of the deserted pile but a shell-like ruin; yet because it had been the seat of my 3
ancestors, I let no expense deter me. The place had not been inhabited since the 3
reign of James the First, when a tragedy of intensely hideous, though largely 3
unexplained, nature had struck down the master, five of his children, and several 3
servants; and driven forth under a cloud of suspicion and terror the third son, 3
my lineal progenitor and the only survivor of the abhorred line. 3
3
With this sole heir denounced as a murderer, the estate had reverted to the 3
crown, nor had the accused man made any attempt to exculpate himself or 3
regain his property. Shaken by some horror greater than that of conscience or the 3
law, and expressing only a frantic wish to exclude the ancient edifice from his 3
sight and memory, Walter de la Poer, eleventh Baron Exham, fled to Virginia and 3
there founded the family which by the next century had become known as 3
Delapore. 3
3
Exham Priory had remained untenanted, though later allotted to the estates of 3
the Norrys family and much studied because of its peculiarly composite 3
architecture; an architecture involving Gothic towers resting on a Saxon or 3
Romanesque substructure, whose foundation in turn was of a still earlier order 3
or blend of orders — Roman, and even Druidic or native Cymric, if legends 3
speak truly. This foundation was a very singular thing, being merged on one side 3
with the solid limestone of the precipice from whose brink the priory overlooked 3
a desolate valley three miles west of the village of Anchester. 3
3
Architects and antiquarians loved to examine this strange relic of forgotten 3
centuries, but the country folk hated it. They had hated it hundreds of years 3
before, when my ancestors lived there, and they hated it now, with the moss and 3
mould of abandonment on it. I had not been a day in Anchester before I knew I 3
came of an accursed house. And this week workmen have blown up Exham 3
Priory, and are busy obliterating the traces of its foundations. The bare statistics 3
of my ancestry I had always known, together with the fact that my first 3
American forebear had come to the colonies under a strange cloud. Of details, 3
however, I had been kept wholly ignorant through the policy of reticence always 3
maintained by the Delapores. Unlike our planter neighbours, we seldom boasted 3
3
3
3
676 3
3
3
3
of crusading ancestors or other mediaeval and Renaissance heroes; nor was any 3
kind of tradition handed down except what may have been recorded in the 3
sealed envelope left before the Civil War by every squire to his eldest son for 3
posthumous opening. The glories we cherished were those achieved since the 3
migration; the glories of a proud and honourable, if somewhat reserved and 3
unsocial Virginia line. 3
3
During the war our fortunes were extinguished and our whole existence changed 3
by the burning of Carfax, our home on the banks of the James. My grandfather, 3
advanced in years, had perished in that incendiary outrage, and with him the 3
envelope that had bound us all to the past. I can recall that fire today as I saw it 3
then at the age of seven, with the federal soldiers shouting, the women 3
screaming, and the negroes howling and praying. My father was in the army, 3
defending Richmond, and after many formalities my mother and I were passed 3
through the lines to join him. 3
3
When the war ended we all moved north, whence my mother had come; and I 3
grew to manhood, middle age, and ultimate wealth as a stolid Yankee. Neither 3
my father nor I ever knew what our hereditary envelope had contained, and as I 3
merged into the greyness of Massachusetts business life I lost all interest in the 3
mysteries which evidently lurked far back in my family tree. Had I suspected 3
their nature, how gladly I would have left Exham Priory to its moss, bats and 3
cobwebs! 3
3
My father died in 1904, but without any message to leave to me, or to my only 3
child, Alfred, a motherless boy of ten. It was this boy who reversed the order of 3
family information, for although I could give him only jesting conjectures about 3
the past, he wrote me of some very interesting ancestral legends when the late 3
war took him to England in 1917 as an aviation officer. Apparently the Delapores 3
had a colourful and perhaps sinister history, for a friend of my son's, Capt. 3
Edward Norrys of the Royal Flying Corps, dwelt near the family seat at 3
Anchester and related some peasant superstitions which few novelists could 3
equal for wildness and incredibility. Norrys himself, of course, did not take them 3
so seriously; but they amused my son and made good material for his letters to 3
me. It was this legendry which definitely turned my attention to my transatlantic 3
heritage, and made me resolve to purchase and restore the family seat which 3
Norrys showed to Alfred in its picturesque desertion, and offered to get for him 3
at a surprisingly reasonable figure, since his own uncle was the present owner. 3
3
I bought Exham Priory in 1918, but was almost immediately distracted from my 3
plans of restoration by the return of my son as a maimed invalid. During the two 3
years that he lived I thought of nothing but his care, having even placed my 3
business under the direction of partners. 3
3
3
3
677 3
3
3
3
In 1921, as I found myself bereaved and aimless, a retired manufacturer no 3
longer young, I resolved to divert my remaining years with my new possession. 3
Visiting Anchester in December, I was entertained by Capt. Norrys, a plump, 3
amiable young man who had thought much of my son, and secured his 3
assistance in gathering plans and anecdotes to guide in the coming restoration. 3
Exham Priory itself I saw without emotion, a jumble of tottering mediaeval ruins 3
covered with lichens and honeycombed with rooks' nests, perched perilously 3
upon a precipice, and denuded of floors or other interior features save the stone 3
walls of the separate towers. 3
3
As I gradually recovered the image of the edifice as it had been when my 3
ancestors left it over three centuries before, I began to hire workmen for the 3
reconstruction. In every case I was forced to go outside the immediate locality, 3
for the Anchester villagers had an almost unbelievable fear and hatred of the 3
place. The sentiment was so great that it was sometimes communicated to the 3
outside labourers, causing numerous desertions; whilst its scope appeared to 3
include both the priory and its ancient family. 3
3
My son had told me that he was somewhat avoided during his visits because he 3
was a de la Poer, and I now found myself subtly ostracized for a like reason until 3
I convinced the peasants how little I knew of my heritage. Even then they 3
sullenly disliked me, so that I had to collect most of the village traditions through 3
the mediation of Norrys. What the people could not forgive, perhaps, was that I 3
had come to restore a symbol so abhorrent to them; for, rationally or not, they 3
viewed Exham Priory as nothing less than a haunt of fiends and werewolves. 3
3
Piecing together the tales which Norrys collected for me, and supplementing 3
them with the accounts of several savants who had studied the ruins, I deduced 3
that Exham Priory stood on the site of a prehistoric temple; a Druidical or ante- 3
Druidical thing which must have been contemporary with Stonehenge. That 3
indescribable rites had been celebrated there, few doubted, and there were 3
unpleasant tales of the transference of these rites into the Cybele worship which 3
the Romans had introduced. 3
3
Inscriptions still visible in the sub-cellar bore such unmistakable letters as 'DIV... 3
OPS ... MAGNA. MAT...', sign of the Magna Mater whose dark worship was 3
once vainly forbidden to Roman citizens. Anchester had been the camp of the 3
third Augustan legion, as many remains attest, and it was said that the temple of 3
Cybele was splendid and thronged with worshippers who performed nameless 3
ceremonies at the bidding of a Phrygian priest. Tales added that the fall of the 3
old religion did not end the orgies at the temple, but that the priests lived on in 3
the new faith without real change. Likewise was it said that the rites did not 3
vanish with the Roman power, and that certain among the Saxons added to what 3
3
3
3
678 3
3
3
3
remained of the temple, and gave it the essential outline it subsequently 3
preserved, making it the centre of a cult feared through half the heptarchy. 3
About 1000 A.D. the place is mentioned in a chronicle as being a substantial 3
stone priory housing a strange and powerful monastic order and surrounded by 3
extensive gardens which needed no walls to exclude a frightened populace. It 3
was never destroyed by the Danes, though after the Norman Conquest it must 3
have declined tremendously, since there was no impediment when Henry the 3
Third granted the site to my ancestor, Gilbert de la Poer, First Baron Exham, in 3
1261. 3
3
Of my family before this date there is no evil report, but something strange must 3
have happened then. In one chronicle there is a reference to a de la Poer as 3
"cursed of God in 1307", whilst village legendry had nothing but evil and frantic 3
fear to tell of the castle that went up on the foundations of the old temple and 3
priory. The fireside tales were of the most grisly description, all the ghastlier 3
because of their frightened reticence and cloudy evasiveness. They represented 3
my ancestors as a race of hereditary daemons beside whom Gilles de Retz and 3
the Marquis de Sade would seem the veriest tyros, and hinted whisperingly at 3
their responsibility for the occasional disappearances of villagers through several 3
generations. 3
3
The worst characters, apparently, were the barons and their direct heirs; at least, 3
most was whispered about these. If of healthier inclinations, it was said, an heir 3
would early and mysteriously die to make way for another more typical scion. 3
There seemed to be an inner cult in the family, presided over by the head of the 3
house, and sometimes closed except to a few members. Temperament rather than 3
ancestry was evidently the basis of this cult, for it was entered by several who 3
married into the family. Lady Margaret Trevor from Cornwall, wife of Godfrey, 3
the second son of the fifth baron, became a favourite bane of children all over the 3
countryside, and the daemon heroine of a particularly horrible old ballad not yet 3
extinct near the Welsh border. Preserved in balladry, too, though not illustrating 3
the same point, is the hideous tale of Lady Mary de la Poer, who shortly after her 3
marriage to the Earl of Shrewsfield was killed by him and his mother, both of the 3
slayers being absolved and blessed by the priest to whom they confessed what 3
they dared not repeat to the world. 3

These myths and ballads, typical as they were of crude superstition, repelled me 3
greatly. Their persistence, and their application to so long a line of my ancestors, 3
were especially annoying; whilst the imputations of monstrous habits proved 3
unpleasantly reminiscent of the one known scandal of my immediate forebears 3
— the case of my cousin, young Randolph Delapore of Carfax who went among 3
the negroes and became a voodoo priest after he returned from the Mexican War. 3

I was much less disturbed by the vaguer tales of wails and bowlings in tbe 3
barren, windswept valley beneath the limestone cliff; of the graveyard stenches 3
after the spring rains; of the floundering, squealing white thing on which Sir John 3
Clave's horse had trod one night in a lonely field; and of the servant who had 3
gone mad at what he saw in the priory in the full light of day. These things were 3
hackneyed spectral lore, and I was at that time a pronounced sceptic. The 3
accounts of vanished peasants were less to be dismissed, though not especially 3
significant in view of mediaeval custom. Prying curiosity meant death, and more 3
than one severed head had been publicly shown on the bastions — now effaced 3
— around Exham Priory. 3
3
A few of the tales were exceedingly picturesque, and made me wish I had learnt 3
more of the comparative mythology in my youth. There was, for instance, the 3
belief that a legion of bat-winged devils kept witches' sabbath each night at the 3
priory — a legion whose sustenance might explain the disproportionate 3
abundance of coarse vegetables harvested in the vast gardens. And, most vivid 3
of all, there was the dramatic epic of the rats — the scampering army of obscene 3
vermin which had burst forth from the castle three months after the tragedy that 3
doomed it to desertion — the lean, filthy, ravenous army which had swept all 3
before it and devoured fowl, cats, dogs, hogs, sheep, and even two hapless 3
human beings before its fury was spent. Around that unforgettable rodent army 3
a whole separate cycle of myths revolves, for it scattered among the village 3
homes and brought curses and horrors in its train. 3
3
Such was the lore that assailed me as I pushed to completion, with an elderly 3
obstinacy, the work of restoring my ancestral home. It must not be imagined for 3
a moment that these tales formed my principal psychological environinent. On 3
the other hand, I was constantly praised and encouraged by Capt. Norrys and 3
the antiquarians who surrounded and aided me. When the task was done, over 3
two years after its commencement, I viewed the great rooms, wainscoted walls, 3
vaulted ceilings, mullioned windows, and broad staircases with a pride which 3
fully compensated for the prodigious expense of the restoration. 3
3
Every attribute of the Middle Ages was cunningly reproduced and the new parts 3
blended perfectly with the original walls and foundations. The seat of my fathers 3
was complete, and I looked forward to redeeming at last the local fame of the 3
line which ended in me. I could reside here permanently, and prove that a de la 3
Poer (for I had adopted again the original spelling of the name) need not be a 3
fiend. My comfort was perhaps augmented by the fact that, although Exham 3
Priory was mediaevally fitted, its interior was in truth wholly new and free from 3
old vermin and old ghosts alike. 3

As I have said, I moved in on 16 July 1923. My household consisted of seven 3
servants and nine cats, of which latter species I am particularly fond. My eldest 3
cat, "Nigger-Man", was seven years old and had come with me from my home in 3
Bolton, Massachusetts; the others I had accumulated whilst living with Capt. 3
Norrys' family during the restoration of the priory. 3
3
For five days our routine proceeded with the utmost placidity, my time being 3
spent mostly in the codification of old family data. I had now obtained some very 3
circumstantial accounts of the final tragedy and flight of Walter de la Poer, which 3
I conceived to be the probable contents of the hereditary paper lost in the fire at 3
Carfax. It appeared that my ancestor was accused with much reason of having 3
killed all the other members of his household, except four servant confederates, 3
in their sleep, about two weeks after a shocking discovery which changed his 3
whole demeanour, but which, except by implication, he disclosed to no one save 3
perhaps the servants who assisted him and afterwards fled beyond reach. 3
3
This deliberate slaughter, which included a father, three brothers, and two 3
sisters, was largely condoned by the villagers, and so slackly treated by the law 3
that its perpetrator escaped honoured, unharmed, and undisguised to Virginia; 3
the general whispered sentiment being that he had purged the land of an 3
immemorial curse. What discovery had prompted an act so terrible, I could 3
scarcely even conjecture. Walter de la Poer must have known for years the 3
sinister tales about his family, so that this material could have given him no fresh 3
impulse. Had he, then, witnessed some appalling ancient rite, or stumbled upon 3
some frightful and revealing symbol in the priory or its vicinity? He was reputed 3
to have been a shy, gentle youth in England. In Virginia he seemed not so much 3
hard or bitter as harassed and apprehensive. He was spoken of in the diary of 3
another gentleman adventurer, Francis Harley of Bellview, as a man of 3
unexampled justice, honour, and delicacy. 3
3
On 22 July occurred the first incident which, though lightly dismissed at the 3
time, takes on a preternatural significance in relation to later events. It was so 3
simple as to be almost negligible, and could not possibly have been noticed 3
under the circumstances; for it must be recalled that since I was in a building 3
practically fresh and new except for the walls, and surrounded by a well- 3
balanced staff of servitors, apprehension would have been absurd despite the 3
locality. 3
3
What I afterward remembered is merely this — that my old black cat, whose 3
moods I know so well, was undoubtedly alert and anxious to an extent wholly 3
out of keeping with his natural character. He roved from room to room, restless 3
and disturbed, and sniffed constantly about the walls which formed part of the 3
Gothic structure. I realize how trite this sounds — like the inevitable dog in the 3
3
3
3
681 3
3
3
3
ghost story, which always growls before his master sees the sheeted figure — yet 3
I cannot consistently suppress it. 3
3
The following day a servant complained of restlessness among all the cats in the 3
house. He came to me in my study, a lofty west room on the second storey, with 3
groined arches, black oak panelling, and a triple Gothic window overlooking the 3
limestone cliff and desolate valley; and even as he spoke I saw the jetty form of 3
Nigger-Man creeping along the west wall and scratching at the new panels 3
which overlaid the ancient stone. 3
3
I told the man that there must be a singular odour or emanation from the old 3
stonework, imperceptible to human senses, but affecting the delicate organs of 3
cats even through the new woodwork. This I truly believed, and when the fellow 3
suggested the presence of mice or rats, I mentioned that there had been no rats 3
there for three hundred years, and that even the field mice of the surrounding 3
country could hardly be found in these high walls, where they had never been 3
known to stray. That afternoon I called on Capt. Norrys, and he assured me that 3
it would be quite incredible for field mice to infest the priory in such a sudden 3
and unprecedented fashion. 3
3
That night, dispensing as usual with a valet, I retired in the west tower chamber 3
which I had chosen as my own, reached from the study by a stone staircase and 3
short gallery — the former partly ancient, the latter entirely restored. This room 3
was circular, very high, and without wainscoting, being hung with arras which I 3
had myself chosen in London. 3
3
Seeing that Nigger-Man was with me, I shut the heavy Gothic door and retired 3
by the light of the electric bulbs which so cleverly counterfeited candles, finally 3
switching off the light and sinking on the carved and canopied four-poster, with 3
the venerable cat in his accustomed place across my feet. I did not draw the 3
curtains, but gazed out at the narrow window which I faced. There was a 3
suspicion of aurora in the sky, and the delicate traceries of the window were 3
pleasantly silhouetted. 3
3
At some time I must have fallen quietly asleep, for I recall a distinct sense of 3
leaving strange dreams, when the cat started violently from his placid position. I 3
saw him in the faint auroral glow, head strained forward, fore feet on my ankles, 3
and hind feet stretched behind. He was looking intensely at a point on the wall 3
somewhat west of the window, a point which to my eye had nothing to mark it, 3
but toward which all my attention was now directed. 3
3
And as I watched, I knew that Nigger-Man was not vainly excited. Whether the 3
arras actually moved I cannot say. I think it did, very slightly. But what I can 3
3
3
3
682 3
3
3
3
swear to is that behind it I heard a low, distinct scurrying as of rats or mice. In a 3
moment the cat had jumped bodily on the screening tapestry, bringing the 3
affected section to the floor with his weight, and exposing a damp, ancient wall 3
of stone; patched here and there by the restorers, and devoid of any trace of 3
rodent prowlers. 3
3
Nigger-Man raced up and down the floor by this part of the wall, clawing the 3
fallen arras and seemingly trying at times to insert a paw between the wall and 3
the oaken floor. He found nothing, and after a time returned wearily to his place 3
across my feet. I had not moved, but I did not sleep again that night. 3
3
In the morning I questioned all the servants, and found that none of them had 3
noticed anything unusual, save that the cook remembered the actions of a cat 3
which had rested on her windowsill. This cat had howled at some unknown 3
hour of the night, awaking the cook in time for her to see him dart purposefully 3
out of the open door down the stairs. I drowsed away the noontime, and in the 3
afternoon called again on Capt. Norrys, who became exceedingly interested in 3
what I told him. The odd incidents — so slight yet so curious — appealed to his 3
sense of the picturesque and elicited from him a number of reminiscenses of local 3
ghostly lore. We were genuinely perplexed at the presence of rats, and Norrys 3
lent me some traps and Paris green, which I had the servants place in strategic 3
localities when I returned. 3
3
I retired early, being very sleepy, but was harassed by dreams of the most 3
horrible sort. I seemed to be looking down from an immense height upon a twilit 3
grotto, knee-deep with filth, where a white-bearded daemon swineherd drove 3
about with his staff a flock of fungous, flabby beasts whose appearance filled me 3
with unutterable loathing. Then, as the swineherd paused and nodded over his 3
task, a mighty swarm of rats rained down on the stinking abyss and fell to 3
devouring beasts and man alike. 3
3
From this terrific vision I was abruptly awakened by the motions of Nigger-Man, 3
who had been sleeping as usual across my feet. This time I did not have to 3
question the source of his snarls and hisses, and of the fear which made him sink 3
his claws into my ankle, unconscious of their effect; for on every side of the 3
chamber the walls were alive with nauseous sound — the veminous slithering of 3
ravenous, gigantic rats. There was now no aurora to show the state of the arras 3
— the fallen section of which had been replaced - but I was not too frightened to 3
switch on the light. 3
3
As the bulbs leapt into radiance I saw a hideous shaking all over the tapestry, 3
causing the somewhat peculiar designs to execute a singular dance of death. This 3
motion disappeared almost at once, and the sound with it. Springing out of bed, I 3
3
3
3
683 3
3
3
3
poked at the arras with the long handle of a warming-pan that rested near, and 3
lifted one section to see what lay beneath. There was nothing but the patched 3
stone wall, and even the cat had lost his tense realization of abnormal presences. 3
When I examined the circular trap that had been placed in the room, I found all 3
of the openings sprung, though no trace remained of what had been caught and 3
had escaped. 3
3
Further sleep was out of the question, so lighting a candle, I opened the door and 3
went out in the gallery towards the stairs to my study, Nigger-Man following at 3
my heels. Before we had reached the stone steps, however, the cat darted ahead 3
of me and vanished down the ancient flight. As I descended the stairs myself, I 3
became suddenly aware of sounds in the great room below; sounds of a nature 3
which could not be mistaken. 3
3
The oak-panelled walls were alive with rats, scampering and milling whilst 3
Nigger-Man was racing about with the fury of a baffled hunter. Reaching the 3
bottom, I switched on the light, which did not this time cause the noise to 3
subside. The rats continued their riot, stampeding with such force and 3
distinctness that I could finally assign to their motions a definite direction. These 3
creatures, in numbers apparently inexhaustible, were engaged in one stupendous 3
migration from inconceivable heights to some depth conceivably or 3
inconceivably below. 3
3
I now heard steps in the corridor, and in another moment two servants pushed 3
open the massive door. They were searching the house for some unknown source 3
of disturbance which had thrown all the cats into a snarling panic and caused 3
them to plunge precipitately down several flights of stairs and squat, yowling, 3
before the closed door to the sub-cellar. I asked them if they had heard the rats, 3
but they replied in the negative. And when I turned to call their attention to the 3
sounds in the panels, I realized that the noise had ceased. 3
3
With the two men, I went down to the door of the sub-cellar, but found the cats 3
already dispersed. Later I resolved to explore the crypt below, but for the present 3
I merely made a round of the traps. All were sprung, yet all were tenantless. 3
Satisfying myself that no one had heard the rats save the felines and me, I sat in 3
my study till morning, thinking profoundly and recalling every scrap of legend I 3
had unearthed concerning the building I inhabited. I slept some in the forenoon, 3
leaning back in the one comfortable library chair which my mediaeval plan of 3
furnishing could not banish. Later I telephoned to Capt. Norrys, who came over 3
and helped me explore the sub-cellar. 3
3
Absolutely nothing untoward was found, although we could not repress a thrill 3
at the knowledge that this vault was built by Roman hands. Every low arch and 3
3
3
3
684 3
3
3
3
massive pillar was Roman — not the debased Romanesque of the bungling 3
Saxons, but the severe and harmonious classicism of the age of the Caesars; 3
indeed, the walls abounded with inscriptions familiar to the antiquarians who 3
had repeatedly explored the place — things like "P. GETAE. PROP... TEMP... 3
DONA. . ." and "L. PRAEG. . . VS. . . PONTIFI. . . ATYS. . ." 3
3
The reference to Atys made me shiver, for I had read Catullus and knew 3
something of the hideous rites of the Eastern god, whose worship was so mixed 3
with that of Cybele. Norrys and I, by the light of lanterns, tried to interpret the 3
odd and nearly effaced designs on certain irregularly rectangular blocks of stone 3
generally held to be altars, but could make nothing of them. We remembered 3
that one pattern, a sort of rayed sun, was held by students to imply a non-Roman 3
origin suggesting that these altars had merely been adopted by the Roman 3
priests from some older and perhaps aboriginal temple on the same site. On one 3
of these blocks were some brown stains which made me wonder. The largest, in 3
the centre of the room, had certain features on the upper surface which indicated 3
its connection with fire — probably burnt offerings. 3
3
Such were the sights in that crypt before whose door the cats howled, and where 3
Norrys and I now determined to pass the night. Couches were brought down by 3
the servants, who were told not to mind any nocturnal actions of the cats, and 3
Nigger-Man was admitted as much for help as for companionship. We decided 3
to keep the great oak door — a modern replica with slits for ventilation — tightly 3
closed; and, with this attended to, we retired with lanterns still burning to await 3
whatever might occur. 3
3
The vault was very deep in the foundations of the priory, and undoubtedly far 3
down on the face of the beetling limestone cliff overlooking the waste valley. 3
That it had been the goal of the scuffling and unexplainable rats I could not 3
doubt, though why, I could not tell. As we lay there expectantly, I found my vigil 3
occasionally mixed with half-formed dreams from which the uneasy motions of 3
the cat across my feet would rouse me. 3
3
These dreams were not wholesome, but horribly like the one I had had the night 3
before. I saw again the twilit grotto, and the swineherd with his unmentionable 3
fungous beasts wallowing in filth, and as I looked at these things they seemed 3
nearer and more distinct — so distinct that I could almost observe their features. 3
Then I did observe the flabby features of one of them — and awakened with such 3
a scream that Nigger-Man started up, whilst Capt. Norrys, who had not slept, 3
laughed considerably. Norrys might have laughed more — or perhaps less — 3
had he known what it was that made me scream. But I did not remember myself 3
till later. Ultimate horror often paralyses memory in a merciful way. 3
3
3
3
685 3
3
3
3
Norrys waked me when the phenomena began. Out of the same frightful dream I 3
was called by his gentle shaking and his urging to listen to the cats. Indeed, there 3
was much to listen to, for beyond the closed door at the head of the stone steps 3
was a veritable nightmare of feline yelling and clawing, whilst Nigger-Man, 3
unmindful of his kindred outside, was running excitedly round the bare stone 3
walls, in which I heard the same babel of scurrying rats that had troubled me the 3
night before. 3
3
An acute terror now rose within me, for here were anomalies which nothing 3
normal could well explain. These rats, if not the creatures of a madness which I 3
shared with the cats alone, must be burrowing and sliding in Roman walls I had 3
thought to be solid limestone blocks ... unless perhaps the action of water 3
through more than seventeen centuries had eaten winding tunnels which rodent 3
bodies had worn clear and ample . . . But even so, the spectral horror was no less; 3
for if these were living vermin why did not Norrys hear their disgusting 3
commotion? Why did he urge me to watch Nigger-Man and listen to the cats 3
outside, and why did he guess wildly and vaguely at what could have aroused 3
them? 3
3
By the time I had managed to tell him, as rationally as I could, what I thought I 3
was hearing, my ears gave me the last fading impression of scurrying; which had 3
retreated still downward, far underneath this deepest of sub-cellars till it seemed 3
as if the whole cliff below were riddled with questing rats. Norrys was not as 3
sceptical as I had anticipated, but instead seemed profoundly moved. He 3
motioned to me to notice that the cats at the door had ceased their clamour, as if 3
giving up the rats for lost; whilst Nigger-Man had a burst of renewed 3
restlessness, and was clawing frantically around the bottom of the large stone 3
altar in the centre of the room, which was nearer Norrys' couch than mine. 3
3
My fear of the unknown was at this point very great. Something astounding had 3
occurred, and I saw that Capt. Norrys, a younger, stouter, and presumably more 3
naturally materialistic man, was affected fully as much as myself — perhaps 3
because of his lifelong and intimate familiarity with local legend. We could for 3
the moment do nothing but watch the old black cat as he pawed with decreasing 3
fervour at the base of the altar, occasionally looking up and mewing to me in that 3
persuasive manner which he used when he wished me to perform some favour 3
for him. 3
3
Norrys now took a lantern close to the altar and examined the place where 3
Nigger-Man was pawing; silently kneeling and scraping away the lichens of the 3
centuries which joined the massive pre-Roman block to the tessellated floor. He 3
did not find anything, and was about to abandon his efforts when I noticed a 3
3
3
3
686 3
3
3
3
trivial circumstance which made me shudder, even though it impHed nothing 3
more than I had aheady imagined. 3
3
I told him of it, and we both looked at its almost imperceptible manifestation 3
with the fixedness of fascinated discovery and acknowledgment. It was only this 3
— that the flame of the lantern set down near the altar was slightly but certainly 3
flickering from a draught of air which it had not before received, and which 3
came indubitably from the crevice between floor and altar where Norrys was 3
scraping away the lichens. 3
3
We spent the rest of the night in the brilliantly-lighted study, nervously 3
discussing what we should do next. The discovery that some vault deeper than 3
the deepest known masonry of the Romans underlay this accursed pile, some 3
vault unsuspected by the curious antiquarians of three centuries, would have 3
been sufficient to excite us without any background of the sinister. As it was, the 3
fascination became two-fold; and we paused in doubt whether to abandon our 3
search and quit the priory forever in superstitious caution, or to gratify our sense 3
of adventure and brave whatever horrors might await us in the unknown depths. 3
3
By morning we had compromised, and decided to go to London to gather a 3
group of archaeologists and scientific men fit to cope with the mystery. It should 3
be mentioned that before leaving the sub-cellar we had vainly tried to move the 3
central altar which we now recognized as the gate to a new pit of nameless fear. 3
What secret would open the gate, wiser men than we would have to find. 3
3
During many days in London Capt. Norrys and I presented our facts, 3
conjectures, and legendary anecdotes to five eminent authorities, all men who 3
could be trusted to respect any family disclosures which future explorations 3
might develop. We found most of them little disposed to scoff but, instead, 3
intensely interested and sincerely sympathetic. It is hardly necessary to name 3
them all, but I may say that they included Sir William Brinton, whose 3
excavations in the Troad excited most of the world in their day. As we all took 3
the train for Anchester I felt myself poised on the brink of frightful revelations, a 3
sensation symbolized by the air of mourning among the many Americans at the 3
unexpected death of the President on the other side of the world. 3
3
On the evening of 7 August we reached Exham Priory, where the servants 3
assured me that nothing unusual had occurred. The cats, even old Nigger-Man, 3
had been perfectly placid, and not a trap in the house had been sprung. We were 3
to begin exploring on the following dlay, awaiting which I assigned well- 3
appointed rooms to all my guests. 3
3
3
3
687 3
3
3
3
I myself retired in my own tower chamber, with Nigger-Man across my feet. 3
Sleep came quickly, but hideous dreams assailed me. There was a vision of a 3
Roman feast like that of Trimalchio, with a horror in a covered platter. Then 3
came that damnable, recurrent thing about the swineherd and his filthy drove in 3
the twilit grotto. Yet when I awoke it was full daylight, with normal sounds in 3
the house below. The rats, living or spectral, had not troubled me; and Nigger- 3
Man was still quietly asleep. On going down, I found that the same tranquillity 3
had prevailed elsewhere; a condition which one of the assembled servants — a 3
fellow named Thornton, devoted to the psychic — rather absurdly laid to the fact 3
that I had now been shown the thing which certain forces had wished to show 3
me. 3
3
All was now ready, and at 11 A.M. our entire group of seven men, bearing 3
powerful electric searchlights and implements of excavation, went down to the 3
sub-cellar and bolted the door behind us. Nigger-Man was with us, for the 3
investigators found no occasion to depise his excitability, and were indeed 3
anxious that he be present in case of obscure rodent manifestations. We noted the 3
Roman inscriptions and unknown altar designs only briefly, for three of the 3
savants had already seen them, and all knew their characteristics. Prime 3
attention was paid to the momentous central altar, and within an hour Sir 3
William Brinton had caused it to tilt backward, balanced by some unknown 3
species of counterweight. 3
3
There now lay revealed such a horror as would have overwhelmed us had we 3
not been prepared. Through a nearly square opening in the tiled floor, sprawling 3
on a flight of stone steps so prodigiously worn that it was little more than an 3
inclined plane at the centre, was a ghastly array of human or semi-human bones. 3
Those which retained their collocation as skeletons showed attitudes of panic 3
fear, and over all were the marks of rodent gnawing. The skulls denoted nothing 3
short of utter idiocy, cretinism, or primitive semi-apedom. 3
3
Above the hellishly littered steps arched a descending passage seemingly 3
chiselled from the solid rock, and conducting a current of air. This current was 3
not a sudden and noxious rush as from a closed vault, but a cool breeze with 3
something of freshness in it. We did not pause long, but shiveringly began to 3
clear a passage down the steps. It was then that Sir William, examining the hewn 3
walls, made the odd observation that the passage, according to the direction of 3
the strokes, must have been chiselled from beneath. 3
3
I must be very deliberate now, and choose my words. After ploughing down a 3
few steps amidst the gnawled bones we saw that there was light ahead; not any 3
mystic phosphorescence, but a filtered daylight which could not come except 3
from unknown fissures in the cliff that over-looked the waste valley. That such 3
3
3
3
688 3
3
3
3
fissures had escaped notice from outside was hardly remarkable, for not only is 3
the valley wholly uninhabited, but the cliff is so high and beetling that only an 3
aeronaut could study its face in detail. A few steps more, and our breaths were 3
literally snatched from us by what we saw; so literally that Thornton, the psychic 3
investigator, actually fainted in the arms of the dazed mem who stood behind 3
him. Norrys, his plump face utterly white and flabby, simply cried out 3
inarticulately; whilst I think that what I did was to gasp or hiss, and cover my 3
eyes. 3
3
The man behind me — the only one of the party older than I — croaked the 3
hackneyed "My God!" in the most cracked voice I ever heard. Of seven 3
cultivated men, only Sir William Brinton retained his composure, a thing the 3
more to his credit because he led the party and must have seen the sight first. 3
3
It was a twilit grotto of enormous height, stretching away farther than any eye 3
could see; a subterraneous world of limitless mystery and horrible suggestion. 3
There were buildings and other architectural remains — in one terrified glance I 3
saw a weird pattern of tumuli, a savage circle of monoliths, a low-domed Roman 3
ruin, a sprawling Saxon pile, and an early English edifice of wood — but all these 3
were dwarfed by the ghoulish spectacle presented by the general surface of the 3
ground. For yards about the steps extended an insane tangle of human bones, or 3
bones at least as human as those on the steps. Like a foamy sea they stretched, 3
some fallen apart, but others wholly or partly articulated as skeletons; these latter 3
invariably in postures of daemoniac frenzy, either fighting off some menace or 3
clutching other forms with cannibal intent. 3
3
When Dr Trask, the anthropologist, stopped to classify the skulls, he found a 3
degraded mixture which utterly baffled him. They were mostly lower than the 3
Piltdown man in the scale of evolution, but in every case definitely human. Many 3
were of higher grade, and a very few were the skulls of supremely and 3
sensitively developed types. All the bones were gnawed, mostly by rats, but 3
somewhat by others of the half-human drove. Mixed with them were many tiny 3
hones of rats — fallen members of the lethal army which closed the ancient epic. 3
3
I wonder that any man among us lived and kept his sanity through that hideous 3
day of discovery. Not Hoffman nor Huysmans could conceive a scene more 3
wildly incredible, more frenetically repellent, or more Gothically grotesque than 3
the twilit grotto through which we seven staggered; each stumbling on 3
revelation after revelation, and trying to keep for the nonce from thinking of the 3
events which must have taken place there three hundred, or a thousand, or two 3
thousand or ten thousand years ago. It was the antechamber of hell, and poor 3
Thornton fainted again when Trask told him that some of the skeleton things 3
3
3
3
689 3
3
3
3
must have descended as quadrupeds through the last twenty or more 3
generations. 3
3
Horror piled on horror as we began to interpret the architectural remains. The 3
quadruped things — with their occasional recruits from the biped class — had 3
been kept in stone pens, out of which they must have broken in their last 3
delirium of hunger or rat-fear. There had been great herds of them, evidently 3
fattened on the coarse vegetables whose remains could be found as a sort of 3
poisonous ensilage at the bottom of the huge stone bins older than Rome. I knew 3
now why my ancestors had had such excessive gardens — would to heaven I 3
could forget! The purpose of the herds I did not have to ask. 3
3
Sir William, standing with his searchlight in the Roman ruin, translated aloud 3
the most shocking ritual I have ever known; and told of the diet of the 3
antediluvian cult which the priests of Cybele found and mingled with their own. 3
Norrys, used as he was to the trenches, could not walk straight when he came 3
out of the English building. It was a butcher shop and kitchen — he had expected 3
that — but it was too much to see familiar English implements in such a place, 3
and to read familiar English graffiti there, some as recent as 1610. I could not go 3
in that building — that building whose daemon activities were stopped only by 3
the dagger of my ancestor Walter de la Poer. 3
3
What I did venture to enter was the low Saxon building whose oaken door had 3
fallen, and there I found a terrible row of ten stone cells with rusty bars. Three 3
had tenants, all skeletons of high grade, and on the bony forefinger of one I 3
found a seal ring with my own coat-of-arms. Sir William found a vault with far 3
older cells below the Roman chapel, but these cells were empty. Below them was 3
a low crypt with cases of formally arranged bones, some of them bearing terrible 3
parallel inscriptions carved in Latin, Greek, and the tongue of Phyrgia. 3
3
Meanwhile, Dr Trask had opened one of the prehistoric tumuli, and brought to 3
light skulls which were slightly more human than a gorilla's, and which bore 3
indescribably ideographic carvings. Through all this horror my cat stalked 3
unperturbed. Once I saw him monstrously perched atop a mountain of bones, 3
and wondered at the secrets that might lie behind his yellow eyes. 3
3
Having grasped to some slight degree the frightful revelations of this twilit area 3
— an area so hideously foreshadowed by my recurrent dream — we turned to 3
that apparently boundless depth of midnight cavern where no ray of light from 3
the cliff could penetrate. We shall never know what sightless Stygian worlds 3
yawn beyond the little distance we went, for it was decided that such secrets are 3
not good for mankind. But there was plenty to engross us close at hand, for we 3
had not gone far before the searchlights showed that accursed infinity of pits in 3
3
3
3
690 3
3
3
3
which the rats had feasted, and whose sudden lack of replenishment had driven 3
the ravenous rodent army first to turn on the living herds of starving things, and 3
then to burst forth from the priory in that historic orgy of devastation which the 3
peasants will never forget. 3
3
God! those carrion black pits of sawed, picked bones and opened skulls! Those 3
nightmare chasms choked with the pithecanthropoid, Celtic, Roman, and English 3
bones of countless unhallowed centuries! Some of them were full, and none can 3
say how deep they had once been. Others were still bottomless to our 3
searchlights, and peopled by unnamable fancies. What, I thought, of the hapless 3
rats that stumbled into such traps amidst the blackness of their quests in this 3
grisly Tartarus? 3
3
Once my foot slipped near a horribly yawning brink, and I had a moment of 3
ecstatic fear. I must have been musing a long time, for I could not see any of the 3
party but plump Capt. Norrys. Then there came a sound from that inky, 3
boundless, farther distance that I thought I knew; and I saw my old black cat dart 3
past me like a winged Egyptian god, straight into the illimitable gulf of the 3
unknown. But I was not far behind, for there was no doubt after another second. 3
It was the eldritch scurrying of those fiend-born rats, always questing for new 3
horrors, and determined to lead me on even unto those grinning caverns of 3
earth's centre where Nyarlathotep, the mad faceless god, howls blindly in the 3
darkness to the piping of two amorphous idiot flute-players. 3
3
My searchlight expired, but still I ran. I heard voices, and yowls, and echoes, but 3
above all there gently rose that impious, insidious scurrying; gently rising, rising, 3
as a stiff bloated corpse gently rises above an oily river that flows under the 3
endless onyx bridges to a black, putrid sea. 3
3
Something bumped into me — something soft and plump. It must have been the 3
rats; the viscous, gelatinous, ravenous army that feast on the dead and the living 3
. . . Why shouldn't rats eat a de la Poer as a de la Poer eats forbidden things? . . . 3
The war ate my boy, damn them all ... and the Yanks ate Carfax with flames and 3
burnt Grandsire Delapore and the secret ... No, no, I tell you, I am not that 3
daemon swineherd in the twilit grotto! It was not Edward Norrys' fat face on 3
that flabby fungous thing! Who says I am a de la Poer? He lived, but my boy 3
died! . . . Shall a Norrys hold the land of a de la Poer? . . . It's voodoo, I tell you . . . 3
that spotted snake ... Curse you, Thornton, I'll teach you to faint at what my 3
family do! ... 'Sblood, thou stinkard, I'll learn ye how to gust ... wolde ye 3
swynke me thilke wys?... Magna Mater! Magna Mater!... Atys... Dia ad 3
aghaidh's ad aodaun... agus bas dunarch ort! Dhonas 's dholas ort, agus leat- 3
sa! . . . Ungl unl. . . rrlh . . . chchch. . . 3
3
3
3
691 3
3
3
3
This is what they say I said when they found me in the blackness after three 3
hours; found me crouching in the blackness over the plump, half-eaten body of 3
Capt. Norrys, with my own cat leaping and tearing at my throat. Now they have 3
blown up Exham Priory, taken my Nigger-Man away from me, and shut me into 3
this barred room at Hanwell with fearful whispers about my heredity and 3
experience. Thornton is in the next room, but they prevent me from talking to 3
him. They are trying, too, to suppress most of the facts concerning the priory. 3
When I speak of poor Norrys they accuse me of this hideous thing, but they must 3
know that I did not do it. They must know it was the rats; the slithering 3
scurrying rats whose scampering will never let me sleep; the daemon rats that 3
race behind the padding in this room and beckon me down to greater horrors 3
than I have ever known; the rats they can never hear; the rats, the rats in the 3
walls. 3

3
I 3
3
After twenty-two years of nightmare and terror, saved only by a desperate 3
conviction of the mythical source of certain impressions, I am unwilling to vouch 3
for the truth of that which I think I found in Western Australia on the night of 17- 3
18 July 1935. There is reason to hope that my experience was wholly or partly an 3
hallucination - for which, indeed, abundant causes existed. And yet, its realism 3
was so hideous that I sometimes find hope impossible. 3
3
If the thing did happen, then man must be prepared to accept notions of the 3
cosmos, and of his own place in the seething vortex of time, whose merest 3
mention is paralysing. He must, too, be placed on guard against a specific, 3
lurking peril which, though it will never engulf the whole race, may impose 3
monstrous and unguessable horrors upon certain venturesome members of it. 3
3
It is for this latter reason that I urge, with all the force of my being, final 3
abandonment of all the attempts at unearthing those fragments of unknown, 3
primordial masonry which my expedition set out to investigate. 3
3
Assuming that I was sane and awake, my experience on that night was such as 3
has befallen no man before. It was, moreover, a frightful confirmation of all I had 3
sought to dismiss as myth and dream. Mercifull there is no proof, for in my 3
fright I lost the awesome object which would - if real and brought out of that 3
noxious abyss - have formed irrefutable evidence. 3
3
When I came upon the horror I was alone - and I have up to now told no one 3
about it. I could not stop the others from digging in its direction, but chance and 3
the shifting sand have so far saved them from finding it. Now I must formulate 3
some definite statement - not only for the sake of my own mental balance, but to 3
warn such others as may read it seriously. 3
3
These pages - much in whose earlier parts will be familiar to close readers of the 3
general and scientific press - are written in the cabin of the ship that is bringing 3
me home. I shall give them to my son. Professor Wingate Peaslee of Miskatonic 3
University - the only member of my family who stuck to me after my queer 3
amnesia of long ago, and the man best informed on the inner facts of my case. Of 3
3
3
3
693 3
3
3
3
all living persons, he is least likely to ridicule what I shall tell of that fateful 3
night. 3
3
I did not enlighten him orally before sailing, because I think he had better have 3
the revelation in written form. Reading and re-reading at leisure will leave with 3
him a more convincing picture than my confused tongue could hope to convey. 3
3
He can do anything that he thinks best with this account - showing it, with 3
suitable comment, in any quarters where it will be likely to accomplish good. It is 3
for the sake of such readers as are unfamiliar with the earlier phases of my case 3
that I am prefacing the revelation itself with a fairly ample summary of its 3
background. 3
3
My name is Nathaniel Wingate Peaslee, and those who recall the newspaper tales 3
of a generation back - or the letters and articles in psychological journals six or 3
seven years ago - will know who and what I am. The press was filled with the 3
details of my strange amnesia in 1908-13, and much was made of the traditions of 3
horror, madness, and witchcraft which lurked behind the ancient Massachusetts 3
town then and now forming my place of residence. Yet I would have it known 3
that there is nothing whatever of the mad or sinister in my heredity and early 3
life. This is a highly important fact in view of the shadow which fell so suddenly 3
upon me from outside sources. 3
3
It may be that centuries of dark brooding had given to crumbling, whisper- 3
haunted Arkham a peculiar vulnerability as regards such shadows - though even 3
this seems doubtful in the light of those other cases which I later came to study. 3
But the chief point is that my own ancestry and background are altogether 3
normal. What came, came from somewhere else - where I even now hesitate to 3
assert in plain words. 3
3
I am the son of Jonathan and Hannah (Wingate) Peaslee, both of wholesome old 3
Haverhill stock. I was born and reared in Haverhill - at the old homestead in 3
Boardman Street near Golden Hill - and did not go to Arkham till I entered 3
Miskatonic University as instructor of political economy in 1895. 3
3
For thirteen years more my life ran smoothly and happily. I married Alice Keezar 3
of Haverhill in 1896, and my three children, Robert, Wingate and Hannah were 3
born in 1898, 1900, and 1903, respectively. In 1898 I became an associate 3
professor, and in 1902 a full professor. At no time had I the least interest in either 3
occultism or abnormal psychology. 3
3
It was on Thursday, 14 May 1908, that the queer amnesia came. The thing was 3
quite sudden, though later I realized that certain brief, glimmering visions of 3
3
3
3
694 3
3
3
3
several, hours previous - chaotic visions which disturbed me greatly because 3
they were so unprecedented - must have formed premonitory symptoms. My 3
head was aching, and I had a singular feeling - altogether new to me - that some 3
one else was trying to get possession of my thoughts. 3
3
The collapse occurred about 10.20 A.M., while I was conducting a class in 3
Political Economy VI - history and present tendencies of economics - for juniors 3
and a few sophomores. I began to see strange shapes before my eyes, and to feel 3
that I was in a grotesque room other than the classroom. 3
3
My thoughts and speech wandered from my subject, and the students saw that 3
something was gravely amiss. Then I slumped down, unconscious, in my chair, 3
in a stupor from which no one could arouse me. Nor did my rightful faculties 3
again look out upon the daylight of our normal world for five years, four 3
months, and thirteen days. 3
3
It is, of course, from others that I have learned what followed. I showed no sign 3
of consciousness for sixteen and a half hours though removed to my home at 27 3
Crane Street, and given the best of medical attention. 3
3
At 3 A.M. May my eyes opened and began to speak and my family were 3
thoroughly frightened by the trend of my expression and language. It was clear 3
that I had no remembrance of my identity and my past, though for some reason 3
seemed anxious to conceal his lack of knowledge. My eyes glazed strangely at 3
the persons around me, and the flections of my facial muscles were altogether 3
unfamiliar. 3
3
Even my speech seemed awkward and foreign. I used my vocal organs clumsily 3
and gropingly, and my diction had a curiously stilted quality, as if I had 3
laboriously learned the English language from books. The pronunciation was 3
barbarously alien, whilst the idiom seemed to include both scraps of curious 3
archaism and expressions of a wholly incomprehensible cast. 3
3
Of the latter, one in particular was very potently - even terrifiedly - recalled by 3
the youngest of the physicians twenty years afterward. For at that late period 3
such a phrase began to have an actual currency - first in England and then in the 3
United States - and though of much complexity and indisputable newness, it 3
reproduced in every least particular the mystifying words of the strange Arkham 3
patient of 1908. 3
3
Physical strength returned at once, although I required an odd amount of re- 3
education in the use of my hands, legs, and bodily apparatus in general. Because 3
3
3
3
695 3
3
3
3
of this and other handicaps inherent in the mnemonic lapse, I was for some time 3
kept under strict medical care. 3
3
When I saw that my attempts to conceal the lapse had failed, I admitted it 3
openly, and became eager for information of all sorts. Indeed, it seemed to the 3
doctors that I lost interest in my proper personality as soon as I found the case of 3
amnesia accepted as a natural thing. 3
3
They noticed that my chief efforts were to master certain points in history, 3
science, art, language, and folklore - some of them tremendously abstruse, and 3
some childishly simple - which remained, very oddly in many cases, outside my 3
consciousness. 3
3
At the same time they noticed that I had an inexplicable command of many 3
almost unknown sorts of knowledge - a command which I seemed to wish to 3
hide rather than display. I would inadvertently refer, with casual assurance, to 3
specific events in dim ages outside of the range of accepted history - passing off 3
such references as a jest when I saw the surprise they created. And I had a way of 3
speaking of the future which two or three times caused actual fright. 3
3
These uncanny flashes soon ceased to appear, though some observers laid their 3
vanishment more to a certain furtive caution on my part than to any waning of 3
the strange knowledge behind them. Indeed, I seemed anomalously avid to 3
absorb the speech, customs, and perspectives of the age around me; as if I were a 3
studious traveller from a far, foreign land. 3
3
As soon as permitted, I haunted the college library at all hours; and shortly 3
began to arrange for those odd travels, and special courses at American and 3
European Universities, which evoked so much comment during the next few 3
years. 3
3
I did not at any time suffer from a lack of learned contacts, for my case had a 3
mild celebrity among the psychologists of the period. I was lectured upon as a 3
typical example of secondary personality - even though I seemed to puzzle the 3
lecturers now and then with some bizarre symptoms or some queer trace of 3
carefully veiled mockery. 3
3
Of real friendliness, however, I encountered little. Something in my aspect and 3
speech seemed to excite vague fears and aversions in every one I met, as if I were 3
a being infinitely removed from all that is normal and healthful. This idea of a 3
black, hidden horror connected with incalculable gulfs of some sort of distance 3
was oddly widespread and persistent. 3
3
3
3
696 3
3
3
3
My own family formed no exception. From the moment of my strange waking 3
my wife had regarded me with extreme horror and loathing, vowing that I was 3
some utter alien usurping the body of her husband. In 1910 she obtained a legal 3
divorce, nor would she ever consent to see me even after my return to normality 3
in 1913. These feelings were shared by my elder son and my small daughter, 3
neither of whom I have ever seen since. 3
3
Only my second son, Wingate, seemed able to conquer the terror and repulsion 3
which my change aroused. He indeed felt that I was a stranger, but though only 3
eight years old held fast to a faith that my proper self would return. When it did 3
return he sought me out, and the courts gave me his custody. In succeeding years 3
he helped me with the studies to which I was driven, and today, at thirty-five, he 3
is a professor of psychology at Miskatonic. 3
3
But I do not wonder at the horror caused - for certainly, the mind, voice, and 3
facial expression of the being that awakened on 15 May 1908, were not those of 3
Nathaniel Wingate Peastee. 3
3
I will not attempt to tell much of my life from 1908 to 1913, since readers may 3
glean I the outward essentials - as I largely had to do - from files of old 3
newspapers and scientific journals. 3
3
I was given charge of my funds, and spent them slowly and on the whole wisely, 3
in travel and in study at various centres of learning. My travels, however, were 3
singular in the extreme, involving long visits to remote and desolate places. 3
3
In 1909 I spent a month in the Himalayas, and in 1911 roused much attention 3
through a camel trip into the unknown deserts of Arabia. What happened on 3
those journeys I have never been able to learn. 3
3
During the summer of 1912 I chartered a ship and sailed in the Arctic, north of 3
Spitzbergen, afterward showing signs of disappointment. 3
3
Later in that year I spent weeks - alone beyond the limits of previous or 3
subsequent exploration in the vast limestone cavern systems of western Virginia 3
- black labyrinths so complex that no retracing of my steps could even be 3
considered. 3
3
My sojourns at the universities were marked by abnormally rapid assimilation, 3
as if the secondary personality had an intelligence enormously superior to my 3
own. I have found, also, that my rate of reading and solitary study was 3
phenomenal. I could master every detail of a book merely by glancing over it as 3
3
3
3
697 3
3
3
3
fast as I could turn the leaves; while my skill at interpreting complex figures in 3
an instant was veritably awesome. 3
3
At times there appeared almost ugly reports of my power to influence the 3
thoughts and acts of others, though I seemed to have taken care to minimize 3
displays of this faculty. 3
3
Other ugly reports concerned my intimacy with leaders of occultist groups, and 3
scholars suspected of connection with nameless bands of abhorrent elder-world 3
hierophants. These rumours, though never proved at the time, were doubtless 3
stimulated by the known tenor of some of my reading - for the consuUtation of 3
rare books at libraries cannot be effected secretly. 3
3
There is tangible proof - in the form of marginal notes - that I went minutely 3
through such things as the Comte d'Erlette's Cultes des Goules, Ludvig Prinn's 3
De Vermis Mysteriis, the Unaussprechlichen Kulten of von Junzt, the surviving 3
fragments of the puzzling Book of Eibon, and the dreaded Necronomicon of the 3
mad Arab Abdul Alhazred. Then, too, it is undeniable that a fresh and evil wave 3
of underground cult activity set in about the time of my odd mutation. 3
3
In the summer of 1913 I began to display signs of ennui and flagging interest, 3
and to hint to various associates that a change might soon be expected in me. I 3
spoke of returning memories of my earlier life - though most auditors judged me 3
insincere, since all the recollections I gave were casual, and such as might have 3
been learned from my old private papers. 3
3
About the middle of August I returned to Arkham and re-opened my long- 3
closed house in Crane Street. Here I installed a mechanism of the most curious 3
aspect, constructed piecemeal by different makers of scientific apparatus in 3
Europe and America, and guarded carefully from the sight of any one intelligent 3
enough to analyse it. 3
3
Those who did see it - a workman, a servant, and the new housekeeper - say that 3
it was a queer mixture of rods, wheels, and mirros, though only about two feet 3
tall, one foot wide, and one foot thick. The central mirror was circular and 3
convex. All this is borne out by such makers of parts as can be located. 3
3
On the evening of Friday, 26 September, I dismissed the housekeeper and the 3
maid until noon of the next day. Lights burned in the house till late, and a lean, 3
dark, curiously foreign-looking man called in an automobile. 3
3
3
3
698 3
3
3
3
It was about one A.M. that the hghts were last seen. At 2.15 A.M. a poHceman 3
observed the place in darkness, but the strager's motor still at the curb. By 4 3
o'clock the motor was certainly gone. 3
3
It was at 6 o'clock that a hesitant, foreign voice on the telephone asked Dr Wilson 3
to call at my house and bring me out of a peculiar faint. This call - a long-distance 3
one - was later traced to a public booth in the North Station in Boston, but no 3
sign of the lean foreigner was ever unearthed. 3
3
When the doctor reached my house he found me unconscious in the sitting room 3
3
- in an easy-chair with a table drawn up before it. On the polished top were 3
scratches showing where some heavy object had rested. The queer machine was 3
gone, nor was anything afterward heard of it. Undoubtedly the dark, lean 3
foreigner had taken it away. 3
3
In the library grate were abundant ashes, evidently left from the burning of the 3
every remainmg scrap of paper on which I had written since the advent of the 3
amnesia. Dr Wilson found my breathing very peculiar, but after a hypodermic 3
injection it became more regular. 3
3
At 11.15 A.M., 27 September, I stirred vigorously, and my hitherto masklike face 3
began to show signs of expression. Dr Wilson remarked that the expression was 3
not that of my secondary personality, but seemed much like that of my normal 3
self. About 11.30 I muttered some very curious syllables - syllables which seemed 3
unrelated to any human speech. I appeared, too, to struggle against something. 3
Then, just afternoon - the housekeeper and the maid having meanwhile returned 3
3
- I began to mutter in English. 3
3
"- of the orthodox economists of that period, Jevons typifies the prevailing trend 3
toward scientific correlation. His attempt to link the commercial cycle of 3
prosperity and depression with the physical cycle of the solar spots forms 3
perhaps the apex of -" 3
3
Nathaniel Wingate Peaslee had come back - a spirit in whose time scale it was 3
still Thursday morning in 1908, with the economics class gazing up at the 3
battered desk on the platform. 3
3
II 3
3
My reabsorption into normal life was a painful and difficult process. The loss of 3
over five years creates more complications than can be imagined, and in my case 3
there were countless matters to be adjusted. 3
3
3
3
699 3
3
3
3
What I heard of my actions since 1908 astonished and disturbed me, but I tried to 3
view the matter as philosophically as I could. At last, regaining custody of my 3
second son, Wingate, I settled down with him in the Crane Street house and 3
endeavoured to resume my teaching - my old professorship having been kindly 3
offered me by the college. 3
3
I began work with the February, 1914, term, and kept at it just a year. By that 3
time I realized how badly my experience had shaken me. Though perfectly sane - 3
I hoped - and with no flaw in my original personality, I had not the nervous 3
energy of the old days. Vague dreams and queer ideas continually haunted me, 3
and when the outbreak of the World War turned my mind to history I found 3
myself thinking of periods and events in the oddest possible fashion. 3
3
My conception of time, my ability to distinguish between consecutiveness and 3
simultaneousness - seemed subtly disordered so that I formed chimerical notions 3
about living in one age and casting one's mind all over etenity for knowledge of 3
past and future ages. 3
3
The war gave me strange impressions of remembering some of its far-off 3
consequences - as if I knew how it was coming out and could look back upon it 3
in the light of future information. All such quasi-memories were attended with 3
much pain, and with a feeling that some artificial psychological barrier was set a 3
against them. 3
3
When I diffidently hinted to others about my impressions I met with varied 3
responses. Some persons looked uncomfortably at me, but men in the 3
mathematics department spoke of new developments in those theories of 3
relativity - then discussed only in learned circles - which were later to become so 3
famous. Dr. Albert Einstein, they said, was rapidly reducing time to the status of 3
a mere dimension. 3
3
But the dreams and disturbed feelings gained on me, so that I had to drop my 3
regular work in 1915. Certainly the impressions were taking an annoying shape - 3
giving me the persistent notion that my amnesia had formed some unholy sort of 3
exchange; that the secondary personality had indeed had had suffered 3
displacement, been an in- 3
3
Thus I was driven to vague and fright speculations concerning the whereabouts 3
of my true self during the years that another had held my body. The curious 3
knowledge and strange conduct of my body's late tenant troubled me more and 3
more as I learned further details from persons, papers, and magazines. 3
3
3
3
700 3
3
3
3
Queernesses that had baffled others seemed to harmonize terribly with some 3
background of black knowledge which festered in the chasms of my 3
subconscious. I began to search feverishly for every scrap of information bearing 3
on the studies and travels of that other one during the dark years. 3
3
Not all of my troubles were as semi-abstract as this. There were the dreams - and 3
these seemed to grow in vividness and concreteness. Knowing how most would 3
regard them, I seldom mentioned them to anyone but my son or certain trusted 3
psychologists, but eventually I commenced a scientific study of other cases in 3
order to see how typical or nontypical such visions might be among amnesia 3
victims. 3
3
My results, aided by psychologists, historians, anthropologists, and mental 3
specialists of wide experience, and by a study that included all records of split 3
personalities from the days of daemonic-possession legends to the medically 3
realistic present, at first bothered me more than they consoled me. 3
3
I soon found that my dreams had, indeed, no counterpart in the overwhelming 3
bulk of true amnesia cases. There remained, however, a tiny residue of accounts 3
which for years baffled and shocked me with their parallelism to my own 3
experience. Some of them were bits of ancient folklore; others were case histories 3
in the annals of medicine; one or two were anecdotes obscurely buried in 3
standard histories. 3
3
It thus appeared that, while my special kind of affliction was prodigiously rare, 3
instances of it had occurred at long intervals ever since the beginnig of men's 3
annals. Some centuries might contain one, two, or three cases, others none - or at 3
least none whose record survived. 3
3
The essence was always the same - a person of keen thoughtfulness seized a 3
strange secondary life and leading for a greater or lesser period an utterly alien 3
existence typified at first by vocal and bodily awkwardness, an later by a 3
wholesale acquisition of scientific, historic, artistic, and anthropologic 3
knowledge; an acquisition carried on with feverish zest and with a wholly 3
abnormal absorptive power. Then a sudden return of rightful consciousness, 3
intermittently plagued ever after with vague unplaceable dreams suggesting 3
fragments of some hideous memory elaborately blotted out. 3
3
And the close resemblance of those nightmares to my own - even in some of the 3
smallest particulars - left no doubt in my mind of their significantly typical 3
nature. One or two of the cases had an added ring of faint, blasphemous 3
familiarity, as if I had heard of them before through some cosmic channel too 3
morbid and frightful to contemplate. In three instances there was specific 3
3
3
3
701 3
3
3
3
mention of such an unknown machine as had been in my house before the 3
second change. 3
3
Another thing that worried me during my investigation was the somewhat 3
greater frequency of cases where a brief, elusive gHmpse of the typical 3
nightmares was afforded to persons not visited well-defined amnesia. 3
3
These persons were largely of mediocre mind or less - some so primitive that 3
they could scarcely be thought of as vehicles forabnormal scholarship and 3
preternatural mental acquisitions. For a second they would be fired with alien 3
force - then a backward lapse, and a thin, swift-fading memory of unhuman 3
horrors. 3
3
There had been at least three such cases during the past half century - one only 3
fifteen years before. Had something been groping blindly through time from 3
some unsuspected abyss in Nature? Were these faint cases monstrous, sinister 3
experiments of a kind and authorship uttely beyond same belief? 3
3
Such were a few of the forless speculations of my weaker hours - fancies abetted 3
by myths which my studies uncovered. For I could not doubt but that certain 3
persistent legends of immemorial antiquity, apparently unknown to the victims 3
and physicians connected with recent amnesia cases, formed a striking and 3
awesome elaboration of memory lapses such as mine. 3
3
Of the nature of the dreams and impressions which were growing so clamorous I 3
still almost fear to speak. They seemed to savor of madness, and at times I 3
believed I was indeed going mad. Was there a special type of delusion afflicting 3
those who had suffered lapses of memory? Conceivably, the efforts of the 3
subconscious mind to fill up a perplexing blank with pseudo-memories might 3
give rise to strange imaginative vagaries. 3
3
This indeed - though an alternative folklore theory finally seemed to me more 3
plausible - was the belief of many of the alienists who helped me in my search for 3
parallel cases, and who shared my puzzlement at the exact resemblances 3
sometimes discovered. 3
3
They did not call the condition true insanity, but classed it rather among neurotic 3
disorders. My course in trying to track down and analyze it, instead of vaintly 3
seeking to dismiss or forget it, they heartily endorsed as correct according to the 3
best psychological principles. I especially valued the advice of such physicians as 3
had studied me during my possession by the other personality. 3
3
3
3
702 3
3
3
3
My first disturbances were not visual at all, but concerned the more abstract 3
matters which I have mentioned. There was, too, a feeling of profound and 3
inexplicable horror concerning myself. I developed a queer fear of seeing my 3
own form, as if my eyes would find it something utterly alien and inconceivably 3
abhorrent. 3
3
When I did glance down and behold the familiar human shape in quiet grey or 3
blue clothing, I always felt a curious relief, though in order to gain this relief I 3
had to conquer an infinite dread. I shunned mirrors as much as possible, and was 3
always shaved at the barber's. 3
3
It was a long time before I correlated any of these disappointed feelings with the 3
fleeting, visual impressions which began to develop. The first such correlation 3
had to do with the odd sensation of an external, artificial restraint on my 3
memory. 3
3
I felt that the snatches of sight I experienced had a profound and terrible 3
meaning, and a frightful connexion with myself, but that some purposeful 3
influence held me from grasping that meaning and that connexion. Then came 3
that queerness about the element of time, and with it desperate efforts to place 3
the fragmentary dream-glimpses in the chronological and spatial pattern. 3
3
The glimpses themselves were at first merely strange rather than horrible. I 3
would seem to be in an enormous vaulted chamber whose lofty stone aroinings 3
were well-nigh lost in the shadows overhead. In whatever time or place the scene 3
might be, the principle of the arch was known as fully and used as extensively as 3
by the Romans. 3
3
There were colossal, round windows and high, arched doors, and pedestals or 3
tables each as tall as the height of an ordinary room. Vast shelves of dark wood 3
lined the walls, holding what seemed to be volumes of immense size with 3
strange hieroglyphs on their backs. 3
3
The exposed stonework held curious carvings, always in curvilinear 3
mathematical designs, and there were chiselled inscriptions in the same 3
characters that the huge books bore. The dark granite masonry was of a 3
monstrous megathic type, with lines of convex-topped blocks fitting the concave- 3
bottomed courses which rested upon them. 3
3
There were no chairs, but the tops of the vast pedestals were littered with books, 3
papers, and what seemed to be writing materials - oddly figured jars of a 3
purplish metal, and rods with stained tips. Tall as the pedestals were, I seemed at 3
times able to view them from above. On some of them were great globes of 3
3
3
3
703 3
3
3
3
luminous crystal serving as lamps, and inexplicable machines formed of vitreous 3
tubes and metal rods. 3
3
The windows were glazed, and latticed with stout-looking bars. Though I dared 3
not approach and peer out them, I could see from where I was he waving tops of 3
singular fern-like growths. The floor was of massive octagonal flagstones, while 3
rugs and hangings were entirely lacking. 3
3
Later I had visions of sweeping through Cyclopean corridors of stone, and up 3
and down gigantic inclined planes of the same monstrous masonry. There were 3
no stairs anywhere, nor was any passageway less than thirty feet wide. Some of 3
the structures through which I floated must have towered in the sky for 3
thousands of feet. 3
3
There were multiple levels of black vaults below, and never-opened trapdoors, 3
sealed down with metal bands and holding dim suggestions of some special 3
peril. 3
3
I seemed to be a prisoner, and horror hung broodingly over everything I saw. I 3
felt that the mocking curvilinear hieroglyphs on the walls would blast my soul 3
with their message were I not guarded by a merciful ignorance. 3
3
Still later my dreams included vistas from the great round windows, and from 3
the titanic flat roof, with its curious gardens, wide barren area, and high, 3
scalloped parapet of stone, to which the topmost of the inclined planes led. 3
3
There were, almost endless leagues of giant buildings, each in its garden, and 3
ranged along paved roads fully 200 feet wide. They differed greatly in aspect, but 3
few were less than 500 feet square or a thousand feet high. Many seemed so 3
limitless that they must have had a frontage of several thousand feet, while some 3
shot up to mountainous altitudes in the grey, steamy heavens. 3
3
They seemed to be mainly of stone or concrete, and most of them embodied the 3
oddly curvilinear type of masonry noticeable in the building that held me. Roofs 3
were flat and garden-covered, and tended to have scalloped parapets. Sometimes 3
there were terraces and higher levels, and wide, cleared spaces amidst the 3
gardens. The great roads held hints of motion, but in the earlier visions I could 3
not resolve this impression into details. 3
3
In certain places I beheld enormous dark cylindrical towers which climbed far 3
above any of the other structures. These appeared to be of a totally unique nature 3
and shewed signs of prodigious age and dilapidation. They were built of a 3
bizarre type of square-cut basalt masonry, and tapered slightly toward their 3
3
3
3
704 3
3
3
3
rounded tops. Nowhere in any of them could the least traces of windows or 3
other apertures save huge doors be found. I noticed also some lower buildinigs - 3
all crumbling with the weathering of aeons - which resembled these dark, 3
cylindrical towers in basic architecture. Around all these aberrant piles of square- 3
cut masonry there hovered an inexplicable aura of menace and concentrated fear, 3
like that bred by the sealed trap-doors. 3
3
The omnipresent gardens were almost terrifying in their strangeness, with 3
bizarre and unfamiliar forms of vegetation nodding over broad paths lined with 3
curiously carven monoliths. Abnormally vast fern-like growths predominated - 3
some green, and some of a ghastly, fungoid pallor. 3
3
Among them rose great spectral things resembling calamites, whose bamboo-like 3
trunks towered to fabulous heights. Then there were tufted forms like fabulous 3
cycads, and grotesque dark-green shrubs and trees of coniferous aspect. 3
3
Flowers were small, colourless, and unrecognizable, blooming in geometrical 3
beds and at large among the greenery. 3
3
In a few of the terrace and roof-top gardens were larger and more blossoms of 3
most offensive contours and seeming to suggest artificial breeding. Fungi of 3
inconceivable size, outlines, and colours speckled the scene in patterns 3
bespeaking some unknown but well-established horticultural tradition. In the 3
larger gardens on the ground there seemed to be some attempt to preserve the 3
irregularities of Nature, but on the roofs there was more selectiveness, and more 3
evidences of the topiary art. 3
3
The sides were almost always moist and cloudy, and sometimes I would seem to 3
witness tremendous rains. Once in a while, though, there would be glimpses of 3
the sun - which looked abnormally large - and of the moon, whose markings 3
held a touch of difference from the normal that I could never quite fathom. When 3
- very rarely - the night sky was clear to any extent, I beheld constellations which 3
were nearly beyond recognition. Known outlines were sometimes approximated, 3
but seldom duplicated; and from the position of the few groups I could 3
recognize, I felt I must be in the earth's southern hemisphere, near the Tropic of 3
Capricorn. 3
3
The far horizon was always steamy and indistinct, but I could see that great 3
jungles of unknown tree-ferns, calamites, lepidodendra, and sigillaria lay outside 3
the city, their fantastic frondage waving mockingly in the shifting vapours. Now 3
and then there would be suggestions of motion in the sky, but these my early 3
visions never resolved. 3
3
3
3
705 3
3
3
3
By the autumn of 1914 I began to have infrequent dreams of strange floatings 3
over the city and through the regions around it. I saw interminable roads 3
through forests of fearsome growths with mottled, fluted, and banded trunks, 3
and past other cities as strange as the one which persistently haunted me. 3
3
I saw monstrous constructions of black or iridescent tone in glades and clearings 3
where perpetual twilight reigned, and traversed long causeways over swamps so 3
dark that I could tell but little of their moist, towering vegetation. 3
3
Once I saw an area of countless miles strewn with age-blasted basaltic ruins 3
whose architecture had been like that of the few windowless, round-topped 3
towers in the haunting city. 3
3
And once I saw the sea - a boundless, steamy expanse beyond the colossal stone 3
piers of an enormous town of domes and arches. Great shapeless sugggestions of 3
shadow moved over it, and here and there its surface was vexed ith anomalous 3
spoutings. 3
3
Ill 3
3
As I have said, it was not immediately that these wild visions began to hold their 3
terrifying quality. Certainly, many persons have dreamed intrinsically stranger 3
things - things compounded of unrelated scraps of daily life, pictures,and 3
reading, and arranged in fantastically novel forms by the unchecked caprices of 3
sleep. 3
3
For some time I accepted the visions as natural, even though I had never before 3
been an extravagant dreamer. Many of the vague anomalies, I argued, must have 3
come from trivial sources too numerous to track down; while others seemed to 3
reflect a common text book knowledge of the plants and other conditions of the 3
primitive world of a hundred and fifty million years ago - the world of the 3
Permian or Triassic age. 3
3
In the course of some months, however, the element of terror did figure with 3
accumulating force. This was when the dreams began so unfailingly to have the 3
aspect of memories, and when my mind began to link them with my growing 3
abstract disturbances - the feeling of mnemonic restraint, the curious impressions 3
regarding time, and sense of a loathsome exchange with my secondary 3
personality of 1908-13, and, considerably later, the inexplicable loathing of my 3
own person. 3
3
As certain definite details began to enter the dreams, their horror increased a 3
thousandfold - until by October, 1915, 1 felt I must do something. It was then that 3
3
3
3
706 3
3
3
3
I began an intensive study of other cases of amnesia and visions, feeling that I 3
might thereby obectivise my trouble and shake clear of its emotional grip. 3
3
However, as before mentioned, the result was at first almost exactly opposite. It 3
disturbed me vastly to find that my dreams had been so closely duplicated; 3
especially since some of the accounts were too early to admit of any geological 3
knowledge - and therefore of any idea of primitive landscapes - on the subjects' 3
part. 3
3
What is more, many of these accounts supplied very horrible details and 3
explanations in connexion with the visions of great buildings and jungle gardens 3
- and other things. The actual sights and vague impressions were bad enough, 3
but what was hinted or asserted by some of the other dreamers savored of 3
madness and blasphemy. Worst of all, my own pseudo-memory was aroused to 3
milder dreams and hints of coming revelations. And yet most doctors deemed 3
my course, on he whole, an advisable one. 3
3
I studied psychology systematically, and under the prevailing stimulus my son 3
Wingate did the same - his studies leading eventually to his present 3
professorship. In 1917 and 1918 I took special courses at Miskatonic. Meanwhile, 3
my examination of medical, historical, and anthropological records became 3
indefatigable, involving travels to distant libraries, and finally including even a 3
reading of the hideous books of forbidden elder lore in which my secondary 3
personality had been so disturbingly interested. 3
3
Some of the latter were the actual copies I had consulted in my altered state, and 3
I was greatly disturbed by certain marginal notations and ostensible corrections 3
of the hideous text in a script and idiom which somehow seemed oddly 3
unhuman. 3
3
These markings were mostly in the respective languages of the various books, all 3
of which the writer seemed to know with equal, though obviously academic, 3
facility. One note appended to von Junzt's Unaussprechlichen Kulten, however, 3
was alarmingly otherwise. It consisted of certain curvilinear hieroglyphs in the 3
same ink as that of the German corrections, but following no recognized human 3
pattern. And these hieroglyphs were closely and unmistakably aldn to the 3
characters constantly met with in my dreams - characters whose meaning I 3
would sometimes momentarily fancy I knew, or was just on the brink of 3
recalling. 3
3
To complete my black confusion, my librarians assured me that, in view of 3
previous examinations and records of consultation of the volumes in question, all 3
of these notations must have been made by myself in my secondary state. This 3
3
3
3
707 3
3
3
3
despite the fact that I was and still am ignorant of three of the languages 3
involved. 3
3
Piecing together the scattered records, ancient and modern, anthropological and 3
medical, I found a fairly consistent mixture of myth and hallucination whose 3
scope and wildness left me utterly dazed. Only one thing consoled me, the fact 3
that the myths were of such early existence. What lost knowledge could have 3
brought pictures of the Palaeozoic or Mesozoic landscape into these primitive 3
fables, I could not even guess; but the pictures had been there. Thus, a basis 3
existed for the formation of a fixed type of delusion. 3
3
Cases of amnesia no doubt created the general myth pattern - but afterward the 3
fanciful accretions of the myths must have reacted on amnesia sufferers and 3
coloured their pseudo-memories. I myself had read and heard all the early tales 3
during my memory lapse - my quest had amply proved that. Was it not natural, 3
then, for my subsequent dreams and emotional impressions to become coloured 3
and moulded by what my memory subtly held over from my secondary state? 3
3
A few of the myths had significant connexions with other cloudy legends of the 3
pre-human world, especially those Hindu tales involving stupefying gulfs of 3
time and forming part of the lore of modern theosopists. 3
3
Primal myth and modern delusion joined in their assumption that mankind is 3
only one - perhaps the least - of the highly evolved and dominant races of this 3
planet's long and largely unknown career. Things of inconceivable shape, they 3
implied, had reared towers to the sky and delved into every secret of Nature 3
before the first amphibian forbear of man had crawled out of the hot sea 300 3
million years ago. 3
3
Some had come down from the stars; a few were as old as the cosmos itself, 3
others had arisen swiftly from terrene germs as far behind the first germs of our 3
life-cycle as those germs are behind ourselves. Spans of thousands of millions of 3
years, and linkages to other galaxies and universes, were freely spoken of. 3
Indeed, there was no such thing as time in its humanly accepted sense. 3
3
But most of the tales and impressions concerned a relatively late race, of a queer 3
and intricate shape, resembling no life-form known to science, which had lived 3
till only fifty million years before the advent of man. This, they indicated, was 3
the greatest race of all because it alone had conquered the secret of time. 3
3
It had learned all things that ever were known or ever would be known on the 3
earth, through the power of its keener minds to project themselves into the past 3
and future, even through gulfs of millions of years, and study the lore of every 3
3
3
3
708 3
3
3
3
age. From the accomplishments of this race arose all legends of prophets, 3
including those in human mythology. 3
3
In its vast libraries were volumes of texts and pictures holding the whole of 3
earth's annals-histories and descriptions of every species that had ever been or 3
that ever would be, with full records of their arts, their achievements, their 3
languages, and their psychologies. 3
3
With this aeon-embracing knowledge, the Great Race chose from every era and 3
life-form such thoughts, arts, and processes as might suit its own nature and 3
situation. Knowledge of the past, secured through a kind of mind-casting outside 3
the recognized senses, was harder to glean than knowledge of the future. 3
3
In the latter case the course was easier and more material. With suitable 3
mechanical aid a mind would project itself forward in time, feeling its dim, extra- 3
sensory way till it approached the desired period. Then, after preliminary trials, 3
it would seize on the best discoverable representative of the highest of that 3
period's life-forms. It would enter the organism's brain and set up therein its 3
own vibrations, while the displaced mind would strike back to the period of the 3
displacer, remaining in the latter's body till a reverse process was set up. 3
3
The projected mind, in the body of the organism of the future, would then pose 3
as a member of the race whose outward form it wore, learning as quickly as 3
possible all that could be learned of the chosen age and its massed information 3
and techniques. 3
3
Meanwhile the displaced mind, thrown back to the displacer's age and body, 3
would be carefully guarded. It would be kept from harming the body it 3
occupied, and would be drained of all its knowledge by trained questioners. 3
Often it could be questioned in its own language, when previous quests into the 3
future had brought back records of that language. 3
3
If the mind came from a body whose language the Great Race could not 3
physically reproduce, clever machines would be made, on which the alien speech 3
could be played as on a musical instrument. 3
3
The Great Race's members were immense rugose cones ten feet high, and with 3
head and other organs attached to foot-thick, distensible limbs spreading from 3
the apexes. They spoke by the clicking or scraping of huge paws or claws 3
attached to the end of two of their four limbs, and walked by the expansion and 3
contraction of a viscous layer attached to their vast, ten-foot bases. 3
3
3
3
709 3
3
3
3
When the captive mind's amazement and resentment had worn off, and when - 3
assuming that it came from a body vastly different from the Great Race's - it had 3
lost its horror at its unfamiliar temporary form, it was permitted to study its new 3
environment and experience a wonder and wisdom approyimating that of its 3
displacer. 3
3
With suitable precautions, and in exchange for suitable services, it was allowed 3
to rove all over the habitable world in titan airships or on the huge boatlike 3
atomic-engined vehicles which traversed the great roads, and to delve freely into 3
the libraries containing the records of the planet's past and future. 3
3
This reconciled many captive minds to their lot; since none were other than keen, 3
and to such minds the unveiling of hidden mysteries of earth-closed chapters of 3
inconceivable pasts and dizzying vortices of future time which include the years 3
ahead of their own natural ages-forms always, despite the abysmal horrors often 3
unveiled, the supreme experience of life. 3
3
Now and then certain captives were permitted to meet other captive minds 3
seized from the future - to exchange thoughts with consciousnesses living a 3
hundred or a thousand or a million years before or after their own ages. And all 3
were urged to write copiously in their own languages of themselves and their 3
respective periods; such documents to be filed in the great central archives. 3
3
It may be added that there was one special type of captive whose privileges were 3
far greater than those of the majority. These were the dying permanent exiles, 3
whose bodies in the future had been seized by keen-minded members of the 3
Great Race who, faced with death, sought to escape mental extinction. 3
3
Such melancholy exiles were not as common as might be expected, since the 3
longevity of the Great Race lessened its love of life - especially among those 3
superior minds capable of projection. From cases of the permanent projection of 3
elder minds arose many of those lasting changes of personality noticed in later 3
history - including mankind's. 3
3
As for the ordinary cases of exploration - when the displacing mind had learned 3
what it wished in the future, it would build an apparatus like that which had 3
started its flight and reverse the process of projection. Once more it would be in 3
its own body in its own age, while the lately captive mind would return to that 3
body of the future to which it properly belonged. 3
3
Only when one or the other of the bodies had died during the exchange was this 3
restoration impossible. In such cases, of course, the exploring mind had - like 3
those of the death-escapers - to live out an alien-bodied life in the future; or else 3
3
3
3
710 3
3
3
3
the captive mind-like the dying permanent exiles - had to end its days in the 3
form and past age of the Great Race. 3
3
This fate was least horrible when the captive mind was also of the Great Race - a 3
not infrequent occurrence, since in all its periods that race was intensely 3
concerned with its own future. The number of dying permanent exiles of the 3
Great Race was very slight - largely because of the tremendous penalties attached 3
to displacements of future Great Race minds by the moribund. 3
3
Through projection, arrangements were made to inflict these penalties on the 3
offending minds in their new future bodies - and sometimes forced reexchanges 3
were effected. 3
3
Complex cases of the displacement of exploring or already captive minds by 3
minds in various regions of the past had been known and carefully rectified. In 3
every age since the discovery of mind projection, a minute but well-recognised 3
element of the population consisted of Great Race minds from past ages, 3
sojourning for a longer or shorter while. 3
3
When a captive mind of alien origin was returned to its own body in the future, 3
it was purged by an intricate mechanical hypnosis of all it had learned in the 3
Great Race's age - this because of certain troublesome consequences inherent in 3
the general carrying forward of knowledge in large quantities. 3
3
The few existing instances of clear transmission had caused, and would cause at 3
known future times, great disasters. And it was largely in consequence of two 3
cases of this kind - said the old myths - that mankind had learned what it had 3
concerning the Great Race. 3
3
Of all things surviving physically and directly from that aeon-distant world, 3
there remained only certain ruins of great stones in far places and under the sea, 3
and parts of the text of the frightful Pnakotic Manuscripts. 3
3
Thus the returning mind reached its own age with only the faintest and most 3
fragmentary visions of what it had undergone since its seizure. All memories 3
that could be eradicated were eradicated, so that in most cases only a dream- 3
shadowed blank stretched back to the time of the first exchange. Some minds 3
recalled more than others, and the chance joining of memories had at rare times 3
brought hints of the forbidden past to future ages. 3
3
There probably never was a time when groups or cults did not secretly cherish 3
certain of these hints. In the Necronomicon the presence of such a cult among 3
3
3
3
711 3
3
3
3
human beings was suggested - a cult that sometimes gave aid to minds voyaging 3
down the aeons from the days of the Great Race. 3
3
And, meanwhile, the Great Race itself waxed well-nigh omniscient, and turned 3
to the task of setting up exchanges with the minds of other planets, and of 3
exploring their pasts and futures. It sought likewise to fathom the past years and 3
origin of that black, aeon-dead orb in far space whence its own mental heritage 3
had come - for the mind of the Great Race was older than its bodily form. 3
3
The beings of a dying elder world, wise with the ultimate secrets, had looked 3
ahead for a new world and species wherein they might have long life; and had 3
sent their minds en masse into that future race best adapted to house them - the 3
cone-shaped beings that peopled our earth a billion years ago. 3
3
Thus the Great Race came to be, while the myriad minds sent backward were left 3
to die in the horror of strange shapes. Later the race would again face death, yet 3
would live through another forward migration of its best minds into the bodies 3
of others who had a longer physical span ahead of them. 3
3
Such was the background of intertwined legend and hallucination. When, 3
around 1920, 1 had my researches in coherent shape, I felt a slight lessening of the 3
tension which their earlier stages had increased. After all, and in spite of the 3
fancies prompted by blind emotions, were not most of my phenomena readily 3
explainable? Any chance might have turned my mind to dark studies during the 3
amnesia - and then I read the forbidden legends and met the members of ancient 3
and ill-regarded cults. That, plainly, supplied the material for the dreams and 3
disturbed feelings which came after the return of memory. 3
3
As for the marginal notes in dream-hieroglyphs and languages unknown to me, 3
but laid at my door by librarians - I might easily have picked up a smattering of 3
the tongues during my secondary state, while the hieroglyphs were doubtless 3
coined by my fancy from descriptions in old legends, and afterward woven into 3
my dreams. I tried to verify certain points through conversation with known cult 3
leaders, but never succeeded in establishing the right connexions. 3
3
At times the parallelism of so many cases in so many distant ages continued to 3
worry me as it had at first, but on the other hand I reflected that the excitant 3
folklore was undoubtedly more universal in the past than in the present. 3
3
Probably all the other victims whose cases were like mine had had a long and 3
familiar knowledge of the tales I had learned only when in my secondary state. 3
When these victims had lost their memory, they had associated themselves with 3
the creatures of their household myths - the fabulous invaders supposed to 3
3
3
3
712 3
3
3
3
displace men's minds - and had thus embarked upon quests for knowledge 3
which they thought they could take back to a fancied, non-human past. 3
3
Then, when their memory returned, they reversed the associative process and 3
thought of themselves as the former captive minds instead of as the displacers. 3
Hence the dreams and pseudo-memories following the conventional myth 3
pattern. 3
3
Despite the seeming cumbrousness of these explanations, they came finally to 3
supersede all others in my mind-largely because of the greater weakness of any 3
rival theory. And a substantial number of eminent psychologists and 3
anthropologists gradually agreed with me. 3
3
The more I reflected, the more convincing did my reasoning seem; till in the end 3
I had a really effective bulwark against the visions and impressions which still 3
assailed me. Suppose I did see strange things at night? These were only what I 3
had heard and read of. Suppose I did have odd loathings and perspectives and 3
pseudo-memories? These, too, were only echoes of myths absorbed in my 3
secondary state. Nothing that I might dream, nothing that I might feel, could be 3
of any actual significance. 3
3
Fortified by this philosophy, I greatly improved in nervous equilibrium, even 3
though the visions - rather than the abstract impressions - steadily became more 3
frequent and more disturbingly detailed. In 1922 I felt able to undertake regular 3
work again, and put my newly gained knowledge to practical use by accepting 3
an instructorship in psychology at the university. 3
3
My old chair of political economy had long been adequately filled - besides 3
which, methods of teaching economics had changed greatly since my heyday. 3
My son was at this time just entering on the post-graduate studies leading to his 3
resent professorship, and we worked together a great deal. 3
3
IV 3
3
I continued, however, to keep a careful record of the outre dreams which 3
crowded upon me so thickly and vividly. Such a record, I argued, was of genuine 3
value as a psychological document. The glimpses still seemed damnably like 3
memories, though I fought off this impression with a goodly measure of success. 3
3
In writing, I treated the phantasmata as things seen; but at all other times I 3
brushed them aside like any gossamer illusions of the night. I had never 3
mentioned such matters in common conversation; though reports of them, 3
filtering out as such things will, had aroused sundry rumors regarding my 3
3
3
3
713 3
3
3
3
mental health. It is amusing to reflect that these rumors were confined wholly to 3
laymen, without a single champion among physicians or psychologists. 3
3
Of my visions after 1914 I will here mention only a few, since fuller accounts and 3
records are at the disposal of the serious student. It is evident that with time the 3
curious inhibitions somewhat waned, for the scope of my visions vastly 3
increased. They have never, though, become other than disjointed fragments 3
seemingly without clear motivation. 3
3
Within the dreams I seemed gradually to acquire a greater and greater freedom 3
of wandering. I floated through many strange buildings of stone, going from one 3
to the other along mammoth underground passages which seemed to form the 3
common avenues of transit. Sometimes I encountered those gigantic sealed trap- 3
doors in the lowest level, around which such an aura of fear and forbiddenness 3
clung. 3
3
I saw tremendously tessellated pools, and rooms of curious and inexplicable 3
utensils of myriad sorts. Then there were colossal caverns of intricate machinery 3
whose outlines and purpose were wholly strange to me, and whose sound 3
manifested itself only after many years of dreaming. I may here remark that sight 3
and sound are the only senses I have ever exercised in the visionary world. 3
3
The real horror began in May, 1915, when I first saw the living things. This was 3
before my studies had taught me what, in view of the myths and case histories, 3
to expect. As mental barriers wore down, I beheld great masses of thin vapour in 3
various parts of the building and in the streets below. 3
3
These steadily grew more solid and distinct, till at last I could trace their 3
monstrous outlines with uncomfortable ease. They seemed to be enormous, 3
iridescent cones, about ten feet high and ten feet wide at the base, and made up 3
of some ridgy, scaly, semi-elastic matter. From their apexes projected four 3
flexible, cylindrical members, each a foot thick, and of a ridgy substance like that 3
of the cones themselves. 3
3
These members were sometimes contracted almost to nothing, and sometimes 3
extended to any distance up to about ten feet. Terminating two of them were 3
enormous claws or nippers. At the end of a third were four red, trumpetlike 3
appendages. The fourth terminated in an irregular yellowish globe some two feet 3
in diameter and having three great dark eyes ranged along its central 3
circumference. 3
3
Surmounting this head were four slender grey stalks bearing flower-like 3
appendages, whilst from its nether side dangled eight greenish antennae or 3
3
3
3
714 3
3
3
3
tentacles. The great base of the central cone was fringed with a rubbery, grey 3
substance which moved the whole entity through expansion and contraction. 3
3
Their actions, though harmless, horrified me even more than their appearance - 3
for it is not wholesome to watch monstrous objects doing what one had known 3
only human beings to do. These objects moved intelligently about the great 3
rooms, getting books from the shelves and taking them to the great tables, or vice 3
versa, and sometimes writing diligently with a peculiar rod gripped in the 3
greenish head tentacles. The huge nippers were used in carrying books and in 3
conversation-speech consisting of a kind of clicking and scraping. 3
3
The objects had no clothing, but wore satchels or knapsacks suspended from the 3
top of the conical trunk. They commonly carried their head and its supporting 3
member at the level of the cone top, although it was frequently raised or 3
lowered. 3
3
The other three great members tended to rest downward at the sides of the cone, 3
contracted to about five feet each when not in use. From their rate of reading, 3
writing, and operating their machines - those on the tables seemed somehow 3
connected with thought - I concluded that their intelligence was enormously 3
greater than man's. 3
3
Aftenvard I saw them everywhere; swarming in all the great chambers and 3
corridors, tending monstrous machines in vaulted crypts, and racing along the 3
vast roads in gigantic, boat-shaped cars. I ceased to be afraid of them, for they 3
seemed to form supremely natural parts of their environment. 3
3
Individual differences amongst them began to be manifest, and a few appeared 3
to be under some kind of restraint. These latter, though shewing no physical 3
variation, had a diversity of gestures and habits which marked them off not only 3
from the majority, but very largely from one another. 3
3
They wrote a great deal in what seemed to my cloudy vision a vast variety of 3
characters - never the typical curvilinear hieroglyphs of the majority. A few, I 3
fancied, used our own familiar alphabet. Most of them worked much more 3
slowly than the general mass of the entities. 3
3
All this time my own part in the dreams seemed to be that of a disembodied 3
consciousness with a range of vision wider than the normal, floating freely 3
about, yet confined to the ordinary avenues and speeds of travel. Not until 3
August, 1915, did any suggestions of bodily existence begin to harass me. I say 3
harass, because the first phase was a purely abstract, though infinitely terrible, 3
association of my previously noted body loathing with the scenes of my visions. 3
3
3
3
715 3
3
3
3
For a while my chief concern during dreams was to avoid looking down at 3
myself, and I recall how grateful I was for the total absence of large mirrors in the 3
strange rooms. I was mightily troubled by the fact that I always saw the great 3
tables - whose height could not be under ten feet - from a level not below that of 3
their surfaces. 3
3
And then the morbid temptation to look down at myself became greater and 3
greater, till one night I could not resist it. At first my downward glance revealed 3
nothing whatever. A moment later I perceived that this was because my head lay 3
at the end of a flexible neck of enormous length. Retracting this neck and gazing 3
down very sharply, I saw the scaly, rugose, iridescent bulk of a vast cone ten feet 3
tall and ten feet wide at the base. That was when I waked half of Arkham with 3
my screaming as I plunged madly up from the abyss of sleep. 3
3
Only after weeks of hideous repetition did I grow half-reconciled to these visions 3
of myself in monstrous form. In the dreams I now moved bodily among the other 3
unknown entities, reading terrible books from the endless shelves and writing 3
for hours at the great tables with a stylus managed by the green tentacles that 3
hung down from my head. 3
3
Snatches of what I read and wrote would linger in my memory. There were 3
horrible annals of other worlds and other universes, and of stirrings of formless 3
life outside of all universes. There were records of strange orders of beings which 3
had peopled the world in forgotten pasts, and frightful chronicles of grotesque- 3
bodied intelligences which would people it millions of years after the death of 3
the last human being. 3
3
I learned of chapters in human history whose existence no scholar of today has 3
ever suspected. Most of these writings were in the language of the hieroglyphs; 3
which I studied in a queer way with the aid of droning machines, and which was 3
evidently an agglutinative speech with root systems utterly unlike any found in 3
human languages. 3
3
Other volumes were in other unknown tongues learned in the same queer way. 3
A very few were in languages I knew. Extremely clever pictures, both inserted in 3
the records and forming separate collections, aided me immensely. And all the 3
time I seemed to be setting down a history of my own age in English. On waking, 3
I could recall only minute and meaningless scraps of the unknown tongues 3
which my dream-self had mastered, though whole phrases of the history stayed 3
with me. 3
3
I learned - even before my waking self had studied the parallel cases or the old 3
myths from which the dreams doubtless sprang - that the entities around me 3
3
3
3
716 3
3
3
3
were of the world's greatest race, which had conquered time and had sent 3
exploring minds into every age. I knew, too, that I had been snatched from my 3
age while another used my body in that age, and that a few of the other strange 3
forms housed similarly captured minds. I seemed to talk, in some odd language 3
of claw clickings, with exiled intellects from every corner of the solar system. 3
3
There was a mind from the planet we know as Venus, which would live 3
incalculable epochs to come, and one from an outer moon of Jupiter six million 3
years in the past. Of earthly minds there were some from the winged, 3
starheaded, half-vegetable race of palaeogean Antarctica; one from the reptile 3
people of fabled Valusia; three from the furry pre-human Hyperborean 3
worshippers of Tsathoggua; one from the wholly abominable Tcho-Tchos; two 3
from the arachnid denizens of earth's last age; five from the hardy coleopterous 3
species immediately following mankind, to which the Great Race was some day 3
to transfer its keenest minds en masse in the face of horrible peril; and several 3
from different branches of humanity. 3
3
I talked with the mind of Yiang-Li, a philosopher from the cruel empire of Tsan- 3
Chan, which is to come in 5,000 A.D.; with that of a general of the greatheaded 3
brown people who held South Africa in 50,000 B.C.; with that of a twelfth- 3
century Florentine monk named Bartolomeo Corsi; with that of a king of Lomar 3
who had ruled that terrible polar land one hundred thousand years before the 3
squat, yellow Inutos came from the west to engulf it. 3
3
I talked with the mind of Nug-Soth, a magician of the dark conquerors of 16,000 3
A.D.; with that of a Roman named Titus Sempronius Blaesus, who had been a 3
quaestor in Sulla's time; with that of Khephnes, an Egyptian of the 14th Dynasty, 3
who told me the hideous secret of Nyarlathotep, with that of a priest of Atlantis' 3
middle kingdom; with that of a Suffolk gentleman of Cromwell's day, James 3
Woodville; with that of a court astronomer of pre-Inca Peru; with that of the 3
Australian physicist Nevil Kingston-Brown, who will die in 2,518 A.D.; with that 3
of an archimage of vanished Yhe in the Pacific; with that of Theodotides, a 3
Greco-Bactrian official Of 200 B.C.; with that of an aged Frenchman of Louis 3
XIII's time named Pierre-Louis Montagny; with that of Crom-Ya, a Cimmerian 3
chieftain of 15,000 B.C.; and with so many others that my brain cannot hold the 3
shocking secrets and dizzying marvels I learned from them. 3
3
I awaked each morning in a fever, sometimes frantically trying to verify or 3
discredit such information as fell within the range of modern human knowledge. 3
Traditional facts took on new and doubtful aspects, and I marvelled at the 3
dream-fancy which could invent such surprising addenda to history and science. 3
3
3
3
717 3
3
3
3
I shivered at the mysteries the past may conceal, and trembled at the menaces the 3
future may bring forth. What was hinted in the speech of post-human entities of 3
the fate of mankind produced such an effect on me that I will not set it down 3
here. 3
3
After man there would be the mighty beetle civilisation, the bodies of whose 3
members the cream of the Great Race would seize when the monstrous doom 3
overtook the elder world. Later, as the earth's span closed, the transferred minds 3
would again migrate through time and space - to another stopping-place in the 3
bodies of the bulbous vegetable entities of Mercury. But there would be races 3
after them, clinging pathetically to the cold planet and burrowing to its horror- 3
filled core, before the utter end. 3
3
Meanwhile, in my dreams, I wrote endlessly in that history of my own age which 3
I was preparing - half voluntarily and half through promises of increased library 3
and travel opportunities - for the Great Race's central archives. The archives were 3
in a colossal subterranean structure near the city's center, which I came to know 3
well through frequent labors and consultations. Meant to last as long as the race, 3
and to withstand the fiercest of earth's convulsions, this titan repository 3
surpassed all other buildings in the massive, mountain-like firmness of its 3
construction. 3
3
The records, written or printed on great sheets of a curiously tenacious cellulose 3
fabric were bound into books that opened from the top, and were kept in 3
individual cases of a strange, extremely light, restless metal of greyish hue, 3
decorated with mathematical designs and bearing the title in the Great Race's 3
curvilinear hieroglyphs. 3
3
These cases were stored in tiers of rectangular vaults-like closed, locked shelves - 3
wrought of the same rustless metal and fastened by knobs with intricate 3
turnings. My own history was assigned a specific place in the vaults of the lowest 3
or vertebrate level - the section devoted to the culture of mankind and of the 3
furry and reptilian races immediately preceding it in terrestrial dominance. 3
3
But none of the dreams ever gave me a full picture of daily life. All were the 3
merest misty, disconnected fragments, and it is certain that these fragments were 3
not unfolded in their rightful sequence. I have, for example, a very imperfect idea 3
of my own living arrangements in the dream-world; though I seem to have 3
possessed a great stone room of my own. My restrictions as a prisoner gradually 3
disappeared, so that some of the visions included vivid travels over the mighty 3
jungle roads, sojourns in strange cities, and explorations of some of the vast, 3
dark, windowless ruins from which the Great Race shrank in curious fear. There 3
were also long sea voyages in enormous, many-decked boats of incredible 3
3
3
3
718 3
3
3
3
swiftness, and trips over wild regions in closed projectile-like airships lifted and 3
moved by electrical repulsion. 3
3
Beyond the wide, warm ocean were other cities of the Great Race, and on one far 3
continent I saw the crude villages of the black-snouted, winged creatures who 3
would evolve as a dominant stock after the Great Race had sent its foremost 3
minds into the future to escape the creeping horror. Flatness and exuberant green 3
life were always the keynote of the scene. Hills were low and sparse, and usually 3
displayed signs of volcanic forces. 3
3
Of the animals I saw, I could write volumes. All were wild; for the Great Race's 3
mechanised culture had long since done away with domestic beasts, while food 3
was wholly vegetable or synthetic. Clumsy reptiles of great bulk floundered in 3
steaming morasses, fluttered in the heavy air, or spouted in the seas and lakes; 3
and among these I fancied I could vaguely recognise lesser, archaic prototypes of 3
many forms - dinosaurs, pterodactyls, ichthyosaurs, labyrinthodonts, 3
plesiosaurs, and the like-made familiar through palaeontology. Of birds or 3
mammals there were none that I could discover. 3
3
The ground and swamps were constantly alive with snakes, lizards, and 3
crocodiles while insects buzzed incessantly among the lush vegetation. And far 3
out at sea, unspied and unknown monsters spouted mountainous columns of 3
foam into the vaporous sky. Once I was taken under the ocean in a gigantic 3
submarine vessel with searchlights, and glimpsed some living horrors of 3
awesome magnitude. I saw also the ruins of incredible sunken cities, and the 3
wealth of crinoid, brachiopod, coral, and ichthyic life which everywhere 3
abounded. 3
3
Of the physiology, psychology, folkways, and detailed history of the Great Race 3
my visions preserved but little information, and many of the scattered points I 3
here set down were gleaned from my study of old legends and other cases rather 3
than from my own dreaming. 3
3
For in time, of course, my reading and research caught up with and passed the 3
dreams in many phases, so that certain dream-fragments were explained in 3
advance and formed verifications of what I had learned. This consolingly 3
established my belief that similar reading and research, accomplished by my 3
secondary self, had formed the source of the whole terrible fabric of 3
pseudomemories. 3
3
The period of my dreams, apparently, was one somewhat less than 150,000,000 3
years ago, when the Palaeozoic age was giving place to the Mesozoic. The bodies 3
occupied by the Great Race represented no surviving - or even scientifically 3
3
3
3
719 3
3
3
3
known-line of terrestrial evolution, but were of a peculiar, closely homogeneous, 3
and highly specialised organic type inclining as much as to the vegetable as to 3
the animal state. 3
3
Cell action was of an unique sort almost precluding fatigue, and wholly 3
eliminating the need of sleep. Nourishment, assimilated through the red 3
trumpet-like appendages on one of the great flexible limbs, was always semifluid 3
and in many aspects wholly unlike the food of existing animals. 3
3
The beings had but two of the senses which we recognise - sight and hearing, the 3
latter accomplished through the flower-like appendages on the grey stalks above 3
their heads. Of other and incomprehensible senses - not, however, well utilizable 3
by alien captive minds inhabiting their bodies - they possessed many. Their three 3
eyes were so situated as to give them a range of vision wider than the normal. 3
Their blood was a sort of deep-greenish ichor of great thickness. 3
3
They had no sex, but reproduced through seeds or spores which clustered on 3
their bases and could be developed only under water. Great, shallow tanks were 3
used for the growth of their young - which were, however, reared only in small 3
numbers on account of the longevity of individuals - four or five thousand years 3
being the common life span. 3
3
Markedly defective individuals were quickly disposed of as soon as their defects 3
were noticed. Disease and the approach of death were, in the absence of a sense 3
of touch or of physical pain, recognised by purely visual symptoms. 3
3
The dead were incinerated with dignified ceremonies. Once in a while, as before 3
mentioned, a keen mind would escape death by forward projection in time; but 3
such cases were not numerous. When one did occur, the exiled mind from the 3
future was treated with the utmost kindness till the dissolution of its unfamiliar 3
tenement. 3
3
The Great Race seemed to form a single, loosely knit nation or league, with major 3
institutions in common, though there were four definite divisions. The political 3
and economic system of each unit was a sort of fascistic socialism, with major 3
resources rationally distributed, and power delegated to a small governing board 3
elected by the votes of all able to pass certain educational and psychological tests. 3
Family organisation was not overstressed, though ties among persons of 3
common descent were recognised, and the young were generally reared by their 3
parents. 3
3
Resemblances to human attitudes and institutions were, of course, most marked 3
in those fields where on the one hand highly abstract elements were concerned. 3
3
3
3
720 3
3
3
3
or where on the other hand there was a dominance of the basic, unspeciahsed 3
urges common to all organic life. A few added likenesses came through 3
conscious adoption as the Great Race probed the future and copied what it liked. 3
3
Industry, highly mechanised, demanded but little time from each citizen; and the 3
abundant leisure was filled with intellectual and aesthetic activities of various 3
sorts. 3
3
The sciences were carried to an unbelievable height of development, and art was 3
a vital part of life, though at the period of my dreams it had passed its crest and 3
meridian. Technology was enormously stimulated through the constant struggle 3
to survive, and to keep in existence the physical fabric of great cities, imposed by 3
the prodigious geologic upheavals of those primal days. 3
3
Crime was surprisingly scant, and was dealt with through highly efficient 3
policing. Punishments ranged from privilege deprivation and imprisonment to 3
death or major emotion wrenching, and were never administered without a 3
careful study of the criminal's inotivations. 3
3
Warfare, largely civil for the last few millennia though sometimes waged against 3
reptilian or octopodic invaders, or against the winged, star-headed Old Ones 3
who centered in the antarctic, was infrequent though infinitely devastating. An 3
enormous army, using camera-like weapons which produced tremendous 3
electrical effects, was kept on hand for purposes seldom mentioned, but 3
obviously connected with the ceaseless fear of the dark, windowless elder ruins 3
and of the great sealed trap-doors in the lowest subterranean levels. 3
3
This fear of the basalt ruins and trap-doors was largely a matter of unspoken 3
suggestion - or, at most, of furtive quasi-whispers. Everything specific which 3
bore on it was significantly absent from such books as were on the common 3
shelves. It was the one subject lying altogether under a taboo among the Great 3
Race, and seemed to be connected alike with horrible bygone struggles, and with 3
that future peril which would some day force the race to send its keener minds 3
ahead en masse in time. 3
3
Imperfect and fragmentary as were the other things presented by dreams and 3
legends, this matter was still more bafflingly shrouded. The vague old myths 3
avoided it - or perhaps all allusions had for some reason been excised. And in the 3
dreams of myself and others, the hints were peculiarly few. Members of the 3
Great Race never intentionally referred to the matter, and what could be gleaned 3
came only from some of the more sharply observant captive minds. 3
3
3
3
721 3
3
3
3
According to these scraps of information, the basis of the fear was a horrible 3
elder race of half-polypous, utterly alien entities which had come through space 3
from immeasurably distant universes and had dominated the earth and three 3
other solar planets about 600 million years ago. They were only partly material - 3
as we understand matter - and their type of consciousness and media of 3
perception differed widely from those of terrestrial organisms. For example, their 3
senses did not include that of sight; their mental world being a strange, non- 3
visual pattern of impressions. 3
3
They were, however, sufficiently material to use implements of normal matter 3
when in cosmic areas containing it; and they required housing - albeit of a 3
peculiar kind. Though their senses could penetrate all material barriers, their 3
substance could not; and certain forms of electrical energy could wholly destroy 3
them. They had the power of aerial motion, despite the absence of wings or any 3
other visible means of levitation. Their minds were of such texture that no 3
exchange with them could be effected by the Great Race. 3
3
When these things had come to the earth they had built mighty basalt cities of 3
windowless towers, and had preyed horribly upon the beings they found. Thus it 3
was when the minds of the Great Race sped across the void from that obscure, 3
trans-galactic world known in the disturbing and debatable Eltdown Shards as 3
Yith. 3
3
The newcomers, with the instruments they created, had found it easy to subdue 3
the predatory entities and drive them down to those caverns of inner earth which 3
they had already joined to their abodes and begun to inhabit. 3
3
Then they had sealed the entrances and left them to their fate, afterward 3
occupying most of their great cities and preserving certain important buildings 3
for reasons connected more with superstition than with indifference, boldness, or 3
scientific and historical zeal. 3
3
But as the aeons passed there came vague, evil signs that the elder things were 3
growing strong and numerous in the inner world. There were sporadic 3
irruptions of a particularly hideous character in certain small and remote cities of 3
the Great Race, and in some of the deserted elder cities which the Great Race had 3
not peopled - places where the paths to the gulfs below had not been properly 3
sealed or guarded. 3
3
After that greater precautions were taken, and many of the paths were closed 3
forever - though a few were left with sealed trap-doors for strategic use in 3
fighting the elder things if ever they broke forth in unexpected places. 3
3
3
3
722 3
3
3
3
The irruptions of the elder things must have been shocking beyond all 3
description, since they had permanently coloured the psychology of the Great 3
Race. Such was the fixed mood of horror that the very aspect of the creatures was 3
left unmentioned. At no time was I able to gain a clear hint of what they looked 3
like. 3
3
There were veiled suggestions of a monstrous plasticity, and of temporary lapses 3
of visibility, while other fragmentary whispers referred to their control and 3
military use of great winds. Singular whistling noises, and colossal footprints 3
made up of five circular toe marks, seemed also to be associated with them. 3
3
It was evident that the coming doom so desperately feared by the Great Race - 3
the doom that was one day to send millions of keen minds across the chasm of 3
time to strange bodies in the safer future - had to do with a final successful 3
irruption of the elder beings. 3
3
Mental projections down the ages had clearly foretold such a horror, and the 3
Great Race had resolved that none who could escape should face it. That the 3
foray would be a matter of vengeance, rather than an attempt to reoccupy the 3
outer world, they knew from the planet's later history - for their projections 3
shewed the coming and going of subsequent races untroubled by the monstrous 3
entities. 3
3
Perhaps these entities had come to prefer earth's inner abysses to the variable, 3
storm-ravaged surface, since light meant nothing to them. Perhaps, too, they 3
were slowly weakening with the aeons. Indeed, it was known that they would be 3
quite dead in the time of the post-human beetle race which the fleeing minds 3
would tenant. 3
3
Meanwhile, the Great Race maintained its cautious vigilance, with potent 3
weapons ceaselessly ready despite the horrified banishing of the subject from 3
common speech and visible records. And always the shadow of nameless fear 3
hung bout the sealed trap-doors and the dark, windowless elder towers. 3
3
V 3
3
That is the world of which my dreams brought me dim, scattered echoes every 3
night. I cannot hope to give any true idea of the horror and dread contained in 3
such echoes, for it was upon a wholly intangible quality - the sharp sense of 3
pseudo-memory - that such feelings mainly depended. 3
3
As I have said, my studies gradually gave me a defence against these feelings in 3
the form of rational psychological explanations; and this saving influence was 3
3
3
3
723 3
3
3
3
augmented by the subtle touch of accustomedness which comes with the passage 3
of time. Yet in spite of everything the vague, creeping terror would return 3
momentarily now and then. It did not, however, engulf me as it had before; and 3
after 1922 I lived a very normal life of work and recreation. 3
3
In the course of years I began to feel that my experience - together with the 3
kindred cases and the related folklore - ought to be definitely summarised and 3
published for the benefit of serious students; hence I prepared a series of articles 3
briefly covering the whole ground and illustrated with crude sketches of some of 3
the shapes, scenes, decorative motifs, and hieroglyphs remembered from the 3
dreams. 3
3
These appeared at various times during 1928 and 1929 in the Journal of the 3
American Psychological Society, but did not attract much attention. Meanwhile I 3
continued to record my dreams with the minutest care, even though the growing 3
stack of reports attained troublesomely vast proportions. On July 10, 1934, there 3
was forwarded to me by the Psychological Society the letter which opened the 3
culminating and most horrible phase of the whole mad ordeal. It was 3
postmarked Pilbarra, Western Australia, and bore the signature of one whom I 3
found, upon inquiry, to be a mining engineer of considerable prominence. 3
Enclosed were some very curious snapshots. I will reproduce the text in its 3
entirety, and no reader can fail to understand how tremendous an effect it and 3
the photographs had upon me. 3
3
I was, for a time, almost stunned and incredulous; for although I had often 3
thought that some basis of fact must underlie certain phases of the legends which 3
had coloured my dreams, I was none the less unprepared for anything like a 3
tangible survival from a lost world remote beyond all imagination. Most 3
devastating of all were the photographs - for here, in cold, incontrovertible 3
realism, there stood out against a background of sand certain worn-down, water- 3
ridged, storm-weathered blocks of stone whose slightly convex tops and slightly 3
concave bottoms told their own story. 3
3
And when I studied them with a magnifying glass I could see all too plainly, 3
amidst the batterrings and pittings, the traces of those vast curvilinear designs 3
and occasional hieroglyphs whose significance had become so hideous to me. 3
But here is the letter, which speaks for itself. 3

My Dear Sir: 3
3
A recent conversation with Dr. E. M. Boyle of Perth, and some papers with your 3
articles which he has just sent me, make it advisable for me to tell you about 3
certain things I have seen in the Great Sandy Desert east of our gold field here. It 3
would seem, in view of the peculiar legends about old cities with huge 3
stonework and strange designs and hieroglyphs which you describe, that I have 3
come upon something very important. 3
3
The blackfellows have always been full of talk about "great stones with marks on 3
them," and seem to have a terrible fear of such things. They connect them in 3
some way with their common racial legends about Buddai, the gigantic old man 3
who lies asleep for ages underground with his head on his arm, and who will 3
some day awake and eat up the world. 3
3
There are some very old and half-forgotten tales of enormous underground huts 3
of great stones, where passages lead down and down, and where horrible things 3
have happened. The blackfellows claim that once some warriors, fleeing in battle, 3
went down into one and never came back, but that frightful winds began to blow 3
from the place soon after they went down. However, there usually isn't much in 3
what these natives say. 3
3
But what I have to tell is more than this. Two years ago, when I was prospecting 3
about 500 miles east in the desert, I came on a lot of queer pieces of dressed stone 3
perhaps 3X2X2 feet in size, and weathered and pitted to the very limit. 3
3
At first I couldn't find any of the marks the blackfellows told about, but when I 3
looked close enough I could make out some deeply carved lines in spite of the 3
weathering. There were peculiar curves, just like what the blackfellows had tried 3
to describe. I imagine there must have been thirty or forty blocks, some nearly 3
buried in the sand, and all within a circle perhaps a quarter of a mile in diameter. 3
3
When I saw some, I looked around closely for more, and made a careful 3
reckoning of the place with my instruments. I also took pictures of ten or twelve 3
of the most typical blocks, and will enclose the prints for you to see. 3
3
I turned my information and pictures over to the government at Perth, but they 3
have done nothing about them. 3
3
3
3
725 3
3
3
3
Then I met Dr. Boyle, who had read your articles in the Journal of the American 3
Psychological Society, and, in time, happened to mention the stones. He was 3
enormously interested, and became quite excited when I shewed him my 3
snapshots, saying that the stones and the markings were just like those of the 3
masonry you had dreamed about and seen described in legends. 3
3
He meant to write you, but was delayed. Meanwhile, he sent me most of the 3
magazines with your articles, and I saw at once, from your drawings and 3
descriptions, that my stones are certainly the kind you mean. You can appreciate 3
this from the enclosed prints. Later on you will hear directly from Dr. Boyle. 3
3
Now I can understand how important all this will be to you. Without question 3
we are faced with the remains of an unknown civilization older than any 3
dreamed of before, and forming a basis for your legends. 3
3
As a mining engineer, I have some knowledge of geology, and can tell you that 3
these blocks are so ancient they frighten me. They are mostly sandstone and 3
granite, though one is almost certainly made of a queer sort of cement or 3
concrete. 3
3
They bear evidence of water action, as if this part of the world had been 3
submerged and come up again after long ages - all since those blocks were made 3
and used. It is a matter of hundreds of thousands of years - or heaven knows 3
how much more. I don't like to think about it. 3
3
In view of your previous diligent work in tracking down the legends and 3
everything connected with them, I cannot doubt but that you will want to lead 3
an expedition to the desert and make some archaeological excavations. Both Dr. 3
Boyle and I are prepared to cooperate in such work if you - or organizations 3
known to you - can furnish the funds. 3
3
I can get together a dozen miners for the heavy digging - the blackfellows would 3
be of no use, for I've found that they have an almost maniacal fear of this 3
particular spot. Boyle and I are saying nothing to others, for you very obviously 3
ought to have precedence in any discoveries or credit. 3
3
The place can be reached from Pilbarra in about four days by motor tractor - 3
which we'd need for our apparatus. It is somewhat west and south of 3
Warburton's path of 1873, and 100 miles southeast of Joanna Spring. We could 3
float things up the De Grey River instead of starting from Pilbarra - but all that 3
can be talked over later. 3
3
3
3
726 3
3
3
3
Roughly the stones He at a point about 22° 3' 14" South Latitude, 125° 0' 39" East 3
Longitude. The chmate is tropical, and the desert conditions are trying. 3
3
I shall welcome further correspondence upon this subject, and am keenly eager 3
to assist in any plan you may devise. After studying your articles I am deeply 3
impressed with the profound significance of the whole matter. Dr. Boyle will 3
write later. When rapid communication is needed, a cable to Perth can be relayed 3
by wireless. 3
3
Hoping profoundly for an early message. 3
3
Believe me. 3
3
Most faithfully yours, 3

3
Of the immediate aftermath of this letter, much can be learned from the press. 3
My good fortune in securing the backing of Miskatonic University was great, and 3
both Mr. Mackenzie and Dr. Boyle proved invaluable in arranging matters at the 3
Australian end. We were not too specific with the public about our objects, since 3
the whole matter would have lent itself unpleasantly to sensational and jocose 3
treatment by the cheaper newspapers. As a result, printed reports were sparing; 3
but enough appeared to tell of our quest for reported Australian ruins and to 3
chronicle our various preparatory steps. 3
3
Professor William Dyer of the college's geology department - leader of the 3
Miskatonic Antarctic Expedition Of 1930-31 - Ferdinand C. Ashley of the 3
department of ancient history, and Tyler M. Freeborn of the department of 3
anthropology - together with my son Wingate - accompanied me. 3
3
My correspondent, Mackenzie, came to Arkham early in 1935 and assisted in our 3
final preparations. He proved to be a tremendously competent and affable man 3
of about fifty, admirably well-read, and deeply familiar with all the conditions of 3
Australian travel. 3
3
He had tractors waiting at Pilbarra, and we chartered a tramp steamer 3
sufficiently small to get up the river to that point. We were prepared to excavate 3
in the most careful and scientific fashion, sifting every particle of sand, and 3
disturbing nothing which might seem to be in or near its original situation. 3
3
Sailing from Boston aboard the wheezy Lexington on March 28, 1935, we had a 3
leisurely trip across the Atlantic and Mediterranean, through the Suez Canal, 3
down the Red Sea, and across the Indian Ocean to our goal. I need not tell how 3
the sight of the low, sandy West Australian coast depressed me, and how I 3
3
3
3
727 3
3
3
3
detested the crude mining town and dreary gold fields where the tractors were 3
given their last loads. 3
3
Dr. Boyle, who met us, proved to be elderly, pleasant, and intelligent - and his 3
knowledge of psychology led him into many long discussions with my son and 3
me. 3
3
Discomfort and expectancy were oddly mingled in most of us when at length our 3
party of eighteen rattled forth over the arid leagues of sand and rock. On Friday, 3
May 31st, we forded a branch of the De Grey and entered the realm of utter 3
desolation. A certain positive terror grew on me as we advanced to this actual 3
site of the elder world behind the legends - a terror, of course, abetted by the fact 3
that my disturbing dreams and pseudo-memories still beset me with unabated 3
force. 3
3
It was on Monday, June 3rd, that we saw the first of the half-buried blocks. I 3
cannot describe the emotions with which I actually touched - in objective reality - 3
a fragment of Cyclopean masonry in every respect like the blocks in the walls of 3
my dream-buildings. There was a distinct trace of carving - and my hands 3
trembled as I recognised part of a curvilinear decorative scheme made hellish to 3
me through years of tormenting nightmare and baffling research. 3
3
A month of digging brought a total of some 1250 blocks in varying stages of wear 3
and disintegration. Most of these were carven megaliths with curved tops and 3
bottoms. A minority were smaller, flatter, plain-surfaced, and square or 3
octagonally cut-like those of the floors and pavements in my dreams - while a 3
few were singularly massive and curved or slanted in such a manner as to 3
suggest use in vaulting or groining, or as parts of arches or round window 3
casings. 3
3
The deeper - and the farther north and east - we dug, the more blocks we found; 3
though we still failed to discover any trace of arrangement among them. 3
Professor Dyer was appalled at the measureless age of the fragments, and 3
Freeborn found traces of symbols which fitted darkly into certain Papuan and 3
Polynesian legends of infinite antiquity. The condition and scattering of the 3
blocks told mutely of vertiginous cycles of time and geologic upheavals of 3
cosmic savagery. 3
3
We had an aeroplane with us, and my son Wingate would often go up to 3
different heights and scan the sand-and-rock waste for signs of dim, large-scale 3
outlines - either differences of level or trails of scattered blocks. His results were 3
virtually negative; for whenever he would one day think he had glimpsed some 3
3
3
3
728 3
3
3
3
significant trend, he would on his next trip find the impression replaced by 3
another equally insubstantial - a result of the shifting, wind-blown sand. 3
3
One or two of these ephemeral suggestions, though, affected me queerly and 3
disagreeably. They seemed, after a fashion, to dovetail horribly with something I 3
had dreamed or read, but which I could no longer remember. There was a 3
terrible familiarity about them - which somehow made me look furtively and 3
apprehensively over the abominable, sterile terrain toward the north and 3
northeast. 3
3
Around the first week in July I developed an unaccountable set of mixed 3
emotions about that general northeasterly region. There was horror, and there 3
was curiosity - but more than that, there was a persistent and perplexing illusion 3
of memory. 3
3
I tried all sorts of psychological expedients to get these notions out of my head, 3
but met with no success. Sleeplessness also gained upon me, but I almost 3
welcomed this because of the resultant shortening of my dream-periods. I 3
acquired the habit of taking long, lone walks in the desert late at night-usually to 3
the north or northeast, whither the sum of my strange new impulses seemed 3
subtly to pull me. 3
3
Sometimes, on these walks, I would stumble over nearly buried fragments of the 3
ancient masonry. Though there were fewer visible blocks here than where we 3
had started, I felt sure that there must be a vast abundance beneath the surface. 3
The ground was less level than at our camp, and the prevailing high winds now 3
and then piled the sand into fantastic temporary hillocks - exposing low traces of 3
the elder stones while it covered other traces. 3
3
I was queerly anxious to have the excavations extend to this territory, yet at the 3
same time dreaded what might be revealed. Obviously, I was getting into a 3
rather bad state - all the worse because I could not account for it. 3
3
An indication of my poor nervous health can be gained from my response to an 3
odd discovery which I made on one of my nocturnal rambles. It was on the 3
evening of July Uth, when the moon flooded the mysterious hillocks with a 3
curious pallor. 3
3
Wandering somewhat beyond my usual limits, I came upon a great stone which 3
seemed to differ markedly from any we had yet encountered. It was almost 3
wholly covered, but I stooped and cleared away the sand with my hands, later 3
studying the object carefully and supplementing the moonlight with my electric 3
torch. 3
3
3
3
729 3
3
3
3
Unlike the other very large rocks, this one was perfectly square-cut, with no 3
convex or concave surface. It seemed, too, to be of a dark basaltic substance, 3
wholly dissimilar to the granite and sandstone and occasional concrete of the 3
now familiar fragments. 3
3
Suddenly I rose, turned, and ran for the camp at top speed. It was a wholly 3
unconscious and irrational flight, and only when I was close to my tent did I 3
fully realise why I had run. Then it came to me. The queer dark stone was 3
something which I had dreamed and read about, and which was linked with the 3
uttermost horrors of the aeon-old legendry. 3
3
It was one of the blocks of that basaltic elder masonry which the fabled Great 3
Race held in such fear - the tall, windowless ruins left by those brooding, half- 3
material, alien things that festered in earth's nether abysses and against whose 3
wind-like, invisible forces the trap-doors were sealed and the sleepless sentinels 3
posted. 3
3
I remained awake all night, but by dawn realised how silly I had been to let the 3
shadow of a myth upset me. Instead of being frightened, I should have had a 3
discoverer's enthusiasm. 3
3
The next forenoon I told the others about my find, and Dyer, Freeborn, Boyle, my 3
son, and I set out to view the anomalous block. Failure, however, confronted us. I 3
had formed no clear idea of the stone's location, and a late ind had wholly 3
altered the hillocks of shifting sand. 3
3
VI 3
3
I come now to the crucial and most difficult part of my narrative - all the more 3
difficult because I cannot be quite certain of its reality. At times I feel 3
uncomfortably sure that I was not dreaming or deluded; and it is this feelingin 3
view of the stupendous implications which the objective truth of my experience 3
would raise - which impels me to make this record. 3
3
My son - a trained psychologist with the fullest and most sympathetic 3
knowledge of my whole case - shall be the primary judge of what I have to tell. 3
3
First let me outline the externals of the matter, as those at the camp know them. 3
On the night of July 17-18, after a windy day, I retired early but could not sleep. 3
Rising shortly before eleven, and afflicted as usual with that strange feeling 3
regarding the northeastward terrain, I set out on one of my typical nocturnal 3
walks; seeing and greeting only one person - an Australian miner named Tupper 3
- as I left our precincts. 3
3
3
3
730 3
3
3
3
The moon, slightly past full, shone from a clear sky, and drenched the ancient 3
sands with a white, leprous radiance which seemed to me somehow infinitely 3
evil. There was no longer any wind, nor did any return for nearly five hours, as 3
amply attested by Tupper and others who saw me walking rapidly across the 3
pallid, secret-guarding hillocks toward the northeast. 3
3
About 3:30 a.m. a violent wind blew up, waking everyone in camp and felling 3
three of the tents. The sky was unclouded, and the desert still blazed with that 3
leprous moonlight. As the party saw to the tents my absence was noted, but in 3
view of my previous walks this circumstance gave no one alarm. And yet, as 3
many as three men - all Australians - seemed to feel something sinister in the air. 3
3
Mackenzie explained to Professor Freeborn that this was a fear picked up from 3
blackfellow folklore - the natives having woven a curious fabric of malignant 3
myth about the high winds which at long intervals sweep across the sands under 3
a clear sky. Such winds, it is whispered, blow out of the great stone huts under 3
the ground, where terrible things have happened - and are never felt except near 3
places where the big marked stones are scattered. Close to four the gale subsided 3
as suddenly as it had begun, leaving the sand hills in new and unfamiliar shapes. 3
3
It was just past five, with the bloated, fungoid moon sinking in the west, when I 3
staggered into camp - hatless, tattered, features scratched and ensanguined, and 3
without my electric torch. Most of the men had returned to bed, but Professor 3
Dyer was smoking a pipe in front of his tent. Seeing my winded and almost 3
frenzied state, he called Dr. Boyle, and the two of them got me on my cot and 3
made me comfortable. My son, roused by the stir, soon joined them, and they all 3
tried to force me to lie still and attempt sleep. 3
3
But there was no sleep for me. My psychological state was very extraordinary - 3
different from anything I had previously suffered. After a time I insisted upon 3
talking - nervously and elaborately explaining my condition. I told them I had 3
become fatigued, and had lain down in the sand for a nap. There had, I said, 3
been dreams even more frightful than usual - and when I was awaked by the 3
sudden high wind my overwrought nerves had snapped. I had fled in panic, 3
frequently falling over half-buried stones and thus gaining my tattered and 3
bedraggled aspect. I must have slept long - hence the hours of my absence. 3
3
Of anything strange either seen or experienced I hinted absolutely nothing - 3
exercising the greatest self-control in that respect. But I spoke of a change of 3
mind regarding the whole work of the expedition, and urged a halt in all digging 3
toward the northeast. My reasoning was patently weak - for I mentioned a 3
dearth of blocks, a wish not to offend the superstitious miners, a possible 3
shortage of funds from the college, and other things either untrue or irrelevant. 3
3
3
3
731 3
3
3
3
Naturally, no one paid the least attention to my new wishes - not even my son, 3
whose concern for my health was obvious. 3
3
The next day I was up and around the camp, but took no part in the excavations. 3
Seeing that I could not stop the work, I decided to return home as soon as 3
possible for the sake of my nerves, and made my son promise to fly me in the 3
plane to Perth - a thousand miles to the southwest - as soon as he had surveyed 3
the region I wished let alone. 3
3
If, I reflected, the thing I had seen was still visible, I might decide to attempt a 3
specific warning even at the cost of ridicule. It was just conceivable that the 3
miners who knew the local folklore might back me up. Humouring me, my son 3
made the survey that very afternoon, flying over all the terrain my walk could 3
possibly have covered. Yet nothing of what I had found remained in sight. 3
3
It was the case of the anomalous basalt block all over again - the shifting sand 3
had wiped out every trace. For an instant I half regretted having lost a certain 3
awesome object in my stark fright - but now I know that the loss was merciful. I 3
can still believe my whole experience an illusion - especially if, as I devoutly 3
hope, that hellish abyss is never found. 3
3
Wingate took me to Perth on July 20th, though declining to abandon the 3
expedition and return home. He stayed with me until the 25th, when the steamer 3
for Liverpool sailed. Now, in the cabin of the Empress, I am pondering long and 3
frantically upon the entire matter, and have decided that my son at least must be 3
informed. It shall rest with him whether to diffuse the matter more widely. 3
3
In order to meet any eventuality I have prepared this summary of my 3
background - as already known in a scattered way to others - and will now tell as 3
briefly as possible what seemed to happen during my absence from the camp 3
that hideous night. 3
3
Nerves on edge, and whipped into a kind of perverse eagerness by that 3
inexplicable, dread-mingled, mnemonic urge toward the northeast, I plodded on 3
beneath the evil, burning moon. Here and there I saw, half shrouded by sand, 3
those primal Cyclopean blocks left from nameless and forgotten aeons. 3
3
The incalculable age and brooding horror of this monstrous waste began to 3
oppress me as never before, and I could not keep from thinking of my 3
maddening dreams, of the frightful legends which lay behind them, and of the 3
present fears of natives and miners concerning the desert and its carven stones. 3
3
3
3
732 3
3
3
3
And yet I plodded on as if to some eldritch rendezvous - more and more assailed 3
by bewildering fancies, compulsions, and pseudo-memories. I thought of some 3
of the possible contours of the lines of stones as seen by my son from the air, and 3
wondered why they seemed at once so ominous and so familiar. Something was 3
fumbling and rattling at the latch of my recollection, while another unknown 3
force sought to keep the portal barred. 3
3
The night was windless, and the pallid sand curved upward and downward like 3
frozen waves of the sea. I had no goal, but somehow ploughed along as if with 3
fate-bound assurance. My dreams welled up into the waking world, so that each 3
sand-embedded megalith seemed part of endless rooms and corridors of pre- 3
human masonry, carved and hieroglyphed with symbols that I knew too well 3
from years of custom as a captive mind of the Great Race. 3
3
At moments I fancied I saw those omniscient, conical horrors moving about at 3
their accustomed tasks, and I feared to look down lest I find myself one with 3
them in aspect. Yet all the while I saw the sand-covered blocks as well as the 3
rooms and corridors; the evil, burning moon as well as the lamps of luminous 3
crystal; the endless desert as well as the waving ferns beyond the windows. I was 3
awake and dreaming at the same time. 3
3
I do not know how long or how far - or indeed, in just what direction -I had 3
walked when I first spied the heap of blocks bared by the day's wind. It was the 3
largest group in one place that I had seen so far, and so sharply did it impress me 3
that the visions of fabulous aeons faded suddenly away. 3
3
Again there were only the desert and the evil moon and the shards of an 3
unguessed past. I drew close and paused, and cast the added light of my electric 3
torch over the tumbled pile. A hillock had blown away, leaving a low, irregularly 3
round mass of megaliths and smaller fragments some forty feet across and from 3
two to eight feet high. 3
3
From the very outset I realized that there was some utterly unprecedented 3
quality about those stones. Not only was the mere number of them quite without 3
parallel, but something in the sandworn traces of design arrested me as I scanned 3
them under the mingled beams of the moon and my torch. 3
3
Not that any one differed essentially from the earlier specimens we had found. It 3
was something subtler than that. The impression did not come when I looked at 3
one block alone, but only when I ran my eye over several almost simultaneously. 3
3
Then, at last, the truth dawned upon me. The curvilinear patterns on many of 3
those blocks were closely related - parts of one vast decorative conception. For 3
3
3
3
733 3
3
3
3
the first time in this aeon-shaken waste I had come upon a mass of masonry in its 3
old position - tumbled and fragmentary, it is true, but none the less existing in a 3
very definite sense. 3
3
Mounting at a low place, I clambered laboriously over the heap; here and there 3
clearing away the sand with my fingers, and constantly striving to interpret 3
varieties of size, shape, and style, and relationships of design. 3
3
After a while I could vaguely guess at the nature of the bygone structure, and at 3
the designs which had once stretched over the vast surfaces of the primal 3
masonry. The perfect identity of the whole with some of my dream-glimpses 3
appalled and unnerved me. 3
3
This was once a Cyclopean corridor thirty feet tall, paved with octagonal blocks 3
and solidly vaulted overhead. There would have been rooms opening off on the 3
right, and at the farther end one of those strange inclined planes would have 3
wound down to still lower depths. 3
3
I started violently as these conceptions occurred to me, for there was more in 3
them than the blocks themselves had supplied. How did I know that this level 3
should have been far underground? How did I know that the plane leading 3
upward should have been behind me? How did I know that the long subterrene 3
passage to the Square of Pillars ought to lie on the left one level above me? 3
3
How did I know that the room of machines and the rightward-leading tunnel to 3
the central archives ought to lie two levels below? How did I know that there 3
would be one of those horrible, metal-banded trap-doors at the very bottom four 3
levels down? Bewildered by this intrusion from the dream-world, I found myself 3
shaking and bathed in a cold perspiration. 3
3
Then, as a last, intolerable touch, I felt that faint, insidious stream of cool air 3
trickling upward from a depressed place near the center of the huge heap. 3
Instantly, as once before, my visions faded, and I saw again only the evil 3
moonlight, the brooding desert, and the spreading tumulus of palaeogean 3
masonry. Something real and tangible, yet fraught with infinite suggestions of 3
nighted mystery, now confronted me. For that stream of air could argue but one 3
thing - a hidden gulf of great size beneath the disordered blocks on the surface. 3
3
My first thought was of the sinister blackfellow legends of vast underground 3
huts among the megaliths where horrors happen and great winds are born. Then 3
thoughts of my own dreams came back, and I felt dim pseudo-memories tugging 3
at my mind. What manner of place lay below me? What primal, inconceivable 3
3
3
3
734 3
3
3
3
source of age-old myth-cycles and haunting nightmares might I be on the brink 3
of uncovering? 3
3
It was only for a moment that I hesitated, for more than curiosity and scientific 3
zeal was driving me on and working against my growing fear. 3
3
I seemed to move almost automatically, as if in the clutch of some compelling 3
fate. Pocketing my torch, and struggling with a strength that I had not thought I 3
possessed, I wrenched aside first one titan fragment of stone and then another, 3
till there welled up a strong draught whose dampness contrasted oddly with the 3
deserts dry air. A black rift began to yawn, and at length - when I had pushed 3
away every fragment small enough to budge - the leprous moonlight blazed on 3
an aperture of ample width to admit me. 3
3
I drew out my torch and cast a brilliant beam into the opening. Below me was a 3
chaos of tumbled masonry, sloping roughly down toward the north at an angle 3
of about forty-five degrees, and evidently the result of some bygone collapse 3
from above. 3
3
Between its surface and the ground level was a gulf of impenetrable blackness at 3
whose upper edge were signs of gigantic, stress-heaved vaulting. At this point, it 3
appeared, the deserts sands lay directly upon a floor of some titan structure of 3
earth's youth - how preserved through aeons of geologic convulsion I could not 3
then and cannot now even attempt to guess. 3
3
In retrospect, the barest idea of a sudden, lone descent into such a doubtful abyss 3
- and at a time when one's whereabouts were unknown to any living soul - 3
seems like the utter apex of insanity. Perhaps it was - yet that night I embarked 3
without hesitancy upon such a descent. 3
3
Again there was manifest that lure and driving of fatality which had all along 3
seemed to direct my course. With torch flashing intermittently to save the 3
battery, I commenced a mad scramble down the sinister, Cyclopean incline 3
below the opening - sometimes facing forward as I found good hand - and foot- 3
holds, and at other times turning to face the heap of megaliths as I clung and 3
fumbled more precariously. 3
3
In two directions beside me distant walls of carven, crumbling masonry loomed 3
dimly under the direct beams of my torch. Ahead, however, was only unbroken 3
darkness. 3
3
I kept no track of time during my downward scramble. So seething with baffling 3
hints and images was my mind that all objective matters seemed withdrawn into 3
3
3
3
735 3
3
3
3
incalculable distances. Physical sensation was dead, and even fear remained as a 3
wraith-like, inactive gargoyle leering impotently at me. 3
3
Eventually, I reached a level floor strewn with fallen blocks, shapeless fragments 3
of stone, and sand and detritus of every kind. On either side - perhaps thirty feet 3
apart - rose massive walls culminating in huge groinings. That they were carved 3
I could just discern, but the nature of the carvings was beyond my perception. 3
3
What held me the most was the vaulting overhead. The beam from my torch 3
could not reach the roof, but the lower parts of the monstrous arches stood out 3
distinctly. And so perfect was their identity with what I had seen in countless 3
dreams of the elder world, that I trembled actively for the first time. 3
3
Behind and high above, a faint luminous blur told of the distant moonlit world 3
outside. Some vague shred of caution warned me that I should not let it out of 3
my sight, lest I have no guide for my return. 3
3
I now advanced toward the wall at my left, where the traces of carving were 3
plainest. The littered floor was nearly as hard to traverse as the downward heap 3
had been, but I managed to pick my difficult way. 3
3
At one place I heaved aside some blocks and locked away the detritus to see 3
what the pavement was like, and shuddered at the utter, fateful familiarity of the 3
great octagonal stones whose buckled surface still held roughly together. 3
3
Reaching a convenient distance from the wall, I cast the searchlight slowly and 3
carefully over its worn remnants of carving. Some bygone influx of water seemed 3
to have acted on the sandstone surface, while there were curious incrustations 3
which I could not explain. 3
3
In places the masonry was very loose and distorted, and I wondered how many 3
aeons more this primal, hidden edifice could keep its remaining traces of form 3
amidst earth's heavings. 3
3
But it was the carvings themselves that excited me most. Despite their time- 3
crumbled state, they were relatively easy to trace at close range; and the 3
complete, intimate familiarity of every detail almost stunned my imagination. 3
3
That the major attributes of this hoary masonry should be familiar, was not 3
beyond normal credibility. 3
3
Powerfully impressing the weavers of certain myths, they had become embodied 3
in a stream of cryptic lore which, somehow, coming to my notice during the 3
amnesic period, had evoked vivid images in my subconscious mind. 3
3
3
3
736 3
3
3
3
But how could I explain the exact and minute fashion in which each line and 3
spiral of these strange designs tallied with what I had dreamed for more than a 3
score of years? What obscure, forgotten iconography could have reproduced 3
each subtle shading and nuance which so persistently, exactly, and unvaryingly 3
besieged my sleeping vision night after night? 3
3
For this was no chance or remote resemblance. Definitely and absolutely, the 3
millennially ancient, aeon-hidden corridor in which I stood was the original of 3
something I knew in sleep as intimately as I knew my own house in Crane Street, 3
Arkham. True, my dreams shewed the place in its undecayed prime; but the 3
identity was no less real on that account. I was wholly and horribly oriented. 3
3
The particular structure I was in was known to me. Known, too, was its place in 3
that terrible elder city of dreams. That I could visit unerringly any point in that 3
structure or in that city which had escaped the changes and devastations of 3
uncounted ages, I realized with hideous and instinctive certainty. What in 3
heaven's name could all this mean? How had I come to know what I knew? And 3
what awful reality could lie behind those antique tales of the beings who had 3
dwelt in this labyrinth of primordial stone? 3
3
Words can convey only fractionally the welter of dread and bewilderment which 3
ate at my spirit. I knew this place. I knew what lay before me, and what had lain 3
overhead before the myriad towering stories had fallen to dust and debris and 3
the desert. No need now, I thought with a shudder, to keep that faint blur of 3
moonlight in view. 3
3
I was torn betwixt a longing to flee and a feverish mixture of burning curiosity 3
and driving fatality. What had happened to this monstrous megalopolis of old in 3
the millions of years since the time of my dreams? Of the subterrene mazes 3
which had underlain the city and linked all the titan towers, how much had still 3
survived the writhings of earth's crust? 3
3
Had I come upon a whole buried world of unholy archaism? Could I still find the 3
house of the writing master, and the tower where S'gg'ha, the captive mind from 3
the star-headed vegetable carnivores of Antarctica, had chiselled certain pictures 3
on the blank spaces of the walls? 3
3
Would the passage at the second level down, to the hall of the alien minds, be 3
still unchoked and traversable? In that hall the captive mind of an incredible 3
entity - a half-plastic denizen of the hollow interior of an unknown trans- 3
Plutonian planet eighteen million years in the future - had kept a certain thing 3
which it had modelled from clay. 3
3
3
3
737 3
3
3
3
I shut my eyes and put my hand to my head in a vain, pitiful effort to drive these 3
insane dream-fragments from my consciousness. Then, for the first time, I feh 3
acutely the coolness, motion, and dampness of the surrounding air. Shuddering, 3
I realized that a vast chain of aeon-dead black gulfs must indeed be yawning 3
somewhere beyond and below me. 3
3
I thought of the frightful chambers and corridors and inclines as I recalled them 3
from my dreams. Would the way to the central archives still be open? Again that 3
driving fatality tugged insistently at my brain as I recalled the awesome records 3
that once lay cased in those rectangular vaults of rustless metal. 3
3
There, said the dreams and legends, had reposed the whole history, past and 3
future, of the cosmic space-time continuum - written by captive minds from 3
every orb and every age in the solar system. Madness, of course - but had I not 3
now stumbled into a nighted world as mad as I? 3
3
I thought of the locked metal shelves, and of the curious knob twistings needed 3
to open each one. My own came vividly into my consciousness. How often had I 3
gone through that intricate routine of varied turns and pressures in the terrestrial 3
vertebrate section on the lowest level! Every detail was fresh and familiar. 3
3
If there were such a vault as I had dreamed of, I could open it in a moment. It 3
was then that madness took me utterly. An instant later, and I was leaping and 3
stumbling over the rocky debris toward the well-remembered incline to the 3
depths below. 3
3
VII 3
3
From that point forward my impressions are scarcely to be relied on - indeed, I 3
still possess a final, desperate hope that they all form parts of some daemonic 3
dream or illusion born of delirium. A fever raged in my brain, and everything 3
came to me through a kind of haze - sometimes only intermittently. 3
3
The rays of my torch shot feebly into the engulfing blackness, bringing 3
phantasmal flashes of hideously familiar walls and carvings, all blighted with the 3
decay of ages. In one place a tremendous mass of vaulting had fallen, so that I 3
had to clamber over a mighty mound of stones reaching almost to the ragged, 3
grotesquely stalactited roof. 3
3
It was all the ultimate apex of nightmare, made worse by the blasphemous tug of 3
pseudo-memory. One thing only was unfamiliar, and that was my own size in 3
relation to the monstrous masonry. I felt oppressed by a sense of unwonted 3
smallness, as if the sight of these towering walls from a mere human body was 3
3
3
3
738 3
3
3
3
something wholly new and abnormal. Again and again I looked nervously down 3
at myself, vaguely disturbed by the human form I possessed. 3
3
Onward through the blackness of the abyss I leaped, plunged, and staggered - 3
often falling and bruising myself, and once nearly shattering my torch. Every 3
stone and corner of that daemonic gulf was known to me, and at many points I 3
stopped to cast beams of light through choked and crumbling, yet familiar, 3
archways. 3
3
Some rooms had totally collapsed; others were bare, or debris-filled. In a few I 3
saw masses of metal - some fairly intact, some broken, and some crushed or 3
battered - which I recognised as the colossal pedestals or tables of my dreams. 3
What they could in truth have been, I dared not guess. 3
3
I found the downward incline and began its descent - though after a time halted 3
by a gaping, ragged chasm whose narrowest point could not be much less than 3
four feet across. Here the stonework had fallen through, revealing incalculable 3
inky depths beneath. 3
3
I knew there were two more cellar levels in this titan edifice, and trembled with 3
fresh panic as I recalled the metal-clamped trap-door on the lowest one. There 3
could be no guards now - for what had lurked beneath had long since done its 3
hideous work and sunk into its long decline. By the time of the posthuman beetle 3
race it would be quite dead. And yet, as I thought of the native legends, I 3
trembled anew. 3
3
It cost me a terrible effort to vault that yawning chasm, since the littered floor 3
prevented a running start - but madness drove me on. I chose a place close to the 3
left-hand wall - where the rift was least wide and the landing-spot reasonably 3
clear of dangerous debris - and after one frantic moment reached the other side 3
in safety. 3
3
At last, gaining the lower level, I stumbled on past the archway of the room of 3
machines, within which were fantastic ruins of metal, half buried beneath fallen 3
vaulting. Everything was where I knew it would be, and I climbed confidently 3
over the heaps which barred the entrance of a vast transverse corridor. This, I 3
realised, would take me under the city to the central archives. 3
3
Endless ages seemed to unroll as I stumbled, leaped, and crawled along that 3
debris-cluttered corridor. Now and then I could make out carvings on the ages- 3
tained walls - some familiar, others seemingly added since the period of my 3
dreams. Since this was a subterrene house - connecting highway, there were no 3
archways save when the route led through the lower levels of various buildings. 3
3
3
3
739 3
3
3
3
At some of these intersections I turned aside long enough to look down well- 3
remembered corridors and into well-remembered rooms. Twice only did I find 3
any radical changes from what I had dreamed of - and in one of these cases I 3
could trace the sealed-up outlines of the archway I remembered. 3
3
I shook violently, and felt a curious surge of retarding weakness, as I steered a 3
hurried and reluctant course through the crypt of one of those great windowless, 3
ruined towers whose alien, basalt masonry bespoke a whispered and horrible 3
origin. 3
3
This primal vault was round and fully two hundred feet across, with nothing 3
carved upon the dark-hued stonework. The floor was here free from anything 3
save dust and sand, and I could see the apertures leading upward and 3
downward. There were no stairs or inclines - indeed, my dreams had pictured 3
those elder towers as wholly untouched by the fabulous Great Race. Those who 3
had built them had not needed stairs or inclines. 3
3
In the dreams, the downward aperture had been tightly sealed and nervously 3
guarded. Now it lay open-black and yawning, and giving forth a current of cool, 3
damp air. Of what limitless caverns of eternal night might brood below, I would 3
not permit myself to think. 3
3
Later, clawing my way along a badly heaped section of the corridor, I reached a 3
place where the roof had wholly caved in. The debris rose like a mountain, and I 3
climbed up over it, passing through a vast, empty space where my torchlight 3
could reveal neither walls nor vaulting. This, I reflected, must be the cellar of the 3
house of the metal-purveyors, fronting on the third square not far from the 3
archives. What had happened to it I could not conjecture. 3
3
I found the corridor again beyond the mountain of detritus and stone, but after a 3
short distance encountered a wholly choked place where the fallen vaulting 3
almost touched the perilously sagging ceiling. How I managed to wrench and 3
tear aside enough blocks to afford a passage, and how I dared disturb the tightly 3
packed fragments when the least shift of equilibrium might have brought down 3
all the tons of superincumbent masonry to crush me to nothingness, I do not 3
know. 3
3
It was sheer madness that impelled and guided me - if, indeed, my whole 3
underground adventure was not - as I hope - a hellish delusion or phase of 3
dreaming. But I did make - or dream that I made - a passage that I could squirm 3
through. As I wiggled over the mound of debris - my torch, switched 3
continuously on, thrust deeply in my mouth - I felt myself torn by the fantastic 3
stalactites of the jagged floor above me. 3
3
3
3
740 3
3
3
3
I was now close to the great underground archival structure which seemed to 3
form my goal. Sliding and clambering down the farther side of the barrier, and 3
picking my way along the remaining stretch of corridor with hand-held, 3
intermittently flashing torch, I came at last to a low, circular crypt with arches - 3
still in a marvelous state of preservation - opening off on every side. 3
3
The walls, or such parts of them as lay within reach of my torchlight, were 3
densely hieroglyphed and chiselled with typical curvilinear symbols - some 3
added since the period of my dreams. 3
3
This, I realised, was my fated destination, and I turned at once through a familiar 3
archway on my left. That I could find a clear passage up and down the incline to 3
all the surviving levels, I had, oddly, little doubt. This vast, earth-protected pile, 3
housing the annals of all the solar system, had been built with supernal skill and 3
strength to last as long as that system itself. 3
3
Blocks of stupendous size, poised with mathematical genius and bound with 3
cements of incredible toughness, had combined to form a mass as firm as the 3
planet's rocky core. Here, after ages more prodigious than I could sanely grasp, 3
its buried bulk stood in all its essential contours, the vast, dust-drifted floors 3
scarce sprinkled with the litter elsewhere so dominant. 3
3
The relatively easy walking from this point onward went curiously to my head. 3
All the frantic eagerness hitherto frustrated by obstacles now took itself out in a 3
kind of febrile speed, and I literally raced along the low-roofed, monstrously 3
well-remembered aisles beyond the archway. 3
3
I was past being astonished by the familiarity of what I saw. On every hand the 3
great hieroglyphed metal shelf-doors loomed monstrously; some yet in place, 3
others sprung open, and still others bent and buckled under bygone geological 3
stresses not quite strong enough to shatter the titan masonry. 3
3
Here and there a dust-covered heap beneath a gaping, empty shelf seemed to 3
indicate where cases had been shaken down by earth tremors. On occasional 3
pillars were great symbols or letters proclaiming classes and subclasses of 3
volumes. 3
3
Once I paused before an open vault where I saw some of the accustomed metal 3
cases still in position amidst the omnipresent gritty dust. Reaching up, I 3
dislodged one of the thinner specimens with some difficulty, and rested it on the 3
floor for inspection. It was titled in the prevailing curvilinear hieroglyphs, 3
though something in the arrangement of the characters seemed subtly unusual. 3
3
3
3
741 3
3
3
3
The odd mechanism of the hooked fastener was perfectly well known to me, and 3
I snapped up the still rustless and workable lid and drew out the book within. 3
The latter, as expected, was some twenty by fifteen inches in area, and two inches 3
thick; the thin metal covers opening at the top. 3
3
Its tough cellulose pages seemed unaffected by the myriad cycles of time they 3
had lived through, and I studied the queerly pigmented, brush-drawn letters of 3
the text-symbols unlike either the usual curved hieroglyphs or any alphabet 3
known to human scholarship - with a haunting, half-aroused memory. 3
3
It came to me that this was the language used by a captive mind I had known 3
slightly in my dreams - a mind from a large asteroid on which had survived 3
much of the archaic life and lore of the primal planet whereof it formed a 3
fragment. At the same time I recalled that this level of the archives was devoted 3
to volumes dealing with the non-terrestrial planets. 3
3
As I ceased poring over this incredible document I saw that the light of my torch 3
was beginning to fail, hence quickly inserted the extra battery I always had with 3
me. Then, armed with the stronger radiance, I resumed my feverish racing 3
through unending tangles of aisles and corridors - recognising now and then 3
some familiar shelf, and vaguely annoyed by the acoustic conditions which made 3
my footfalls echo incongruously in these catacombs. 3
3
The very prints of my shoes behind me in the millennially untrodden dust made 3
me shudder. Never before, if my mad dreams held anything of truth, had human 3
feet pressed upon those immemorial pavements. 3
3
Of the particular goal of my insane racing, my conscious mind held no hint. 3
There was, however, some force of evil potency pulling at my dazed will and 3
buried recollection, so that I vaguely felt I was not running at random. 3
3
I came to a downward incline and followed it to profounder depths. Floors 3
flashed by me as I raced, but I did not pause to explore them. In my whirling 3
brain there had begun to beat a certain rhythm which set my right hand 3
twitching in unison. I wanted to unlock something, and felt that I knew all the 3
intricate twists and pressures needed to do it. It would be like a modern safe 3
with a combination lock. 3
3
Dream or not, I had once known and still knew. How any dream - or scrap of 3
unconsciously absorbed legend - could have taught me a detail so minute, so 3
intricate, and so complex, I did not attempt to explain to myself. I was beyond all 3
coherent thought. For was not this whole experience - this shocking familiarity 3
with a set of unknown ruins, and this monstrously exact identity of everything 3
3
3
3
742 3
3
3
3
before me with what only dreams and scraps of myth could have suggested - a 3
horror beyond all reason? 3
3
Probably it was my basic conviction then - as it is now during my saner moments 3
3
- that I was not awake at all, and that the entire buried city was a fragment of 3
febrile hallucination. 3
3
Eventually, I reached the lowest level and struck off to the right of the incline. 3
For some shadowy reason I tiled to soften my steps, even though I lost speed 3
thereby. There was a space I was afraid to cross on this last, deeply buried floor. 3
3
As I drew near it I recalled what thing in that space I feared. It was merely one of 3
the metal-barred and closely guarded trap-doors. There would be no guards 3
now, and on that account I trembled and tiptoed as I had done in passing 3
through that black basalt vault where a similar trap-door had yawned. 3
3
I felt a current of cool, damp air as I had felt there, and wished that my course led 3
in another direction. Why I had to take the particular course I was taking, I did 3
not know. 3
3
When I came to the space I saw that the trap-door yawned widely open. Ahead, 3
the shelves began again, and I glimpsed on the floor before one of them a heap 3
very thinly covered with dust, where a number of cases had recently fallen. At 3
the same moment a fresh wave of panic clutched me, though for some time I 3
could not discover why. 3
3
Heaps of fallen cases were not uncommon, for all through the aeons this lightless 3
labyrinth had been racked by the heavings of earth and had echoed at intervals 3
of the deafening clatter of toppling objects. It was only when I was nearly across 3
the space that I realized why I shook so violently. 3
3
Not the heap, but something about the dust of the level floor was troubling me. 3
In the light of my torch it seemed as if that dust were not as even as it ought to be 3
3
- there were places where it looked thinner, as if it had been disturbed not many 3
months before. I could not be sure, for even the apparently thinner places were 3
dusty enough; yet a certain suspicion of regularity in the fancied unevenness was 3
highly disquieting. 3
3
When I brought the torchlight close to one of the queer places I did not like what 3
I saw - for the illusion of regularity became very great. It was as if there were 3
regular lines of composite impressions - impressions that went in threes, each 3
slightly over a foot square, and consisting of five nearly circular three-inch prints, 3
one in advance of the other four. 3
3
3
3
743 3
3
3
3
These possible lines of foot-square impressions appeared to lead in two 3
directions, as if something had gone somewhere and returned. They were, of 3
course, very faint, and may have been illusions or accidents; but there was an 3
element of dim, fumbling terror about the way I thought they ran. For at one end 3
of them was the heap of cases which must have clattered down not long before, 3
while at the other end was the ominous trap-door with the cool, damp wind, 3
yawning unguarded down to abysses past imagination. 3
3
VIII 3
3
That my strange sense of compulsion was deep and overwhelming is shewn by 3
its conquest of my fear. No rational motive could have drawn me on after that 3
hideous suspicion of prints and the creeping dream-memories it excited. Yet my 3
right hand, even as it shook with fright, still twitched rhythmically in its 3
eagerness to turn a lock it hoped to find. Before I knew it I was past the heap of 3
lately fallen cases and running on tiptoe through aisles of utterly unbroken dust 3
toward a point which I seemed to know morbidly, horribly well. 3
3
My mind was asking itself questions whose origin and relevancy I was only 3
beginning to guess. Would the shelf be reachable by a human body? Could my 3
human hand master all the aeon-remembered motions of the lock? Would the 3
lock be undamaged and workable? And what would I do - what dare I do with 3
what - as I now commenced to realise - 1 both hoped and feared to find? Would it 3
prove the awesome, brain-shattering truth of something past normal conception, 3
or shew only that I was dreaming? 3
3
The next I knew I had ceased my tiptoed racing and was standing still, staring at 3
a row of maddeningly familiar hieroglyphed shelves. They were in a state of 3
almost perfect preservation, and only three of the doors in this vicinity had 3
sprung open. 3
3
My feelings toward these shelves cannot be described - so utter and insistent was 3
the sense of old acquaintance. I was looking high up at a row near the top and 3
wholly out of my reach, and wondering how I could climb to best advantage. An 3
open door four rows from the bottom would help, and the locks of the closed 3
doors formed possible holds for hands and feet. I would grip the torch between 3
my teeth, as I had in other places where both hands were needed. Above all I 3
must make no noise. 3
3
How to get down what I wished to remove would be difficult, but I could 3
probably hook its movable fastener in my coat collar and carry it like a knapsack. 3
Again I wondered whether the lock would be undamaged. That I could repeat 3
3
3
3
744 3
3
3
3
each familiar motion I had not the least doubt. But I hoped the thing would not 3
scrape or creak - and that my hand could work it properly. 3
3
Even as I thought these things I had taken the torch in my mouth and begun to 3
climb. The projecting locks were poor supports; but, as I had expected, the 3
opened shelf helped greatly. I used both the swinging door and the edge of the 3
aperture itself in my ascent, and managed to avoid any loud creaking. 3
3
Balanced on the upper edge of the door, and leaning far to my right, I could just 3
reach the lock I sought. My fingers, half numb from climbing, were very clumsy 3
at first; but I soon saw that they were anatomically adequate. And the memory- 3
rhythm was strong in them. 3
3
Out of unknown gulfs of time the intricate, secret motions had somehow reached 3
my brain correctly in every detail - for after less than five minutes of trying there 3
came a click whose familiarity was all the more startling because I had not 3
consciously anticipated it. In another instant the metal door was slowly swinging 3
open with only the faintest grating sound. 3
3
Dazedly I looked over the row of greyish case ends thus exposed, and felt a 3
tremendous surge of some wholly inexplicable emotion. Just within reach of my 3
right hand was a case whose curving hieroglyphs made me shake with a pang 3
infinitely more complex than one of mere fright. Still shaking, I managed to 3
dislodge it amidst a shower of gritty flakes, and ease it over toward myself 3
without any violent noise. 3
3
Like the other case I had handled, it was slightly more than twenty by fifteen 3
inches in size, with curved mathematical designs in low relief. In thickness it just 3
exceeded three inches. 3
3
Crudely wedging it between myself and the surface I was climbing, I fumbled 3
with the fastener and finally got the hook free. Lifting the cover, I shifted the 3
heavy object to my back, and let the hook catch hold of my collar. Hands now 3
free, I awkwardly clambered down to the dusty floor, and prepared to inspect 3
my prize. 3
3
Kneeling in the gritty dust, I swung the case around and rested it in front of me. 3
My hands shook, and I dreaded to draw out the book within almost as much as I 3
longed - and felt compelled - to do so. It had very gradually become clear to me 3
what I ought to find, and this realisation nearly paralysed my faculties. 3
3
If the thing were there - and if I were not dreaining - the implications would be 3
quite beyond the power of the human spirit to bear. What tormented me most 3
3
3
3
745 3
3
3
3
was my momentary inability to feel that my surroundings were a dream. The 3
sense of reality was hideous - and again becomes so as I recall the scene. 3
3
At length I tremblingly pulled the book from its container and stared 3
fascinatedly at the well-known hieroglyphs on the cover. It seemed to be in 3
prime condition, and the curvilinear letters of the title held me in almost as 3
hypnotised a state as if I could read them. Indeed, I cannot swear that I did not 3
actually read them in some transient and terrible access of abnormal memory. 3
3
I do not know how long it was before I dared to lift that thin metal cover. I 3
temporized and made excuses to myself. I took the torch from my mouth and 3
shut it off to save the battery. Then, in the dark, I collected my courage finally 3
lifting the cover without turning on the light. Last of all, I did indeed flash the 3
torch upon the exposed page - steeling myself in advance to suppress any sound 3
no matter what I should find. 3
3
I looked for an instant, then collapsed. Clenching my teeth, however, I kept 3
silent. I sank wholly to the floor and put a hand to my forehead amidst the 3
engulfing blackness. What I dreaded and expected was there. Either I was 3
dreaming, or time and space had become a mockery. 3
3
I must be dreaming - but I would test the horror by carrying this thing back and 3
shewing it to my son if it were indeed a reality. My head swam frightfully, even 3
though there were no visible objects in the unbroken gloom to swirl about me. 3
Ideas and images of the starkest terror - excited by vistas which my glimpse had 3
opened up - began to throng in upon me and cloud my senses. 3
3
I thought of those possible prints in the dust, and trembled at the sound of my 3
own breathing as I did so. Once again I flashed on the light and looked at the 3
page as a serpent's victim may look at his destroyer's eyes and fangs. 3
3
Then, with clumsy fingers, in the dark, I closed the book, put it in its container, 3
and snapped the lid and the curious, hooked fastener. This was what I must 3
carry back to the outer world if it truly existed - if the whole abyss truly existed - 3
if I, and the world itself, truly existed. 3
3
Just when I tottered to my feet and commenced my return I cannot be certain. It 3
comes to me oddly - as a measure of my sense of separation from the normal 3
world - that I did not even once look at my watch during those hideous hours 3
nderground. 3
3
Torch in hand, and with the ominous case under one arm, I eventually found 3
myself tiptoeing in a kind of silent panic past the draught - giving abyss and 3
3
3
3
746 3
3
3
3
those lurking suggestions of prints. I lessened my precautions as I climbed up the 3
endless inclines, but could not shake off a shadow of apprehension which I had 3
not felt on the downward journey. 3
3
I dreaded having to repass through the black basalt crypt that was older than the 3
city itself, where cold draughts welled up from unguarded depths. I thought of 3
that which the Great Race had feared, and of what might still be lurking - be it 3
ever so weak and dying - down there. I thought of those five-circle prints and of 3
what my dreams had told me of such prints - and of strange winds and whistling 3
noises associated with them. And I thought of the tales of the modern 3
blackfellows, wherein the horror of great winds and nameless subterrene ruins 3
was dwelt upon. 3
3
I knew from a carven wall symbol the right floor to enter, and came at last after 3
passing that other book I had examined - to the great circular space with the 3
branching archways. On my right, and at once recognisable, was the arch 3
through which I had arrived. This I now entered, conscious that the rest of my 3
course would be harder because of the tumbled state of the masonry outside the 3
archive building. My new metal-eased burden weighed upon me, and I found it 3
harder and harder to be quiet as I stumbled among debris and fragments of 3
every sort. 3
3
Then I came to the ceiling-high mound of debris through which I had wrenched 3
a scanty passage. My dread at wriggling through again was infinite, for my first 3
passage had made some noise, and I now - after seeing those possible prints - 3
dreaded sound above all things. The case, too, doubled the problem of traversing 3
the narrow crevice. 3
3
But I clambered up the barrier as best I could, and pushed the case through the 3
aperture ahead of me. Then, torch in mouth, I scrambled through myself - my 3
back torn as before by stalactites. 3
3
As I tried to grasp the case again, it fell some distance ahead of me down the 3
slope of the debris, making a disturbing clatter and arousing echoes which sent 3
me into a cold perspiration. I lunged for it at once, and regained it without 3
further noise - but a moment afterward the slipping of blocks under my feet 3
raised a sudden and unprecedented din. 3
3
The din was my undoing. For, falsely or not, I thought I heard it answered in a 3
terrible way from spaces far behind me. I thought I heard a shrill, whistling 3
sound, like nothing else on earth, and beyond any adequate verbal description. If 3
so, what followed has a grim irony - since, save for the panic of this thing, the 3
second thing might never have happened. 3
3
3
3
747 3
3
3
3
As it was, my frenzy was absolute and unrelieved. Taking my torch in my hand 3
and clutching feebly at the case, I leaped and bounded wildly ahead with no idea 3
in my brain beyond a mad desire to race out of these nightmare ruins to the 3
waking world of desert and moonlight which lay so far above. 3
3
I hardly knew it when I reached the mountain of debris which towered into the 3
vast blackness beyond the caved-in roof, and bruised and cut myself repeatedly 3
in scrambling up its steep slope of jagged blocks and fragments. 3
3
Then came the great disaster. Just as I blindly crossed the summit, unprepared 3
for the sudden dip ahead, my feet slipped utterly and I found myself involved in 3
a mangling avalanche of sliding masonry whose cannon-loud uproar split the 3
black cavern air in a deafening series of earth-shaking reverberations. 3
3
I have no recollection of emerging from this chaos, but a momentary fragment of 3
consciousness shows me as plunging and tripping and scrambling along the 3
corridor amidst the clangour - case and torch still with me. 3
3
Then, just as I approached that primal basalt crypt I had so dreaded, utter 3
madness came. For as the echoes of the avalanche died down, there became 3
audible a repetition of that frightful alien whistling I thought I had heard before. 3
This time there was no doubt about it - and what was worse, it came from a point 3
not behind but ahead of me. 3
3
Probably I shrieked aloud then. I have a dim picture of myself as flying through 3
the hellish basalt vault of the elder things, and hearing that damnable alien 3
sound piping up from the open, unguarded door of limitless nether blacknesses. 3
There was a wind, too - not merely a cool, damp draught, but a violent, 3
purposeful blast belching savagely and frigidly from that abominable gulf 3
whence the obscene whistling came. 3
3
There are memories of leaping and lurching over obstacles of every sort, with 3
that torrent of wind and shrieking sound growing moment by moment, and 3
seeming to curl and twist purposefully around me as it struck out wickedly from 3
the spaces behind and beneath. 3
3
Though in my rear, that wind had the odd effect of hindering instead of aiding 3
my progress; as if it acted like a noose or lasso thrown around me. Heedless of 3
the noise I made, I clattered over a great barrier of blocks and was again in the 3
structure that led to the surface. 3
3
I recall glimpsing the archway to the room of machines and almost crying out as 3
I saw the incline leading down to where one of those blasphemous trap-doors 3
3
3
3
748 3
3
3
3
must be yawning two levels below. But instead of crying out I muttered over and 3
over to myself that this was all a dream from which I must soon awake. Perhaps I 3
was in camp - perhaps I was at home in Arkham. As these hopes bolstered up 3
my sanity I began to mount the incline to the higher level. 3
3
I knew, of course, that I had the four-foot cleft to re-cross, yet was too racked by 3
other fears to realise the full horror until I came almost upon it. On my descent, 3
the leap across had been easy - but could I clear the gap as readily when going 3
uphill, and hampered by fright, exhaustion, the weight of the metal case, and the 3
anomalous backward tug of that daemon wind? I thought of these things at the 3
last moment, and thought also of the nameless entities which might be lurking in 3
the black abysses below the chasm. 3
3
My wavering torch was growing feeble, but I could tell by some obscure memory 3
when I neared the cleft. The chill blasts of wind and the nauseous whistling 3
shrieks behind me were for the moment like a merciful opiate, dulling my 3
imagination to the horror of the yawning gulf ahead. And then I became aware 3
of the added blasts and whistling in front of me - tides of abomination surging 3
up through the cleft itself from depths unimagined and unimaginable. 3
3
Now, indeed, the essence of pure nightmare was upon me. Sanity departed - 3
and, ignoring everything except the animal impulse of flight, I merely struggled 3
and plunged upward over the incline's debris as if no gulf had existed. Then I 3
saw the chasm's edge, leaped frenziedly with every ounce of strength I 3
possessed, and was instantly engulfed in a pandaemoniae vortex of loathsome 3
sound and utter, materially tangible blackness. 3
3
This is the end of my experience, so far as I can recall. Any further impressions 3
belong wholly to the domain of phantasmagoria delirium. Dream, madness, and 3
memory merged wildly together in a series of fantastic, fragmentary delusions 3
which can have no relation to anything real. 3
3
There was a hideous fall through incalculable leagues of viscous, sentient 3
darkness, and a babel of noises utterly alien to all that we know of the earth and 3
its organic life. Dormant, rudimentary senses seemed to start into vitality within 3
me, telling of pits and voids peopled by floating horrors and leading to sunless 3
crags and oceans and teeming cities of windowless, basalt towers upon which no 3
light ever shone. 3
3
Secrets of the primal planet and its immemorial aeons flashed through my brain 3
without the aid of sight or sound, and there were known to me things which not 3
even the wildest of my former dreams had ever suggested. And all the while 3
cold fingers of damp vapor clutched and picked at me, and that eldritch. 3
3
3
3
749 3
3
3
3
damnable whistling shrieked fiendishly above all the alternations of babel and 3
silence in the whirlpools of darkness around. 3
3
Afterward there were visions of the Cyclopean city of my dreams - not in ruins, 3
but just as I had dreamed of it. I was in my conical, non-human body again, and 3
mingled with crowds of the Great Race and the captive minds who carried books 3
up and down the lofty corridors and vast inclines. 3
3
Then, superimposed upon these pictures, were frightful, momentary flashes of a 3
non-vistial consciousness involving desperate struggles, a writhing free from 3
clutching tentacles of whistling wind, an insane, bat-like flight through half-solid 3
air, a feverish burrowing through the cyclone-whipped dark, and a wild 3
stumbling and scrambling over fallen masonry. 3
3
Once there was a curious, intrusive flash of half sight - a faint, diffuse suspicion 3
of bluish radiance far overhead. Then there came a dream of wind - pursued 3
climbing and crawling - of wriggling into a blaze of sardonic moonlight through 3
a jumble of debris which slid and collapsed after me amidst a morbid hurricane. 3
It was the evil, monotonous beating of that maddening moonlight which at last 3
told me of the return of what I had once known as the objective, waking world. 3
3
I was clawing prone through the sands of the Australian desert, and around me 3
shrieked such a tumult of wind as I had never before known on our planet's 3
surface. My clothing was in rags, and my whole body was a mass of bruises and 3
scratches. 3
3
Full consciousness returned very slowly, and at no time could I tell just where 3
delirious dream left off and true memory began. There had seemed to be a 3
mound of titan blocks, an abyss beneath it, a monstrous revelation from the past, 3
and a nightmare horror at the end - but how much of this was real? 3
3
My flashlight was gone, and likewise any metal case I may have discovered. Had 3
there been such a case - or any abyss- or any mound? Raising my head, I looked 3
behind me, and saw only the sterile, undulant sands of the desert. 3
3
The daemon wind died down, and the bloated, fungoid moon sank reddeningly 3
in the west. I lurched to my feet and began to stagger southwestward toward the 3
camp. What in truth had happened to me? Had I merely collapsed in the desert 3
and dragged a dream-racked body over miles of sand and buried blocks? If not, 3
how could I bear to live any longer? 3
3
For, in this new doubt, all my faith in the myth-born unreality of my visions 3
dissolved once more into the hellish older doubting. If that abyss was real, then 3
3
3
3
750 3
3
3
3
the Great Race was real - and its blasphemous reachings and seizures in the 3
cosmos-wide vortex of time were no myths or nightmares, but a terrible, soul- 3
shattering actuality. 3
3
Had I, in full, hideous fact, been drawn back to a pre-human world of a hundred 3
and fifty million years ago in those dark, baffling days of the amnesia? Had my 3
present body been the vehicle of a frightful alien consciousness from palaeogean 3
gulfs of time? 3
3
Had I, as the captive mind of those shambling horrors, indeed known that 3
accursed city of stone in its primordial heyday, and wriggled down those 3
familiar corridors in the loathsome shape of my captor? Were those tormenting 3
dreams of more than twenty years the offspring of stark, monstrous memories? 3
3
Had I once veritably talked with minds from reachless corners of time and space, 3
learned the universe's secrets, past and to come, and written the annals of my 3
own world for the metal cases of those titan archives? And were those others - 3
those shocking elder things of the mad winds and daemon pipings - in truth a 3
lingering, lurking menace, waiting and slowly weakening in black abysses while 3
varied shapes of life drag out their multimillennial courses on the planet's age- 3
racked surface? 3
3
I do not know. If that abyss and what I held were real, there is no hope. Then, all 3
too truly, there lies upon this world of man a mocking and incredible shadow out 3
of time. But, mercifully, there is no proof that these things are other than fresh 3
phases of my myth-born dreams. I did not bring back the metal case that would 3
have been a proof, and so far those subterrene corridors have not been found. 3
3
If the laws of the universe are kind, they will never be found. But I must tell my 3
son what I saw or thought I saw, and let him use his judgment as a psychologist 3
in gauging the reality of my experience, and communicating this account to 3
others. 3
3
I have said that the awful truth behind my tortured years of dreaming hinges 3
absolutely upon the actuality of what I thought I saw in those Cyclopean, buried 3
ruins. It has been hard for me, literally, to set down that crucial revelation, 3
though no reader can have failed to guess it. Of course, it lay in that book within 3
the metal case - the case which I pried out of its lair amidst the dust of a million 3
centuries. 3
3
No eye had seen, no hand had touched that book since the advent of man to this 3
planet. And yet, when I flashed my torch upon it in that frightful abyss, I saw 3
that the queerly pigmented letters on the brittle, aeon-browned cellulose pages 3
3
3
3
751 3
3
3
3
were not indeed any nameless hieroglyphs of earth's youth. They were, instead, 3
the letters of our familiar alphabet, spelling out the words of the English 3
language in my own handwriting. 3

The Shadow Over Innsmouth 3
3
Written in 1931 3
3
Published in 1936 in The Shadow over Innsmouth 3
3
3
3
During the winter of 1927-28 officials of the Federal government made a strange 3
and secret investigation of certain conditions in the ancient Massachusetts 3
seaport of Innsmouth. The public first learned of it in February, when a vast 3
series of raids and arrests occurred, followed by the deliberate burning and 3
dynamiting - under suitable precautions - of an enormous number of crumbling, 3
worm-eaten, and supposedly empty houses along the abandoned waterfront. 3
Uninquiring souls let this occurrence pass as one of the major clashes in a 3
spasmodic war on liquor. 3
3
Keener news-followers, however, wondered at the prodigious number of arrests, 3
the abnormally large force of men used in making them, and the secrecy 3
surrounding the disposal of the prisoners. No trials, or even definite charges 3
were reported; nor were any of the captives seen thereafter in the regular gaols of 3
the nation. There were vague statements about disease and concentration camps, 3
and later about dispersal in various naval and military prisons, but nothing 3
positive ever developed. Innsmouth itself was left almost depopulated, and it is 3
even now only beginning to show signs of a sluggishly revived existence. 3
3
Complaints from many liberal organizations were met with long confidential 3
discussions, and representatives were taken on trips to certain camps and 3
prisons. As a result, these societies became surprisingly passive and reticent. 3
Newspaper men were harder to manage, but seemed largely to cooperate with 3
the government in the end. Only one paper - a tabloid always discounted 3
because of its wild policy - mentioned the deep diving submarine that 3
discharged torpedoes downward in the marine abyss just beyond Devil Reef. 3
That item, gathered by chance in a haunt of sailors, seemed indeed rather far- 3
fetched; since the low, black reef lay a full mile and a half out from Innsmouth 3
Harbour. 3
3
People around the country and in the nearby towns muttered a great deal among 3
themselves, but said very little to the outer world. They had talked about dying 3
and half-deserted Innsmouth for nearly a century, and nothing new could be 3
wilder or more hideous than what they had whispered and hinted at years 3
before. Many things had taught them secretiveness, and there was no need to 3
3
3
3
753 3
3
3
3
exert pressure on them. Besides, they really knew little; for wide salt marshes, 3
desolate and unpeopled, kept neighbors off from Innsmouth on the landward 3
side. 3
3
But at last I am going to defy the ban on speech about this thing. Results, I am 3
certain, are so thorough that no public harm save a shock of repulsion could ever 3
accrue from a hinting of what was found by those horrified men at Innsmouth. 3
Besides, what was found might possibly have more than one explanation. I do 3
not know just how much of the whole tale has been told even to me, and I have 3
many reasons for not wishing to probe deeper. For my contact with this affair 3
has been closer than that of any other layman, and I have carried away 3
impressions which are yet to drive me to drastic measures. 3
3
It was I who fled frantically out of Innsmouth in the early morning hours of July 3
16, 1927, and whose frightened appeals for government inquiry and action 3
brought on the whole reported episode. I was willing enough to stay mute while 3
the affair was fresh and uncertain; but now that it is an old story, with public 3
interest and curiosity gone, I have an odd craving to whisper about those few 3
frightful hours in that ill-rumored and evilly-shadowed seaport of death and 3
blasphemous abnormality. The mere telling helps me to restore confidence in my 3
own faculties; to reassure myself that I was not the first to succumb to a 3
contagious nightmare hallucination. It helps me, too, in making up my mind 3
regarding a certain terrible step which lies ahead of me. 3
3
I never heard of Innsmouth till the day before I saw it for the first and - so far - 3
last time. I was celebrating my coming of age by a tour of New England - 3
sightseeing, antiquarian, and genealogical - and had planned to go directly from 3
ancient Newburyport to Arkham, whence my mother's family was derived. I had 3
no car, but was travelling by train, trolley and motor-coach, always seeking the 3
cheapest possible route. In Newburyport they told me that the steam train was 3
the thing to take to Arkham; and it was only at the station ticket-office, when I 3
demurred at the high fare, that I learned about Innsmouth. The stout, shrewd- 3
faced agent, whose speech shewed him to be no local man, seemed sympathetic 3
toward my efforts at economy, and made a suggestion that none of my other 3
informants had offered. 3
3
"You could take that old bus, I suppose," he said with a certain hesitation, "but it 3
ain't thought much of hereabouts. It goes through Innsmouth - you may have 3
heard about that - and so the people don't like it. Run by an Innsmouth fellow - 3
Joe Sargent - but never gets any custom from here, or Arkham either, I guess. 3
Wonder it keeps running at all. I s'pose it's cheap enough, but I never see mor'n 3
two or three people in it - nobody but those Innsmouth folk. Leaves the square - 3
3
3
3

3
3
3
front of Hammond's Drug Store - at 10 a.m. and 7 p.m. unless they've changed 3
lately. Looks like a terrible rattletrap - I've never been on it." 3
3
That was the first I ever heard of shadowed Innsmouth. Any reference to a town 3
not shown on common maps or listed in recent guidebooks would have 3
interested me, and the agent's odd manner of allusion roused something like real 3
curiosity. A town able to inspire such dislike in it its neighbors, I thought, must 3
be at least rather unusual, and worthy of a tourist's attention. If it came before 3
Arkham I would stop off there and so I asked the agent to tell me something 3
about it. He was very deliberate, and spoke with an air of feeling slightly 3
superior to what he said. 3
3
"Innsmouth? Well, it's a queer kind of a town down at the mouth of the 3
Manuxet. Used to be almost a city - quite a port before the War of 1812 - but all 3
gone to pieces in the last hundred years or so. No railroad now - B. and M. never 3
went through, and the branch line from Rowley was given up years ago. 3
3
"More empty houses than there are people, I guess, and no business to speak of 3
except fishing and lobstering. Everybody trades mostly either here or in Arkham 3
or Ipswich. Once they had quite a few mills, but nothing's left now except one 3
gold refinery running on the leanest kind of part time. 3
3
"That refinery, though, used to he a big thing, and old man Marsh, who owns it, 3
must be richer'n Croesus. Queer old duck, though, and sticks mighty close in his 3
home. He's supposed to have developed some skin disease or deformity late in 3
life that makes him keep out of sight. Grandson of Captain Obed Marsh, who 3
founded the business. His mother seems to've been some kind of foreigner - they 3
say a South Sea islander - so everybody raised Cain when he married an Ipswich 3
girl fifty years ago. They always do that about Innsmouth people, and folks here 3
and hereabouts always try to cover up any Innsmouth blood they have in 'em. 3
But Marsh's children and grandchildren look just like anyone else far's I can see. 3
I've had 'em pointed out to me here - though, come to think of it, the elder 3
children don't seem to be around lately. Never saw the old man. 3
3
"And why is everybody so down on Innsmouth? Well, young fellow, you 3
mustn't take too much stock in what people here say. They're hard to get started, 3
but once they do get started they never let up. They've been telling things about 3
Innsmouth - whispering 'em, mostly - for the last hundred years, I guess, and I 3
gather they're more scared than anything else. Some of the stories would make 3
you laugh - about old Captain Marsh driving bargains with the devil and 3
bringing imps out of hell to live in Innsmouth, or about some kind of devil- 3
worship and awful sacrifices in some place near the wharves that people 3
3
3
3
7bb 3
3
3
3
stumbled on around 1845 or thereabouts - but I come from Panton, Vermont, and 3
that kind of story don't go down with me. 3
3
"You ought to hear, though, what some of the old-timers tell about the black reef 3
off the coast - Devil Reef, they call it. It's well above water a good part of the 3
time, and never much below it, but at that you could hardly call it an island. The 3
story is that there's a whole legion of devils seen sometimes on that reef - 3
sprawled about, or darting in and out of some kind of caves near the top. It's a 3
rugged, uneven thing, a good bit over a mile out, and toward the end of shipping 3
days sailors used to make big detours just to avoid it. 3
3
"That is, sailors that didn't hail from Innsmouth. One of the things they had 3
against old Captain Marsh was that he was supposed to land on it sometimes at 3
night when the tide was right. Maybe he did, for I dare say the rock formation 3
was interesting, and it's just barely possible he was looking for pirate loot and 3
maybe finding it; but there was talk of his dealing with demons there. Fact is, I 3
guess on the whole it was really the Captain that gave the bad reputation to the 3
reef. 3
3
"That was before the big epidemic of 1846, when over half the folks in 3
Innsmouth was carried off. They never did quite figure out what the trouble was, 3
but it was probably some foreign kind of disease brought from China or 3
somewhere by the shipping. It surely was bad enough - there was riots over it, 3
and all sorts of ghastly doings that I don't believe ever got outside of town - and 3
it left the place in awful shape. Never came back - there can't be more'n 300 or 3
400 people living there now. 3
3
"But the real thing behind the way folks feel is simply race prejudice - and I don't 3
say I'm blaming those that hold it. I hate those Innsmouth folks myself, and I 3
wouldn't care to go to their town. I s'pose you know - though I can see you're a 3
Westerner by your talk - what a lot our New England ships - used to have to do 3
with queer ports in Africa, Asia, the South Seas, and everywhere else, and what 3
queer kinds of people they sometimes brought back with 'em. You've probably 3
heard about the Salem man that came home with a Chinese wife, and maybe you 3
know there's still a bunch of Fiji Islanders somewhere around Cape Cod. 3
3
"Well, there must be something like that back of the Innsmouth people. The 3
place always was badly cut off from the rest of the country by marshes and 3
creeks and we can't be sure about the ins and outs of the matter; but it's pretty 3
clear that old Captain Marsh must have brought home some odd specimens 3
when he had all three of his ships in commission back in the twenties and 3
thirties. There certainly is a strange kind of streak in the Innsmouth folks today - 3
I don't know how to explain it but it sort of makes you crawl. You'll notice a little 3
3
3
3
756 3
3
3
3
in Sargent if you take his bus. Some of 'em have queer narrow heads with flat 3
noses and bulgy, starry eyes that never seem to shut, and their skin ain't quite 3
right. Rough and scabby, and the sides of the necks are all shriveled or creased 3
up. Get bald, too, very young. The older fellows look the worst - fact is, I don't 3
believe I've ever seen a very old chap of that kind. Guess they must die of 3
looking in the glass! Animals hate 'em - they used to have lots of horse trouble 3
before the autos came in. 3
3
"Nobody around here or in Arkham or Ipswich will have anything to do with 3
'em, and they act kind of offish themselves when they come to town or when 3
anyone tries to fish on their grounds. Queer how fish are always thick off 3
Innsmouth Harbour when there ain't any anywhere else around - but just try to 3
fish there yourself and see how the folks chase you off! Those people used to 3
come here on the railroad - walking and taking the train at Rowley after the 3
branch was dropped - but now they use that bus. 3
3
"Yes, there's a hotel in Innsmouth - called the Gilman House - but I don't believe 3
it can amount to much. I wouldn't advise you to try it. Better stay over here and 3
take the ten o'clock bus tomorrow morning; then you can get an evening bus 3
there for Arkham at eight o'clock. There was a factory inspector who stopped at 3
the Gilman a couple of years ago and he had a lot of unpleasant hints about the 3
place. Seems they get a queer crowd there, for this fellow heard voices in other 3
rooms - though most of 'em was empty - that gave him the shivers. It was foreign 3
talk he thought, but he said the bad thing about it was the kind of voice that 3
sometimes spoke. It sounded so unnatural - slopping like, he said - that he didn't 3
dare undress and go to sleep. Just waited up and lit out the first thing in the 3
morning. The talk went on most all night. 3
3
"This fellow - Casey, his name was - had a lot to say about how the Innsmouth 3
folk, watched him and seemed kind of on guard. He found the Marsh refinery a 3
queer place - it's in an old mill on the lower falls of the Manuxet. What he said 3
tallied up with what I'd heard. Books in bad shape, and no clear account of any 3
kind of dealings. You know it's always been a kind of mystery where the 3
Marshes get the gold they refine. They've never seemed to do much buying in 3
that line, but years ago they shipped out an enormous lot of ingots. 3
3
"Used to be talk of a queer foreign kind of jewelry that the sailors and refinery 3
men sometimes sold on the sly, or that was seen once or twice on some of the 3
Marsh women-folks. People allowed maybe old Captain Obed traded for it in 3
some heathen port, especially since he always ordered stacks of glass beads and 3
trinkets such as seafaring men used to get for native trade. Others thought and 3
still think he'd found an old pirate cache out on Devil Reef. But here's a funny 3
thing. The old Captain's been dead these sixty years, and there's ain't been a 3
3
3
3
7b7 3
3
3
3
good-sized ship out of the place since the Civil War; but just the same the 3
Marshes still keep on buying a few of those native trade things - mostly glass and 3
rubber gewgaws, they tell me. Maybe the Innsmouth folks like 'em to look at 3
themselves - Gawd knows they've gotten to be about as bad as South Sea 3
cannibals and Guinea savages. 3
3
"That plague of '46 must have taken off the best blood in the place. Anyway, 3
they're a doubtful lot now, and the Marshes and other rich folks are as bad as 3
any. As I told you, there probably ain't more'n 400 people in the whole town in 3
spite of all the streets they say there are. I guess they're what they call 'white 3
trash' down South - lawless and sly, and full of secret things. They get a lot of 3
fish and lobsters and do exporting by truck. Queer how the fish swarm right 3
there and nowhere else. 3
3
"Nobody can ever keep track of these people, and state school officials and 3
census men have a devil of a time. You can bet that prying strangers ain't 3
welcome around Innsmouth. I've heard personally of more'n one business or 3
government man that's disappeared there, and there's loose talk of one who 3
went crazy and is out at Danvers now. They must have fixed up some awful 3
scare for that fellow. 3
3
"That's why I wouldn't go at night if I was you. I've never been there and have 3
no wish to go, but I guess a daytime trip couldn't hurt you - even though the 3
people hereabouts will advise you not to make it. If you're just sightseeing, and 3
looking for old-time stuff, Innsmouth ought to be quite a place for you." 3
3
And so I spent part of that evening at the Newburyport Public Library looking 3
up data about Innsmouth. When I had tried to question the natives in the shops, 3
the lunchroom, the garages, and the fire station, I had found them even harder to 3
get started than the ticket agent had predicted; and realized that I could not 3
spare the time to overcome their first instinctive reticence. They had a kind of 3
obscure suspiciousness, as if there were something amiss with anyone too much 3
interested in Innsmouth. At the Y. M. C. A., where I was stopping, the clerk 3
merely discouraged my going to such a dismal, decadent place; and the people at 3
the library shewed much the same attitude. Clearly, in the eyes of the educated, 3
Innsmouth was merely an exaggerated case of civic degeneration. 3
3
The Essex County histories on the library shelves had very little to say, except 3
that the town was founded in 1643, noted for shipbuilding before the Revolution, 3
a seat of great marine prosperity in the early 19th century, and later a minor 3
factory center using the Manuxet as power. The epidemic and riots of 1846 were 3
very sparsely treated, as if they formed a discredit to the county. 3

References to decline were few, though the significance of the later record was 3
unmistakable. After the Civil War all industrial life was confined to the Marsh 3
Refining Company, and the marketing of gold ingots formed the only remaining 3
bit of major commerce aside from the eternal fishing. That fishing paid less and 3
less as the price of the commodity fell and large-scale corporations offered 3
competition, but there was never a dearth of fish around Innsmouth Harbour. 3
Foreigners seldom settled there, and there was some discreetly veiled evidence 3
that a number of Poles and Portuguese who had tried it had been scattered in a 3
peculiarly drastic fashion. 3
3
Most interesting of all was a glancing reference to the strange jewelry vaguely 3
associated with Innsmouth. It had evidently impressed the whole countryside 3
more than a little, for mention was made of specimens in the museum of 3
Miskatonic University at Arkham, and in the display room of the Newburyport 3
Historical Society. The fragmentary descriptions of these things were bald and 3
prosaic, but they hinted to me an undercurrent of persistent strangeness. 3
Something about them seemed so odd and provocative that I could not put them 3
out of my mind, and despite the relative lateness of the hour I resolved to see the 3
local sample - said to be a large, queerly-proportioned thing evidently meant for 3
a tiara - if it could possibly be arranged. 3
3
The librarian gave me a note of introduction to the curator of the Society, a Miss 3
Anna Tilton, who lived nearby, and after a brief explanation that ancient 3
gentlewoman was kind enough to pilot me into the closed building, since the 3
hour was not outrageously late. The collection was a notable one indeed, but in 3
my present mood I had eyes for nothing but the bizarre object which glistened in 3
a corner cupboard under the electric lights. 3
3
It took no excessive sensitiveness to beauty to make me literally gasp at the 3
strange, unearthly splendour of the alien, opulent phantasy that rested there on a 3
purple velvet cushion. Even now I can hardly describe what I saw, though it was 3
clearly enough a sort of tiara, as the description had said. It was tall in front, and 3
with a very large and curiously irregular periphery, as if designed for a head of 3
almost freakishly elliptical outline. The material seemed to be predominantly 3
gold, though a weird lighter lustrousness hinted at some strange alloy with an 3
equally beautiful and scarcely identifiable metal. Its condition was almost 3
perfect, and one could have spent hours in studying the striking and puzzlingly 3
untraditional designs - some simply geometrical, and some plainly marine - 3
chased or moulded in high relief on its surface with a craftsmanship of incredible 3
skill and grace. 3
3
The longer I looked, the more the thing fascinated me; and in this fascination 3
there was a curiously disturbing element hardly to be classified or accounted for. 3
3
3
3
759 3
3
3
3
At first I decided that it was the queer other-worldly quality of the art which 3
made me uneasy. All other art objects I had ever seen either belonged to some 3
known racial or national stream, or else were consciously modernistic defiances 3
of every recognized stream. This tiara was neither. It clearly belonged to some 3
settled technique of infinite maturity and perfection, yet that technique was 3
utterly remote from any - Eastern or Western, ancient or modern - which I had 3
ever heard of or seen exemplified. It was as if the workmanship were that of 3
another planet. 3
3
However, I soon saw that my uneasiness had a second and perhaps equally 3
potent source residing in the pictorial and mathematical suggestion of the 3
strange designs. The patterns all hinted of remote secrets and unimaginable 3
abysses in time and space, and the monotonously aquatic nature of the reliefs 3
became almost sinister. Among these reliefs were fabulous monsters of abhorrent 3
grotesqueness and malignity - half ichthyic and half batrachian in suggestion - 3
which one could not dissociate from a certain haunting and uncomfortable sense 3
of pseudomemory, as if they called up some image from deep cells and tissues 3
whose retentive functions are wholly primal and awesomely ancestral. At times I 3
fancied that every contour of these blasphemous fish-frogs was over-flowing 3
with the ultimate quintessence of unknown and inhuman evil. 3
3
In odd contrast to the tiara's aspect was its brief and prosy history as related by 3
Miss Tilton. It had been pawned for a ridiculous sum at a shop in State Street in 3
1873, by a drunken Innsmouth man shortly afterward killed in a brawl. The 3
Society had acquired it directly from the pawnbroker, at once giving it a display 3
worthy of its quality. It was labeled as of probable East-Indian or Indochinese 3
provenance, though the attribution was frankly tentative. 3
3
Miss Tilton, comparing all possible hypotheses regarding its origin and its 3
presence in New England, was inclined to believe that it formed part of some 3
exotic pirate hoard discovered by old Captain Obed Marsh. This view was surely 3
not weakened by the insistent offers of purchase at a high price which the 3
Marshes began to make as soon as they knew of its presence, and which they 3
repeated to this day despite the Society's unvarying determination not to sell. 3
3
As the good lady shewed me out of the building she made it clear that the pirate 3
theory of the Marsh fortune was a popular one among the intelligent people of 3
the region. Her own attitude toward shadowed Innsmouth - which she never 3
seen - was one of disgust at a community slipping far down the cultural scale, 3
and she assured me that the rumours of devil-worship were partly justified by a 3
peculiar secret cult which had gained force there and engulfed all the orthodox 3
churches. 3
3
3
3
760 3
3
3
3
It was called, she said, "The Esoteric Order of Dagon", and was undoubtedly a 3
debased, quasi-pagan thing imported from the East a century before, at a time 3
when the Innsmouth fisheries seemed to be going barren. Its persistence among a 3
simple people was quite natural in view of the sudden and permanent return of 3
abundantly fine fishing, and it soon came to be the greatest influence in the town, 3
replacing Freemasonry altogether and taking up headquarters in the old Masonic 3
Hall on New Church Green. 3
3
All this, to the pious Miss Tilton, formed an excellent reason for shunning the 3
ancient town of decay and desolation; but to me it was merely a fresh incentive. 3
To my architectural and historical anticipations was now added an acute 3
anthropological zeal, and I could scarcely sleep in my small room at the "\" as 3
the night wore away. 3
3
II 3
3
Shortly before ten the next morning I stood with one small valise in front of 3
Hammond's Drug Store in old Market Square waiting for the Innsmouth bus. As 3
the hour for its arrival drew near I noticed a general drift of the loungers to other 3
places up the street, or to the Ideal Lunch across the square. Evidently the ticket- 3
agent had not exaggerated the dislike which local People bore toward Innsmouth 3
and its denizens. In a few moments a small motor-coach of extreme decrepitude 3
and dirty grey colour rattled down State Street, made a turn, and drew up at the 3
curb beside me. I felt immediately that it was the right one; a guess which the 3
half-illegible sign on the windshield - Arkham-Innsmouth-Newburyport - soon 3
verified. 3
3
There were only three passengers - dark, unkempt men of sullen visage and 3
somewhat youthful cast - and when the vehicle stopped they clumsily shambled 3
out and began walking up State Street in a silent, almost furtive fashion. The 3
driver also alighted, and I watched him as he went into the drug store to make 3
some purchase. This, I reflected, must be the Joe Sargent mentioned by the ticket- 3
agent; and even before I noticed any details there spread over me a wave of 3
spontaneous aversion which could be neither checked nor explained. It suddenly 3
struck me as very natural that the local people should not wish to ride on a bus 3
owned and driven by this man, or to visit any oftener than possible the habitat of 3
such a man and his kinsfolk. 3
3
When the driver came out of the store I looked at him more carefully and tried to 3
determine the source of my evil impression. He was a thin, stoop-shouldered 3
man not much under six feet tall, dressed in shabby blue civilian clothes and 3
wearing a frayed golf cap. His age was perhaps thirty-five, but the odd, deep 3
creases in the sides of his neck made him seem older when one did not study his 3
3
3
3
761 3
3
3
3
dull, expressionless face. He had a narrow head, bulging, watery-blue eyes that 3
seemed never to wink, a flat nose, a receding forehead and chin, and singularly 3
undeveloped ears. His long thick lip and coarse-pored, greyish cheeks seemed 3
almost beardless except for some sparse yellow hairs that straggled and curled in 3
irregular patches; and in places the surface seemed queerly irregular, as if 3
peeling from some cutaneous disease. His hands were large and heavily veined, 3
and had a very unusual greyish-blue tinge. The fingers were strikingly short in 3
proportion to the rest of the structure, and seemed to have a tendency to curl 3
closely into the huge palm. As he walked toward the bus I observed his 3
peculiarly shambling gait and saw that his feet were inordinately immense. The 3
more I studied them the more I wondered how he could buy any shoes to fit 3
them. 3
3
A certain greasiness about the fellow increased my dislike. He was evidently 3
given to working or lounging around the fish docks, and carried with him much 3
of their characteristic smell. Just what foreign blood was in him I could not even 3
guess. His oddities certainly did not look Asiatic, Polynesian, Levantine or 3
negroid, yet I could see why the people found him alien. I myself would have 3
thought of biological degeneration rather than alienage. 3
3
I was sorry when I saw there would be no other passengers on the bus. Somehow 3
I did not like the idea of riding alone with this driver. But as leaving time 3
obviously approached I conquered my qualms and followed the man aboard, 3
extending him a dollar bill and murmuring the single word "Innsmouth." He 3
looked curiously at me for a second as he returned forty cents change without 3
speaking. I took a seat far behind him, but on the same side of the bus, since I 3
wished to watch the shore during the journey. 3
3
At length the decrepit vehicle stared with a jerk, and rattled noisily past the old 3
brick buildings of State Street amidst a cloud of vapour from the exhaust. 3
Glancing at the people on the sidewalks, I thought I detected in them a curious 3
wish to avoid looking at the bus - or at least a wish to avoid seeming to look at it. 3
Then we turned to the left into High Street, where the going was smoother; 3
flying by stately old mansions of the early republic and still older colonial 3
farmhouses, passing the Lower Green and Parker River, and finally emerging 3
into a long, monotonous stretch of open shore country. 3
3
The day was warm and sunny, but the landscape of sand and sedge-grass, and 3
stunted shrubbery became more and desolate as we proceeded. Out the window 3
I could see the blue water and the sandy line of Plum Island, and we presently 3
drew very near the beach as our narrow road veered off from the main highway 3
to Rowley and Ipswich. There were no visible houses, and I could tell by the state 3
of the road that traffic was very light hereabouts. The weather-worn telephone 3
3
3
3
762 3
3
3
3
poles carried only two wires. Now and then we crossed crude wooden bridges 3
over tidal creeks that wound far inland and promoted the general isolation of the 3
region. 3
3
Once in a while I noticed dead stumps and crumbling foundation-walls above 3
the drifting sand, and recalled the old tradition quoted in one of the histories I 3
had read, that this was once a fertile and thickly-settled countryside. The change, 3
it was said, came simultaneously with the Innsmouth epidemic of 1846, and was 3
thought by simple folk to have a dark connection with hidden forces of evil. 3
Actually, it was caused by the unwise cutting of woodlands near the shore, 3
which robbed the soil of the best protection and opened the way for waves of 3
wind-blown sand. 3
3
At last we lost sight of Plum Island and saw the vast expanse of the open Atlantic 3
on our left. Our narrow course began to climb steeply, and I felt a singular sense 3
of disquiet in looking at the lonely crest ahead where the rutted road-way met 3
the sky. It was as if the bus were about to keep on in its ascent, leaving the sane 3
earth altogether and merging with the unknown arcana of upper air and 3
cryptical sky. The smell of the sea took on ominous implications, and the silent 3
driver's bent, rigid back and narrow head became more and more hateful. As I 3
looked at him I saw that the back of his head was almost as hairless as his face, 3
having only a few straggling yellow strands upon a grey scabrous surface. 3
3
Then we reached the crest and beheld the outspread valley beyond, where the 3
Manuxet joins the sea just north of the long line of cliffs that culminate in 3
Kingsport Head and veer off toward Cape Ann. On the far misty horizon I could 3
just make out the dizzy profile of the Head, topped by the queer ancient house of 3
which so many legends are told; but for the moment all my attention was 3
captured by the nearer panorama just below me. I had, I realized, come face to 3
face with rumour-shadowed Innsmouth. 3
3
It was a town of wide extent and dense construction, yet one with a portentous 3
dearth of visible life. From the tangle of chimney-pots scarcely a wisp of smoke 3
came, and the three tall steeples loomed stark and unpainted against the seaward 3
horizon. One of them was crumbling down at the top, and in that and another 3
there were only black gaping holes where clock-dials should have been. The vast 3
huddle of sagging gambrel roofs and peaked gables conveyed with offensive 3
clearness the idea of wormy decay, and as we approached along the now 3
descending road I could see that many roofs had wholly caved in. There were 3
some large square Georgian houses, too, with hipped roofs, cupolas, and railed 3
"widow's walks." These were mostly well back from the water, and one or two 3
seemed to be in moderately sound condition. Stretching inland from among 3
them I saw the rusted, grass-grown line of the abandoned railway, with leaning 3
3
3
3
763 3
3
3
3
telegraph-poles now devoid of wires, and the half-obscured lines of the old 3
carriage roads to Rowley and Ipswich. 3
3
The decay was worst close to the waterfront, though in its very midst I could spy 3
the white belfry of a fairly well preserved brick structure which looked like a 3
small factory. The harbour, long clogged with sand, was enclosed by an ancient 3
stone breakwater; on which I could begin to discern the minute forms of a few 3
seated fishermen, and at whose end were what looked like the foundations of a 3
bygone lighthouse. A sandy tongue had formed inside this barrier and upon it I 3
saw a few decrepit cabins, moored dories, and scattered lobster-pots. The only 3
deep water seemed to be where the river poured out past the belfried structure 3
and turned southward to join the ocean at the breakwater's end. 3
3
Here and there the ruins of wharves jutted out from the shore to end in 3
indeterminate rottenness, those farthest south seeming the most decayed. And 3
far out at sea, despite a high tide, I glimpsed a long, black line scarcely rising 3
above the water yet carrying a suggestion of odd latent malignancy. This, I knew, 3
must be Devil Reef. As I looked, a subtle, curious sense of beckoning seemed 3
superadded to the grim repulsion; and oddly enough, I found this overtone more 3
disturbing than the primary impression. 3
3
We met no one on the road, but presently began to pass deserted farms in 3
varying stages of ruin. Then I noticed a few inhabited houses with rags stuffed in 3
the broken windows and shells and dead fish lying about the littered yards. Once 3
or twice I saw listless-looking people working in barren gardens or digging 3
clams on the fishy-smelling beach below, and groups of dirty, simian-visaged 3
children playing around weed-grown doorsteps. Somehow these people seemed 3
more disquieting than the dismal buildings, for almost every one had certain 3
peculiarities of face and motions which I instinctively disliked without being able 3
to define or comprehend them. For a second I thought this typical physique 3
suggested some picture I had seen, perhaps in a book, under circumstances of 3
particular horror or melancholy; but this pseudo-recollection passed very 3
quickly. 3
3
As the bus reached a lower level I began to catch the steady note of a waterfall 3
through the unnatural stillness. The leaning, unpainted houses grew thicker, 3
lined both sides of the road, and displayed more urban tendencies than did those 3
we were leaving behind. The panorama ahead had contracted to a street scene, 3
and in spots I could see where a cobblestone pavement and stretches of brick 3
sidewalk had formerly existed. All the houses were apparently deserted, and 3
there were occasional gaps where tumbledown chimneys and cellar walls told of 3
buildings that had collapsed. Pervading everything was the most nauseous fishy 3
odour imaginable. 3
3
3
3
764 3
3
3
3
Soon cross streets and junctions began to appear; those on the left leading to 3
shoreward realms of unpaved squalor and decay, while those on the right 3
shewed vistas of departed grandeur. So far I had seen no people in the town, but 3
there now came signs of a sparse habitation - curtained windows here and there, 3
and an occasional battered motorcar at the curb. Pavement and sidewalks were 3
increasingly well-defined, and though most of the houses were quite old - wood 3
and brick structures of the early 19th century - they were obviously kept fit for 3
habitation. As an amateur antiquarian I almost lost my olfactory disgust and my 3
feeling of menace and repulsion amidst this rich, unaltered survival from the 3
past. 3
3
But I was not to reach my destination without one very strong impression of 3
poignantly disagreeable quality. The bus had come to a sort of open concourse or 3
radial point with churches on two sides and the bedraggled remains of a circular 3
green in the centre, and I was looking at a large pillared hall on the right-hand 3
junction ahead. The structure's once white paint was now gray and peeling and 3
the black and gold sign on the pediment was so faded that I could only with 3
difficulty make out the words "Esoteric Order of Dagon". This, then was the 3
former Masonic Hall now given over to a degraded cult. As I strained to 3
decipher this inscription my notice was distracted by the raucous tones of a 3
cracked bell across the street, and I quickly turned to look out the window on my 3
side of the coach. 3
3
The sound came from a squat stone church of manifestly later date than most of 3
the houses, built in a clumsy Gothic fashion and having a disproportionately 3
high basement with shuttered windows. Though the hands of its clock were 3
missing on the side I glimpsed, I knew that those hoarse strokes were tolling the 3
hour of eleven. Then suddenly all thoughts of time were blotted out by an 3
onrushing image of sharp intensity and unaccountable horror which had seized 3
me before I knew what it really was. The door of the church basement was open, 3
revealing a rectangle of blackness inside. And as I looked, a certain object crossed 3
or seemed to cross that dark rectangle; burning into my brain a momentary 3
conception of nightmare which was all the more maddening because analysis 3
could not shew a single nightmarish quality in it. 3
3
It was a living object - the first except the driver that I had seen since entering the 3
compact part of the town - and had I been in a steadier mood I would have 3
found nothing whatever of terror in it. Clearly, as I realised a moment later, it 3
was the pastor; clad in some peculiar vestments doubtless introduced since the 3
Order of Dagon had modified the ritual of the local churches. The thing which 3
had probably caught my first subconscious glance and supplied the touch of 3
bizarre horror was the tall tiara he wore; an almost exact duplicate of the one 3
Miss Tilton had shown me the previous evening. This, acting on my imagination. 3
3
3
3
765 3
3
3
3
had supplied namelessly sinister qualities to the indeterminate face and robed, 3
shambling form beneath it. There was not, I soon decided, any reason why I 3
should have felt that shuddering touch of evil pseudo-memory. Was it not 3
natural that a local mystery cult should adopt among its regimentals an unique 3
type of head-dress made familiar to the community in some strange way - 3
perhaps as treasure-trove? 3
3
A very thin sprinkling of repellent-looking youngish people now became visible 3
on the sidewalks - lone individuals, and silent knots of two or three. The lower 3
floors of the crumbling houses sometimes harboured small shops with dingy 3
signs, and I noticed a parked truck or two as we rattled along. The sound of 3
waterfalls became more and more distinct, and presently I saw a fairly deep 3
river-gorge ahead, spanned by a wide, iron-railed highway bridge beyond which 3
a large square opened out. As we clanked over the bridge I looked out on both 3
sides and observed some factory buildings on the edge of the grassy bluff or part 3
way down. The water far below was very abundant, and I could see two 3
vigorous sets of falls upstream on my right and at least one downstream on my 3
left. From this point the noise was quite deafening. Then we rolled into the large 3
semicircular square across the river and drew up on the right-hand side in front 3
of a tall, cupola crowned building with remnants of yellow paint and with a half- 3
effaced sign proclaiming it to be the Gilman House. 3
3
I was glad to get out of that bus, and at once proceeded to check my valise in the 3
shabby hotel lobby. There was only one person in sight - an elderly man without 3
what I had come to call the "Innsmouth look" - and I decided not to ask him any 3
of the questions which bothered me; remembering that odd things had been 3
noticed in this hotel. Instead, I strolled out on the square, from which the bus had 3
already gone, and studied the scene minutely and appraisingly. 3
3
One side of the cobblestoned open space was the straight line of the river; the 3
other was a semicircle of slant-roofed brick buildings of about the 1800 period, 3
from which several streets radiated away to the southeast, south, and southwest. 3
Lamps were depressingly few and small - all low-powered incandescents - and I 3
was glad that my plans called for departure before dark, even though I knew the 3
moon would be bright. The buildings were all in fair condition, and included 3
perhaps a dozen shops in current operation; of which one was a grocery of the 3
First National chain, others a dismal restaurant, a drug store, and a wholesale 3
fish-dealer's office, and still another, at the eastward extremity of the square near 3
the river an office of the town's only industry - the Marsh Refining Company. 3
There were perhaps ten people visible, and four or five automobiles and motor 3
trucks stood scattered about. I did not need to be told that this was the civic 3
centre of Innsmouth. Eastward I could catch blue glimpses of the harbour, 3
against which rose the decaying remains of three once beautiful Georgian 3
3
3
3
766 3
3
3
3
steeples. And toward the shore on the opposite bank of the river I saw the white 3
belfry surmounting what I took to be the Marsh refinery. 3
3
For some reason or other I chose to make my first inquiries at the chain grocery, 3
whose personnel was not likely to be native to Innsmouth. I found a solitary boy 3
of about seventeen in charge, and was pleased to note the brightness and 3
affability which promised cheerful information. He seemed exceptionally eager 3
to talk, and I soon gathered that he did not like the place, its fishy smell, or its 3
furtive people. A word with any outsider was a relief to him. He hailed from 3
Arkham, boarded with a family who came from Ipswich, and went back 3
whenever he got a moment off. His family did not like him to work in 3
Innsmouth, but the chain had transferred him there and he did not wish to give 3
up his job. 3
3
There was, he said, no public library or chamber of commerce in Innsmouth, but 3
I could probably find my way about. The street I had come down was Federal. 3
West of that were the fine old residence streets - Broad, Washington, Lafayette, 3
and Adams - and east of it were the shoreward slums. It was in these slums - 3
along Main Street - that I would find the old Georgian churches, but they were 3
all long abandoned. It would be well not to make oneself too conspicuous in such 3
neighbourhoods - especially north of the river since the people were sullen and 3
hostile. Some strangers had even disappeared. 3
3
Certain spots were almost forbidden territory, as he had learned at considerable 3
cost. One must not, for example, linger much around the Marsh refinery, or 3
around any of the still used churches, or around the pillared Order of Dagon 3
Hall at New Church Green. Those churches were very odd - all violently 3
disavowed by their respective denominations elsewhere, and apparently using 3
the queerest kind of ceremonials and clerical vestments. Their creeds were 3
heterodox and mysterious, involving hints of certain marvelous transformations 3
leading to bodily immorality - of a sort - on this earth. The youth's own pastor - 3
Dr. Wallace of Asbury M. E. Church in Arkham - had gravely urged him not to 3
join any church in Innsmouth. 3
3
As for the Innsmouth people - the youth hardly knew what to make of them. 3
They were as furtive and seldom seen as animals that live in burrows, and one 3
could hardly imagine how they passed the time apart from their desultory 3
fishing. Perhaps - judging from the quantities of bootleg liquor they consumed - 3
they lay for most of the daylight hours in an alcoholic stupor. They seemed 3
sullenly banded together in some sort of fellowship and understanding - 3
despising the world as if they had access to other and preferable spheres of 3
entity. Their appearance - especially those staring, unwinking eyes which one 3
never saw shut - was certainly shocking enough; and their voices were 3
3
3
3
767 3
3
3
3
disgusting. It was awful to hear them chanting in their churches at night, and 3
especially during their main festivals or revivals, which fell twice a year on April 3
30th and October 31st. 3
3
They were very fond of the water, and swam a great deal in both river and 3
harbour. Swimming races out to Devil Reef were very common, and everyone in 3
sight seemed well able to share in this arduous sport. When one came to think of 3
it, it was generally only rather young people who were seen about in public, and 3
of these the oldest were apt to be the most tainted-looking. When exceptions did 3
occur, they were mostly persons with no trace of aberrancy, like the old clerk at 3
the hotel. One wondered what became of the bulk of the older folk, and whether 3
the "Innsmouth look" were not a strange and insidious disease-phenomenon 3
which increased its hold as years advanced. 3
3
Only a very rare affliction, of course, could bring about such vast and radical 3
anatomical changes in a single individual after maturity - changes invoking 3
osseous factors as basic as the shape of the skull - but then, even this aspect was 3
no more baffling and unheard-of than the visible features of the malady as a 3
whole. It would be hard, the youth implied, to form any real conclusions 3
regarding such a matter; since one never came to know the natives personally no 3
matter how long one might live in Innsmouth. 3
3
The youth was certain that many specimens even worse than the worst visible 3
ones were kept locked indoors in some places. People sometimes heard the 3
queerest kind of sounds. The tottering waterfront hovels north of the river were 3
reputedly connected by hidden tunnels, being thus a veritable warren of unseen 3
abnormalities. What kind of foreign blood - if any - these beings had, it was 3
impossible to tell. They sometimes kept certain especially repulsive characters 3
out of sight when government and others from the outside world came to town. 3
3
It would be of no use, my informant said, to ask the natives anything about the 3
place. The only one who would talk was a very aged but normal looking man 3
who lived at the poorhouse on the north rim of the town and spent his time 3
walking about or lounging around the fire station. This hoary character, Zadok 3
Allen, was 96 years old and somewhat touched in the head, besides being the 3
town drunkard. He was a strange, furtive creature who constantly looked over 3
his shoulder as if afraid of something, and when sober could not be persuaded to 3
talk at all with strangers. He was, however, unable to resist any offer of his 3
favorite poison; and once drunk would furnish the most astonishing fragments 3
of whispered reminiscence. 3
3
After all, though, little useful data could be gained from him; since his stories 3
were all insane, incomplete hints of impossible marvels and horrors which could 3
3
3
3
768 3
3
3
3
have no source save in his own disordered fancy. Nobody ever beheved him, but 3
the natives did not hke him to drink and talk with strangers; and it was not 3
always safe to be seen questioning him. It was probably from him that some of 3
the wildest popular whispers and delusions were derived. 3
3
Several non-native residents had reported monstrous glimpses from time to time, 3
but between old Zadok's tales and the malformed inhabitants it was no wonder 3
such illusions were current. None of the non-natives ever stayed out late at night, 3
there being a widespread impression that it was not wise to do so. Besides, the 3
streets were loathsomely dark. 3
3
As for business - the abundance of fish was certainly almost uncanny, but the 3
natives were taking less and less advantage of it. Moreover, prices were falling 3
and competition was growing. Of course the town's real business was the 3
refinery, whose commercial office was on the square only a few doors east of 3
where we stood. Old Man Marsh was never seen, but sometimes went to the 3
works in a closed, curtained car. 3
3
There were all sorts of rumors about how Marsh had come to look. He had once 3
been a great dandy; and people said he still wore the frock-coated finery of the 3
Edwardian age curiously adapted to certain deformities. His son had formerly 3
conducted the office in the square, but latterly they had been keeping out of sight 3
a good deal and leaving the brunt of affairs to the younger generation. The sons 3
and their sisters had come to look very queer, especially the elder ones; and it 3
was said that their health was failing. 3
3
One of the Marsh daughters was a repellent, reptilian-looking woman who wore 3
an excess of weird jewellery clearly of the same exotic tradition as that to which 3
the strange tiara belonged. My informant had noticed it many times, and had 3
heard it spoken of as coming from some secret hoard, either of pirates or of 3
demons. The clergymen - or priests, or whatever they were called nowadays - 3
also wore this kind of ornament as a headdress; but one seldom caught glimpses 3
of them. Other specimens the youth had not seen, though many were rumoured 3
to exist around Innsmouth. 3
3
The Marshes, together with the other three gently bred families of the town - the 3
Waites, the Gilmans, and the Eliots - were all very retiring. They lived in 3
immense houses along Washington Street, and several were reputed to harbour 3
in concealment certain living kinsfolk whose personal aspect forbade public 3
view, and whose deaths had been reported and recorded. 3
3
Warning me that many of the street signs were down, the youth drew for my 3
benefit a rough but ample and painstaking sketch map of the town's salient 3
3
3
3

3
features. After a moment's study I felt sure that it would be of great help, and 3
pocketed it with profuse thanks. Disliking the dinginess of the single restaurant I 3
had seen, I bought a fair supply of cheese crackers and ginger wafers to serve as 3
a lunch later on. My program, I decided, would be to thread the principal streets, 3
talk with any non-natives I might encounter, and catch the eight o'clock coach for 3
Arkham. The town, I could see, formed a significant and exaggerated example of 3
communal decay; but being no sociologist I would limit my serious observations 3
to the field of architecture. 3
3
Thus I began my systematic though half-bewildered tour of Innsmouth's narrow, 3
shadow-blighted ways. Crossing the bridge and turning toward the roar of the 3
lower falls, I passed close to the Marsh refinery, which seemed to be oddly free 3
from the noise of industry. The building stood on the steep river bluff near a 3
bridge and an open confluence of streets which I took to be the earliest civic 3
center, displaced after the Revolution by the present Town Square. 3
3
Re-crossing the gorge on the Main Street bridge, I struck a region of utter 3
desertion which somehow made me shudder. Collapsing huddles of gambrel 3
roofs formed a jagged and fantastic skyline, above which rose the ghoulish, 3
decapitated steeple of an ancient church. Some houses along Main Street were 3
tenanted, but most were tightly boarded up. Down unpaved side streets I saw 3
the black, gaping windows of deserted hovels, many of which leaned at perilous 3
and incredible angles through the sinking of part of the foundations. Those 3
windows stared so spectrally that it took courage to turn eastward toward the 3
waterfront. Certainly, the terror of a deserted house swells in geometrical rather 3
than arithmetical progression as houses multiply to form a city of stark 3
desolation. The sight of such endless avenues of fishy-eyed vacancy and death, 3
and the thought of such linked infinities of black, brooding compartments given 3
over to cob-webs and memories and the conqueror worm, start up vestigial fears 3
and aversions that not even the stoutest philosophy can disperse. 3
3
Fish Street was as deserted as Main, though it differed in having many brick and 3
stone warehouses still in excellent shape. Water Street was almost its duplicate, 3
save that there were great seaward gaps where wharves had been. Not a living 3
thing did I see except for the scattered fishermen on the distant break-water, and 3
not a sound did I hear save the lapping of the harbour tides and the roar of the 3
falls in the Manuxet. The town was getting more and more on my nerves, and I 3
looked behind me furtively as I picked my way back over the tottering Water 3
Street bridge. The Fish Street bridge, according to the sketch, was in ruins. 3
3
North of the river there were traces of squalid life - active fish-packing houses in 3
Water Street, smoking chimneys and patched roofs here and there, occasional 3
sounds from indeterminate sources, and infrequent shambling forms in the 3
3
3
3
770 3
3
3
3
dismal streets and unpaved lanes - but I seemed to find this even more 3
oppressive than the southerly desertion. For one thing, the people were more 3
hideous and abnormal than those near the centre of the town; so that I was 3
several times evilly reminded of something utterly fantastic which I could not 3
quite place. Undoubtedly the alien strain in the Innsmouth folk was stronger 3
here than farther inland - unless, indeed, the "Innsmouth look" were a disease 3
rather than a blood stain, in which case this district might be held to harbour the 3
more advanced cases. 3
3
One detail that annoyed me was the distribution of the few faint sounds I heard. 3
They ought naturally to have come wholly from the visibly inhabited houses, yet 3
in reality were often strongest inside the most rigidly boarded-up facades. There 3
were creakings, scurryings, and hoarse doubtful noises; and I thought 3
uncomfortably about the hidden tunnels suggested by the grocery boy. Suddenly 3
I found myself wondering what the voices of those denizens would be like. I had 3
heard no speech so far in this quarter, and was unaccountably anxious not to do 3
so. 3
3
Pausing only long enough to look at two fine but ruinous old churches at Main 3
and Church Streets, I hastened out of that vile waterfront slum. My next logical 3
goal was New Church Green, but somehow or other I could not bear to repass 3
the church in whose basement I had glimpsed the inexplicably frightening form 3
of that strangely diademmed priest or pastor. Besides, the grocery youth had told 3
me that churches, as well as the Order of Dagon Hall, were not advisable 3
neighbourhoods for strangers. 3
3
Accordingly I kept north along Main to Martin, then turning inland, crossing 3
Federal Street safely north of the Green, and entering the decayed patrician 3
neighbourhood of northern Broad, Washington, Lafayette, and Adams Streets. 3
Though these stately old avenues were ill-surfaced and unkempt, their elm- 3
shaded dignity had not entirely departed. Mansion after mansion claimed my 3
gaze, most of them decrepit and boarded up amidst neglected grounds, but one 3
or two in each street shewing signs of occupancy. In Washington Street there was 3
a row of four or five in excellent repair and with finely-tended lawns and 3
gardens. The most sumptuous of these - with wide terraced parterres extending 3
back the whole way to Lafayette Street - 1 took to be the home of Old Man Marsh, 3
the afflicted refinery owner. 3
3
In all these streets no living thing was visible, and I wondered at the complete 3
absence of cats and dogs from Innsmouth. Another thing which puzzled and 3
disturbed me, even in some of the best-preserved mansions, was the tightly 3
shuttered condition of many third-story and attic windows. Furtiveness and 3
secretiveness seemed universal in this hushed city of alienage and death, and I 3
3
3
3
771 3
3
3
3
could not escape the sensation of being watched from ambush on every hand by 3
sly, staring eyes that never shut. 3
3
I shivered as the cracked stroke of three sounded from a belfry on my left. Too 3
well did I recall the squat church from which those notes came. Following 3
Washington street toward the river, I now faced a new zone of former industry 3
and commerce; noting the ruins of a factory ahead, and seeing others, with the 3
traces of an old railway station and covered railway bridge beyond, up the gorge 3
on my right. 3
3
The uncertain bridge now before me was posted with a warning sign, but I took 3
the risk and crossed again to the south bank where traces of life reappeared. 3
Furtive, shambling creatures stared cryptically in my direction, and more normal 3
faces eyed me coldly and curiously. Innsmouth was rapidly becoming 3
intolerable, and I turned down Paine Street toward the Square in the hope of 3
getting some vehicle to take me to Arkham before the still-distant starting-time 3
of that sinister bus. 3
3
It was then that I saw the tumbledown fire station on my left, and noticed the red 3
faced, bushy-bearded, watery eyed old man in nondescript rags who sat on a 3
bench in front of it talking with a pair of unkempt but not abnormal looking 3
firemen. This, of course, must be Zadok Allen, the half-crazed, liquorish 3
nonagenarian whose tales of old Innsmouth and its shadow were so hideous and 3
incredible. 3
3
Ill 3
3
It must have been some imp of the perverse - or some sardonic pull from dark, 3
hidden sources - which made me change my plans as I did. I had long before 3
resolved to limit my observations to architecture alone, and I was even then 3
hurrying toward the Square in an effort to get quick transportation out of this 3
festering city of death and decay; but the sight of old Zadok Allen set up new 3
currents in my mind and made me slacken my pace uncertainly. 3
3
I had been assured that the old man could do nothing but hint at wild, disjointed, 3
and incredible legends, and I had been warned that the natives made it unsafe to 3
be seen talking with him; yet the thought of this aged witness to the town's 3
decay, with memories going back to the early days of ships and factories, was a 3
lure that no amount of reason could make me resist. After all, the strangest and 3
maddest of myths are often merely symbols or allegories based upon truth - and 3
old Zadok must have seen everything which went on around Innsmouth for the 3
last ninety years. Curiosity flared up beyond sense and caution, and in my 3
youthful egotism I fancied I might be able to sift a nucleus of real history from 3
3
3
3
772 3
3
3
3
the confused, extravagant outpouring I would probably extract with the aid of 3
raw whiskey. 3
3
I knew that I could not accost him then and there, for the firemen would surely 3
notice and object. Instead, I reflected, I would prepare by getting some bootleg 3
liquor at a place where the grocery boy had told me it was plentiful. Then I 3
would loaf near the fire station in apparent casualness, and fall in with old 3
Zadok after he had started on one of his frequent rambles. The youth had said 3
that he was very restless, seldom sitting around the station for more than an hour 3
or two at a time. 3
3
A quart bottle of whiskey was easily, though not cheaply, obtained in the rear of 3
a dingy variety-store just off the Square in Eliot Street. The dirty -looking fellow 3
who waited on me had a touch of the staring "Innsmouth look", but was quite 3
civil in his way; being perhaps used to the custom of such convivial strangers - 3
truckmen, gold-buyers, and the like - as were occasionally in town. 3
3
Reentering the Square I saw that luck was with me; for - shuffling out of Paine 3
street around the corner of the Gilman House - I glimpsed nothing less than the 3
tall, lean, tattered form of old Zadok Allen himself. In accordance with my plan, I 3
attracted his attention by brandishing my newly-purchased bottle: and soon 3
realised that he had begun to shuffle wistfully after me as I turned into Waite 3
Street on my way to the most deserted region I could think of. 3
3
I was steering my course by the map the grocery boy had prepared, and was 3
aiming for the wholly abandoned stretch of southern waterfront which I had 3
previously visited. The only people in sight there had been the fishermen on the 3
distant breakwater; and by going a few squares south I could get beyond the 3
range of these, finding a pair of seats on some abandoned wharf and being free 3
to question old Zadok unobserved for an indefinite time. Before I reached Main 3
Street I could hear a faint and wheezy "Hey, Mister!" behind me and I presently 3
allowed the old man to catch up and take copious pulls from the quart bottle. 3
3
I began putting out feelers as we walked amidst the omnipresent desolation and 3
crazily tilted ruins, but found that the aged tongue did not loosen as quickly as I 3
had expected. At length I saw a grass-grown opening toward the sea between 3
crumbling brick walls, with the weedy length of an earth-and-masonry wharf 3
projecting beyond. Piles of moss-covered stones near the water promised 3
tolerable seats, and the scene was sheltered from all possible view by a ruined 3
warehouse on the north. Here, I thought was the ideal place for a long secret 3
colloquy; so I guided my companion down the lane and picked out spots to sit in 3
among the mossy stones. The air of death and desertion was ghoulish, and the 3
smell of fish almost insufferable; but I was resolved to let nothing deter me. 3
3
3
3
773 3
3
3
3
About four hours remained for conversation if I were to catch the eight o'clock 3
coach for Arkham, and I began to dole out more liquor to the ancient tippler; 3
meanwhile eating my own frugal lunch. In my donations I was careful not to 3
overshoot the mark, for I did not wish Zadok's vinous garrulousness to pass into 3
a stupor. After an hour his furtive taciturnity shewed signs of disappearing, but 3
much to my disappointment he still sidetracked my questions about Innsmouth 3
and its shadow-haunted past. He would babble of current topics, revealing a 3
wide acquaintance with newspapers and a great tendency to philosophise in a 3
sententious village fashion. 3
3
Toward the end of the second hour I feared my quart of whiskey would not be 3
enough to produce results, and was wondering whether I had better leave old 3
Zadok and go back for more. Just then, however, chance made the opening 3
which my questions had been unable to make; and the wheezing ancient's 3
rambling took a turn that caused me to lean forward and listen alertly. My back 3
was toward the fishy-smelling sea, but he was facing it and something or other 3
had caused his wandering gaze to light on the low, distant line of Devil Reef, 3
then showing plainly and almost fascinatingly above the waves. The sight 3
seemed to displease him, for he began a series of weak curses which ended in a 3
confidential whisper and a knowing leer. He bent toward me, took hold of my 3
coat lapel, and hissed out some hints that could not be mistaken, 3
3
"Thar's whar it all begun - that cursed place of all wickedness whar the deep 3
water starts. Gate o' hell - sheer drop daown to a bottom no saoundin'-line kin 3
tech. or Cap'n Obed done it - him that faound aout more'n was good fer him in 3
the Saouth Sea islands. 3
3
"Everybody was in a bad way them days. Trade fallin' off, mills losin' business - 3
even the new ones - an' the best of our menfolks kilt aprivateerin' in the War of 3
1812 or lost with the Elizy brig an' the Ranger scow - both on 'em Gilman 3
venters. Obed Marsh he had three ships afloat - brigantine Columby, brig Hefty, 3
an' barque Sumatry Queen. He was the only one as kep' on with the East-Injy an' 3
Pacific trade, though Esdras Martin's barkentine Malay Bride made a venter as 3
late as twenty-eight. 3
3
"Never was nobody like Cap'n Obed - old limb o' Satan! Heh, heh! I kin mind 3
him a-tellin' abaout furren parts, an' callin' all the folks stupid for goin' to 3
Christian meetin' an' bearin' their burdns meek an' lowly. Says they'd orter git 3
better gods like some o' the folks in the Injies - gods as ud bring 'em good fishin' 3
in return for their sacrifices, an' ud reely answer folks's prayers. 3
3
"Matt Eliot his fust mate, talked a lot too, only he was again' folks's doin' any 3
heathen things. Told abaout an island east of Othaheite whar they was a lot o' 3
3
3
3
774 3
3
3
3
stone ruins older'n anybody knew anying abaout, kind o' like them on Ponape, 3
in the Carohnes, but with carven's of faces that looked like the big statues on 3
Easter Island. Thar was a little volcanic island near thar, too, whar they was other 3
ruins with diff'rent carvin' - ruins all wore away like they'd ben under the sea 3
onct, an' with picters of awful monsters all over 'em. 3
3
"Wal, Sir, Matt he says the natives anound thar had all the fish they cud ketch, 3
an' sported bracelets an' armlets an' head rigs made aout o' a queer kind o' gold 3
an' covered with picters o' monsters jest like the ones carved over the ruins on 3
the little island - sorter fish-like frogs or froglike fishes that was drawed in all 3
kinds o' positions likes they was human bein's. Nobody cud get aout o' them 3
whar they got all the stuff, an' all the other natives wondered haow they 3
managed to find fish in plenty even when the very next island had lean pickin's. 3
Matt he got to wonderon' too an' so did Cap'n Obed. Obed he notices, besides, 3
that lots of the hn'some young folks ud drop aout o' sight fer good from year to 3
year, an' that they wan't many old folks around. Also, he thinks some of the folks 3
looked dinned queer even for Kanakys. 3
3
"It took Obed to git the truth aout o' them heathen. I dun't know haow he done 3
it, but be begun by tradin' fer the gold-like things they wore. Ast 'em whar they 3
come from, an' ef they cud git more, an' finally wormed the story aout o' the old 3
chief — Walakea, they called him. Nobody but Obed ud ever a believed the old 3
yeller devil, but the Cap'n cud read folks like they was books. Heh, heh! Nobody 3
never believes me naow when I tell 'em, an' I dun't s'pose you will, young feller - 3
though come to look at ye, ye hev kind o' got them sharp-readin' eyes like Obed 3
had." 3
3
The old man's whisper grew fainter, and I found myself shuddering at the 3
terrible and sincere portentousness of his intonation, even though I knew his tale 3
could be nothing but drunken phantasy. 3
3
"Wal, Sir, Obed he 'lart that they's things on this arth as most folks never heerd 3
about - an' wouldn't believe ef they did hear. It seems these Kanakys was 3
sacrificin' heaps o' their young men an' maidens to some kind o' god-things that 3
lived under the sea, an' gittin' all kinds o' favour in return. They met the things 3
on the little islet with the queer ruins, an' it seems them awful picters o' frog-fish 3
monsters was supposed to be picters o' these things. Mebbe they was the kind o' 3
critters as got all the mermaid stories an' sech started. 3
3
"They had all kinds a' cities on the sea-bottom, an' this island was heaved up 3
from thar. Seem they was some of the things alive in the stone buildin's when the 3
island come up sudden to the surface. That's how the Kanakys got wind they 3
3
3
3
nb 3
3
3
3
was daown thar. Made sign-talk as soon as they got over bein' skeert, an' pieced 3
up a bargain afore long. 3
3
"Them things liked human sacrifices. Had had 'em ages afore, but lost track o' 3
the upper world after a time. What they done to the victims it ain't fer me to say, 3
an' I guess Obed was'n't none too sharp abaout askin'. But it was all right with 3
the heathens, because they'd ben havin' a hard time an' was desp'rate abaout 3
everything. They give a sarten number o' young folks to the sea-things twice 3
every year - May-Eve an' Hallawe'en - reg'lar as cud be. Also give some a' the 3
carved knick-knacks they made. What the things agreed to give in return was 3
plenty a' fish - they druv 'em in from all over the sea - an' a few gold like things 3
naow an' then. 3
3
"Wal, as I says, the natives met the things on the little volcanic islet - goin' thar in 3
canoes with the sacrifices et cet'ry, and bringin' back any of the gold-like jools as 3
was comin' to 'em. At fust the things didn't never go onto the main island, but 3
arter a time they come to want to. Seems they hankered arter mixin' with the 3
folks, an' havin' j'int ceremonies on the big days - May-Eve an' Hallowe'en. Ye 3
see, they was able to live both in ant aout o' water - what they call amphibians, I 3
guess. The Kanakys told 'em as haow folks from the other islands might wanta 3
wipe 'an out if they got wind o' their bein' thar, but they says they dun't keer 3
much, because they cud wipe aout the hull brood o' humans ef they was willin' 3
to bother - that is, any as didn't be, sarten signs sech as was used onct by the lost 3
Old Ones, whoever they was. But not wantin' to bother, they'd lay low when 3
anybody visited the island. 3
3
"When it come to matin' with them toad-lookin' fishes, the Kanakys kind o' 3
balked, but finally they larnt something as put a new face on the matter. Seems 3
that human folks has got a kind a' relation to sech water-beasts - that everything 3
alive come aout o' the water onct an' only needs a little change to go back agin. 3
Them things told the Kanakys that ef they mixed bloods there'd be children as 3
ud look human at fust, but later turn more'n more like the things, till finally 3
they'd take to the water an' jine the main lot o' things daown har. An' this is the 3
important part, young feller - them as turned into fish things an' went into the 3
water wouldn't never die. Them things never died excep' they was kilt violent. 3
3
"Wal, Sir, it seems by the time Obed knowed them islanders they was all full o' 3
fish blood from them deep water things. When they got old an' begun to shew it, 3
they was kep' hid until they felt like takin' to the water an' quittin' the place. 3
Some was more teched than others, an' some never did change quite enough to 3
take to the water; but mosily they turned out jest the way them things said. Them 3
as was born more like the things changed arly, but them as was nearly human 3
sometimes stayed on the island till they was past seventy, though they'd usually 3
3
3
3
776 3
3
3
3
go daown under for trial trips afore that. Folks as had took to the water gen'rally 3
come back a good deal to visit, so's a man ud often be a'talkin' to his own five- 3
times-great-grandfather who'd left the dry land a couple o' hundred years or so 3
afore. 3
3
"Everybody got aout o' the idee o' dyin' - excep' in canoe wars with the other 3
islanders, or as sacrifices to the sea-gods daown below, or from snakebite or 3
plague or sharp gallopin' ailments or somethin' afore they cud take to the water - 3
but simply looked forrad to a kind o' change that wa'n't a bit horrible artet a 3
while. They thought what they'd got was well wuth all they'd had to give up - 3
an' I guess Obed kind o' come to think the same hisself when he'd chewed over 3
old Walakea's story a bit. Walakea, though, was one of the few as hadn't got 3
none of the fish blood - bein' of a royal line that intermarried with royal lines on 3
other islands. 3
3
"Walakea he shewed Obed a lot o' rites an' incantations as had to do with the sea 3
things, an' let him see some o' the folks in the village as had changed a lot from 3
human shape. Somehaow or other, though, he never would let him see one of the 3
reg'lar things from right aout o' the water. In the end he give him a funny kind o' 3
thingumajig made aout o' lead or something, that he said ud bring up the fish 3
things from any place in the water whar they might be a nest o' 'em. The idee 3
was to drop it daown with the right kind o' prayers an' sech. Walakea allowed as 3
the things was scattered all over the world, so's anybody that looked abaout cud 3
find a nest an' bring 'em up ef they was wanted. 3
3
"Matt he didn't like this business at all, an' wanted Obed shud keep away from 3
the island; but the Cap'n was sharp fer gain, an' faound he cud get them gold- 3
like things so cheap it ud pay him to make a specialty of them. Things went on 3
that way for years an' Obed got enough o' that gold-like stuff to make him start 3
the refinery in Waite's old run-daown fuUin' mill. He didn't dass sell the pieces 3
like they was, for folks ud be all the time askin' questions. All the same his crews 3
ud get a piece an' dispose of it naow and then, even though they was swore to 3
keep quiet; an' he let his women-folks wear some o' the pieces as was more 3
human-like than most. 3
3
"Well, come abaout thutty-eight - when I was seven year' old - Obed he faound 3
the island people all wiped aout between v'yages. Seems the other islanders had 3
got wind o' what was goin' on, and had took matters into their own hands. 3
S'pose they must a had, after all, them old magic signs as the sea things says was 3
the only things they was afeard of. No tellin' what any o' them Kanakys will 3
chance to git a holt of when the sea-bottom throws up some island with ruins 3
older'n the deluge. Pious cusses, these was - they didn't leave nothin' standin' on 3
either the main island or the little volcanic islet excep' what parts of the ruins 3
3
3
3
m 3
3
3
3
was too big to knock daown. In some places they was little stones strewed 3
abaout - like charms - with somethin' on 'em like what ye call a swastika 3
naowadays. Prob'ly them was the Old Ones' signs. Folks all wiped aout no trace 3
o' no gold-like things an' none the nearby Kanakys ud breathe a word abaout the 3
matter. Wouldn't even admit they'd ever ben any people on that island. 3
3
"That naturally hit Obed pretty hard, seein' as his normal trade was doin' very 3
poor. It hit the whole of Innsmouth, too, because in seafarint days what profited 3
the master of a ship gen'Uy profited the crew proportionate. Most of the folks 3
araound the taown took the hard times kind o' sheep-like an' resigned, but they 3
was in bad shape because the fishin' was peterin' aout an' the mills wan't doin' 3
none too well. 3
3
"Then's the time Obed he begun a-cursin' at the folks fer bein' dull sheep an' 3
prayin' to a Christian heaven as didn't help 'em none. He told 'em he'd knowed 3
o' folks as prayed to gods that give somethin' ye reely need, an' says ef a good 3
bunch o' men ud stand by him, he cud mebbe get a holt o' sarten paowers as ud 3
bring plenty o' fish an' quite a bit of gold. 0' course them as sarved on the 3
Sumatry Queen, an' seed the island knowed what he meant, an' wa'n't none too 3
anxious to get clost to sea-things like they'd heard tell on, but them as didn't 3
know what 'twas all abaout got kind o' swayed by what Obed had to say, and 3
begun to ast him what he cud do to sit 'em on the way to the faith as ud bring 3
'em results." 3
3
Here the old man faltered, mumbled, and lapsed into a moody and apprehensive 3
silence; glancing nervously over his shoulder and then turning back to stare 3
fascinatedly at the distant black reef. When I spoke to him he did not answer, so I 3
knew I would have to let him finish the bottle. The insane yarn I was hearing 3
interested me profoundly, for I fancied there was contained within it a sort of 3
crude allegory based upon the strangeness of Innsmouth and elaborated by an 3
imagination at once creative and full of scraps of exotic legend. Not for a moment 3
did I believe that the tale had any really substantial foundation; but none the less 3
the account held a hint of genuine terror if only because it brought in references 3
to strange jewels clearly akin to the malign tiara I had seen at Newburyport. 3
Perhaps the ornaments had, after all, come from some strange island; and 3
possibly the wild stories were lies of the bygone Obed himself rather than of this 3
antique toper. 3
3
I handed Zadok the bottle, and he drained it to the last drop. It was curious how 3
he could stand so much whiskey, for not even a trace of thickness had come into 3
his high, wheezy voice. He licked the nose of the bottle and slipped it into his 3
pocket, then beginning to nod and whisper softly to himself. I bent close to catch 3
any articulate words he might utter, and thought I saw a sardonic smile behind 3
3
3
3
778 3
3
3
3
the stained bushy whiskers. Yes - he was really forming words, and I could grasp 3
a fair proportion of them. 3
3
"Poor Matt - Matt he alius was agin it - tried to line up the folks on his side, an' 3
had long talks with the preachers - no use - they run the Congregational parson 3
aout o' taown, an' the Methodist feller quit - never did see Resolved Babcock, the 3
Baptist parson, agin - Wrath 0' Jehovy - I was a mightly little critter, but I heerd 3
what I heerd an, seen what I seen - Dagon an' Ashtoreth - Belial an' Beelzebub - 3
Golden Caff an' the idols o' Canaan an' the Philistines - Babylonish abominations 3
- Mene, mene, tekel, upharisn - -." 3
3
He stopped again, and from the look in his watery blue eyes I feared he was 3
close to a stupor after all. But when I gently shook his shoulder he turned on me 3
with astonishing alertness and snapped out some more obscure phrases. 3
3
"Dun't believe me, hey? Hey, heh, heh - then jest tell me, young feller, why 3
Cap'n Obed an' twenty odd other folks used to row aout to Devil Reef in the 3
dead o' night an' chant things so laoud ye cud hear 'em all over taown when the 3
wind was right? Tell me that, hey? An' tell me why Obed was alius droppin' 3
heavy things daown into the deep water t'other side o' the reef whar the bottom 3
shoots daown like a cliff lower'n ye kin saound? Tell me what he done with that 3
funny-shaped lead thingumajig as Walakea give him? Hey, boy? An' what did 3
they all haowl on May-Eve, an, agin the next Hallowe'en? An' why'd the new 3
church parsons - fellers as used to he sailors - wear them queer robes an' cover 3
their-selves with them gold-like things Obed brung? Hey?" 3
3
The watery blue eyes were almost savage and maniacal now, and the dirty white 3
beard bristled electrically. Old Zadok probably saw me shrink back, for he began 3
to cackle evilly. 3
3
"Heh, heh, heh, heh! Beginni'n to see hey? Mebbe ye'd like to a ben me in them 3
days, when I seed things at night aout to sea from the cupalo top o' my haouse. 3
Oh, I kin tell ye' little pitchers hev big ears, an' I wa'n't missin' nothin' o' what 3
was gossiped abaout Cap'n Obed an' the folks aout to the reef! Heh, heh, heh! 3
Haow abaout the night I took my pa's ship's glass up to the cupalo an' seed the 3
reef a-bristlin' thick with shapes that dove off quick soon's the moon riz? 3
3
"Obed an' the folks was in a dory, but them shapes dove off the far side into the 3
deep water an' never come up . . . 3
3
"Haow'd ye like to be a little shaver alone up in a cupola a-watchin' shapes as 3
wa'n't human shapes? . . .Heh? . . . Heh, heh, heh . . ." 3
3
3
3
779 3
3
3
3
The old man was getting hysterical, and I began to shiver with a nameless alarm. 3
He laid a gnarled claw on my shoulder, and it seemed to me that its shaking was 3
not altogether that of mirth. 3
3
"S'pose one night ye seed somethin' heavy heaved often Obed's dory beyond the 3
reef and then learned next day a young feller was missin' from home. Hey! Did 3
anybody ever see hide or hair o' Hiram Gilman agin. Did they? An' Nick Pierce, 3
an' Luelly Waite, an' Adoniram Saouthwick, an' Henry Garrison Hey? Heh, heh, 3
heh, heh ... Shapes talkin' sign language with their hands ... them as had reel 3
hands ... 3
3
"Wal, Sir, that was the time Obed begun to git on his feet agin. Folks see his three 3
darters a-wearin' gold-like things as nobody'd never see on 'em afore, an' smoke 3
stared comin' aout o' the refin'ry chimbly. Other folks was prosp'rin, too - fish 3
begun to swarm into the harbour fit to kill' an' heaven knows what sized cargoes 3
we begun to ship aout to Newb'ryport, Arkham, an' Boston. T'was then Obed 3
got the ol' branch railrud put through. Some Kingsport fishermen heerd abaout 3
the ketch an' come up in sloops, but they was all lost. Nobody never see 'em 3
agin. An' jest then our folk organised the Esoteric Order 0' Dagon, an' bought 3
Masoic Hall often Calvary Commandery for it . . . heh, heh, heh! Matt Eliot was a 3
Mason an' agin the sellin', but he dropped aout o' sight jest then. 3
3
"Remember, I ain't sayin' Obed was set on hevin' things jest like they was on that 3
Kanaky isle. I dun't think he aimed at fust to do no mixin', nor raise no 3
younguns to take to the water an' turn into fishes with eternal life. He wanted 3
them gold things, an' was willin' to pay heavy, an' I guess the others was 3
satisfied fer a while . . . 3
3
"Come in' forty-six the taown done some lookin' an' thinkin' fer itself. Too many 3
folks missin' - too much wild preachin' at meetin' of a Sunday - too much talk 3
abaout that reef. I guess I done a bit by tellin' Selectman Mowry what I see from 3
the cupalo. They was a party one night as foUered Obed's craowd aout to the 3
reef, an' I heerd shots betwixt the dories. Nex' day Obed and thutty-two others 3
was in gaol, with everybody a-wonderin' jest what was afoot and jest what 3
charge agin 'em cud he got to holt. God, ef anybody'd look'd ahead ... a couple 3
o' weeks later, when nothin' had ben throwed into the sea fer thet long . . . 3
3
Zadok was shewing sings of fright and exhaustion, and I let him keep silence for 3
a while, though glancing apprehensively at my watch. The tide had turned and 3
was coming in now, and the sound of the waves seemed to arouse him. I was 3
glad of that tide, for at high water the fishy smell might not be so bad. Again I 3
strained to catch his whispers. 3
3
3
3
780 3
3
3
3
"That awful night ... I seed 'em. I was up in the cupalo ... hordes of 'em ... 3
swarms of 'em ... all over the reef an' swimmin' up the harbour into the Manuxet 3
. . . God, what happened in the streets of Innsmouth that night . . . they rattled our 3
door, but pa wouldn't open . . . then he dumb aout the kitchen winder with his 3
musket to find Selecman Mowry an' see what he cud do . . . Maounds o' the dead 3
an' the dyin' . . . shots and screams . . . shaoutin' in Ol Squar an' Taown Squar an' 3
New Church Green - gaol throwed open ... - proclamation . . . treason . . . called it 3
the plague when folks come in an' faoud haff our people missin' . . . nobody left 3
but them as ud jine in with Obed an' them things or else keep quiet ... never 3
heard o' my pa no more. . . " 3
3
The old man was panting and perspiring profusely. His grip on my shoulder 3
tightened. 3
3
"Everything cleaned up in the mornin' - but they was traces ... Obed he kinder 3
takes charge an' says things is goin' to be changed . . . others'll worship with us at 3
meetin'-time, an' sarten haouses hez got to entertin guests . . . they wanted to mix 3
like they done with the Kanakys, an' he for one didn't feel baound to stop 'em. 3
Far gone, was Obed . . . jest like a crazy man on the subjeck. He says they brung 3
us fish an' treasure, an' shud hev what they hankered after ..." 3
3
"Nothin' was to be diff'runt on the aoutsid; only we was to keep shy o' strangers 3
ef we knowed what was good fer us. 3
3
"We all hed to take the Oath o' Dagon, an' later on they was secon' an' third 3
oaths that some o' us took. Them as ud help special, ud git special rewards - gold 3
an' sech - No use balkin', fer they was millions of 'em daown thar. They'd ruther 3
not start risin' an' wipin' aout human-kind, but ef they was gave away an' forced 3
to, they cud do a lot toward jest that. We didn't hev them old charms to cut 'em 3
off like folks in the Saouth Sea did, an' them Kanakys wudu't never give away 3
their secrets. 3
3
"Yield up enough sacrifices an' savage knick-knacks an' harbourage in the taown 3
when they wanted it, an' they'd let well enough alone. Wudn't bother no 3
strangers as might bear tales aoutside - that is, withaout they got pry in'. All in 3
the band of the faithful - Order 0' Dagon - an' the children shud never die, but go 3
back to the Mother Hydra an' Father Dagon what we all come from onct ... la! la! 3
Cthulhu fhtagn! Ph'nglui mglw'nafh Cthulhu R'lyeh wgah-nagl fhtaga - " 3
3
Old Zadok was fast lapsing into stark raving, and I held my breath. Poor old soul 3
- to what pitiful depths of hallucination had his liquor, plus his hatred of the 3
decay, alienage, and disease around him, brought that fertile, imaginative brain? 3
3
3
3
781 3
3
3
3
He began to moan now, and tears were coursing down his channelled checks 3
into the depths of his beard. 3
3
"God, what I seen senct I was fifteen year' old - Mene, mene, tekel, upharsin! - 3
the folks as was missin', and them as kilt theirselves - them as told things in 3
Arkham or Ipswich or sech places was all called crazy, like you're callin' me 3
right naow - but God, what I seen - They'd a kilt me long ago fer' what I know, 3
only I'd took the fust an' secon' Oaths o' Dago offen Obed, so was pertected 3
unlessen a jury of 'em proved I told things knowin' an' delib'rit . . . but I wudn't 3
take the third Oath - I'd a died ruther'n take that - 3
3
"It got wuss araound Civil War time, when children born senct 'forty-six begun 3
to grow up - some 'em, that is. I was afeared - never did no pryin' arter that 3
awful night, an' never see one o' - them - clost to in all my life. That is, never no 3
full-blooded one. I went to the war, an' ef I'd a had any guts or sense I'd a never 3
come back, but settled away from here. But folks wrote me things wa'n't so bad. 3
That, I s'pose, was because gov'munt draft men was in taown arter 'sixty-three. 3
Arter the war it was jest as bad agin. People begun to fall off - mills an' shops 3
shet daown - shippin' stopped an' the harbour choked up - railrud give up - but 3
they ... they never stopped swimmin' in an' aout o' the river from that cursed 3
reef o' Satan - an' more an' more attic winders got a-boarded up, an' more an' 3
more noises was heerd in haouses as wa'n't s'posed to hev nobody in 'em. . . 3
3
"Folks aoutside hev their stories abaout us - s'pose you've heerd a plenty on 'em, 3
seein' what questions ye ast - stories abaout things they've seed naow an' then, 3
an' abaout that queer joolry as still comes in from somewhars an' ain't quite all 3
melted up - but nothin' never gits def'nite. Nobody'll believe nothin'. They call 3
them gold-like things pirate loot, an' allaow the Innsmouth folks hez furren 3
blood or is dis-tempered or somethin'. Beside, them that lives here shoo off as 3
many strangers as they kin, an' encourage the rest not to git very cur'ous, 3
specially raound night time. Beasts balk at the critters - bosses wuss'n mules - but 3
when they got autos that was all right. 3
3
"In 'forty-six Cap'n Obed took a second wife that nobody in the taown never see 3
- some says he didn't want to, but was made to by them as he'd called in - had 3
three children by her - two as disappeared young, but one gal as looked like 3
anybody else an' was eddicated in Europe. Obed finally got her married off by a 3
trick to an Arkham feller as didn't suspect nothin'. But nobody aoutside'll hav 3
nothin' to do with Innsmouth folks naow. Barnabas Marsh that runs the refin'ry 3
now is Obed's grandson by his fust wife - son of Onesiphorus, his eldest son, but 3
his mother was another o' them as wa'n't never seen aoutdoors. 3
3
3
3
782 3
3
3
3
"Right naow Barnabas is abaout changed. Can't shet his eyes no more, an' is all 3
aout o' shape. They say he still wears clothes, but he'll take to the water soon. 3
Mebbe he's tried it already - they do sometimes go daown for little spells afore 3
they go daown for good. Ain't ben seed abaout in public fer nigh on ten year'. 3
Dun't know haow his poor wife kin feel - she come from Ipiwich, an' they nigh 3
lynched Barnabas when he courted her fifty odd year' ago. Obed he died in 3
'seventy-eight an' all the next gen'ration is gone naow - the fust wife's children 3
dead, and the rest . . . God knows ..." 3
3
The sound of the incoming tide was now very insistent, and little by little it 3
seemed to change the old man's mood from maudlin tearfulness to watchful fear. 3
He would pause now and then to renew those nervous glances over his shoulder 3
or out toward the reef, and despite the wild absurdity of his tale, I could not help 3
beginning to share his apprehensiveness. Zadok now grew shriller, seemed to be 3
trying to whip up his courage with louder speech. 3
3
"Hey, yew, why dun't ye say somethin'? Haow'd ye like to he livin' in a taown 3
like this, with everything a-rottin' an' dyin', an' boarded-up monsters crawlin' 3
an' bleatin' an' barkin' an' hoppin' araoun' black cellars an' attics every way ye 3
turn? Hey? Haow'd ye like to hear the haowlin' night arter night from the 3
churches an' Order 0' Dagon Hall, an' know what's doin' part o' the haowlin'? 3
Haow'd ye like to hear what comes from that awful reef every May-Eve an' 3
Hallowmass? Hey? Think the old man's crazy, eh? Wal, Sir, let me tell ye that 3
ain't the wust!" 3
3
Zadok was really screaming now, and the mad frenzy of his voice disturbed me 3
more than I care to own. 3
3
"Curse ye, dun't set thar a'starin' at me with them eyes - 1 tell Obed Marsh he's 3
in hell, an, hez got to stay thar! Heh, heh ... in hell, I says! Can't git me - I hain't 3
done nothin' nor told nobody nothin' - - 3
3
"Oh, you, young feller? Wal, even ef I hain't told nobody nothin' yet, I'm a'goin' 3
to naow! Yew jest set still an' listen to me, boy - this is what I ain't never told 3
nobody... I says I didn't get to do pryin' arter that night - but I faound things 3
about jest the same!" 3
3
"Yew want to know what the reel horror is, hey? Wal, it's this - it ain't what them 3
fish devils hez done, but what they're a-goin' to do! They're a-bringin' things up 3
aout o' whar they come from into the taown - been doin' it fer years, an' 3
slackenin' up lately. Them haouses north o' the river be-twixt Water an' Main 3
Streets is full of 'em - them devils an' what they brung - an' when they git ready 3
... I say, when they git. . . ever hear tell of a shoggoth? 3
3
3
3
783 3
3
3
3
"Hey, d'ye hear me? I tell ye I know what them things be - I seen 'em one night 3
when . . . eh-ahhh-ah! e'yahhh ..." 3
3
The hideous suddenness and inhuman Rightfulness of the old man's shriek 3
almost made me faint. His eyes, looking past me toward the malodorous sea, 3
were positively starting from his head; while his face was a mask of fear worthy 3
of Greek tragedy. His bony claw dug monstrously into my shoulder, and he 3
made no motion as I turned my head to look at whatever he had glimpsed. 3
3
There was nothing that I could see. Only the incoming tide, with perhaps one set 3
of ripples more local than the long-flung line of breakers. But now Zadok was 3
shaking me, and I turned back to watch the melting of that fear-frozen face into a 3
chaos of twitching eyelids and mumbling gums. Presently his voice came back - 3
albeit as a trembling whisper. 3
3
"Git aout o' here! Get aout o' here! They seen us - git aout fer your life! Dun't 3
wait fer nothin' - they know naow - Run fer it - quick - aout o' this taown - -" 3
3
Another heavy wave dashed against the loosing masonry of the bygone wharf, 3
and changed the mad ancient's whisper to another inhuman and blood-curdling 3
scream. "E-yaahhhh! . . . Yheaaaaaa! ..." 3
3
Before I could recover my scattered wits he had relaxed his clutch on my 3
shoulder and dashed wildly inland toward the street, reeling northward around 3
the ruined warehouse wall. 3
3
I glanced back at the sea, but there was nothing there. And when I reached Water 3
Street and looked along it toward the north there was no remaining trace of 3
Zadok Allen. 3
3
IV 3
3
I can hardly describe the mood in which I was left by this harrowing episode - an 3
episode at once mad and pitiful, grotesque and terrifying. The grocery boy had 3
prepared me for it, yet the reality left me none the less bewildered and disturbed. 3
Puerile though the story was, old Zadok's insane earnestness and horror had 3
communicated to me a mounting unrest which joined with my earlier sense of 3
loathing for the town and its blight of intangible shadow. 3
3
Later I might sift the tale and extract some nucleus of historic allegory; just now I 3
wished to put it out of my head. The hour grown perilously late - my watch said 3
7:15, and the Arkham bus left Town Square at eight - so I tried to give my 3
thoughts as neutral and practical a cast as possible, meanwhile walking rapidly 3
3
3
3
784 3
3
3
3
through the deserted streets of gaping roofs and leaning houses toward the hotel 3
where I had checked my valise and would find my bus. 3
3
Though the golden light of late afternoon gave the ancient roofs and decrepit 3
chimneys an air of mystic loveliness and peace, I could not help glancing over 3
my shoulder now and then. I would surely be very glad to get out of malodorous 3
and fear-shadowed Innsmouth, and wished there were some other vehicle than 3
the bus driven by that sinister-looking fellow Sargent. Yet I did not hurry too 3
precipitately, for there were architectural details worth viewing at every silent 3
corner; and I could easily, I calculated, cover the necessary distance in a half- 3
hour. 3
3
Studying the grocery youth's map and seeking a route I had not traversed before, 3
I chose Marsh Street instead of State for my approach to Town Square. Near the 3
corner of Fall street I began to see scattered groups of furtive whisperers, and 3
when I finally reached the Square I saw that almost all the loiterers were 3
congregated around the door of the Gilman House. It seemed as if many bulging, 3
watery, unwinking eyes looked oddly at me as I claimed my valise in the lobby, 3
and I hoped that none of these unpleasant creatures would be my fellow- 3
passengers on the coach. 3
3
The bus, rather early, rattled in with three passengers somewhat before eight, 3
and an evil-looking fellow on the sidewalk muttered a few indistinguishable 3
words to the driver. Sargent threw out a mail-bag and a roll of newspapers, and 3
entered the hotel; while the passengers - the same men whom I had seen arriving 3
in Newburyport that morning - shambled to the sidewalk and exchanged some 3
faint guttural words with a loafer in a language I could have sworn was not 3
English. I boarded the empty coach and took the seat I had taken before, but was 3
hardly settled before Sargent re-appeared and began mumbling in a throaty 3
voice of peculiar repulsiveness. 3
3
I was, it appeared, in very bad luck. There had been something wrong with the 3
engine, despite the excellent time made from Newburyport, and the bus could 3
not complete the journey to Arkham. No, it could not possibly be repaired that 3
night, nor was there any other way of getting transportation out of Innsmouth 3
either to Arkham or elsewhere. Sargent was sorry, but I would have to stop over 3
at the Gilman. Probably the clerk would make the price easy for me, but there 3
was nothing else to do. Almost dazed by this sudden obstacle, and violently 3
dreading the fall of night in this decaying and half-unlighted town, I left the bus 3
and reentered the hotel lobby; where the sullen queer-looking night clerk told me 3
I could have Room 428 on next the top floor - large, but without running water - 3
for a dollar. 3
3
3
3
785 3
3
3
3
Despite what I had heard of this hotel in Newburyport, I signed the register, paid 3
my dollar, let the clerk take my valise, and followed that sour, solitary attendant 3
up three creaking flights of stairs past dusty corridors which seemed wholly 3
devoid of life. My room was a dismal rear one with two windows and bare, 3
cheap furnishings, overlooked a dingy court-yard otherwise hemmed in by low, 3
deserted brick blocks, and commanded a view of decrepit westward-stretching 3
roofs with a marshy countryside beyond. At the end of the corridor was a 3
bathroom - a discouraging relique with ancient marble bowl, tin tub, faint electric 3
light, and musty wooded paneling around all the plumbing fixtures. 3
3
It being still daylight, I descended to the Square and looked around for a dinner 3
of some sort; noticing as I did so the strange glances I received from the 3
unwholesome loafers. Since the grocery was closed, I was forced to patronise the 3
restaurant I had shunned before; a stooped, narrow-headed man with staring, 3
unwinking eyes, and a flat-nosed wench with unbelievably thick, clumsy hands 3
being in attendance. The service was all of the counter type, and it relieved me to 3
find that much was evidently served from cans and packages. A bowl of 3
vegetable soup with crackers was enough for me, and I soon headed back for my 3
cheerless room at the Gilman; getting a evening paper and a fly-specked 3
magazine from the evil-visaged clerk at the rickety stand beside his desk. 3
3
As twilight deepened I turned on the one feeble electric bulb over the cheap, 3
iron-framed bed, and tried as best I could to continue the reading I had begun. I 3
felt it advisable to keep my mind wholesomely occupied, for it would not do to 3
brood over the abnormalities of this ancient, blight-shadowed town while I was 3
still within its borders. The insane yarn I had heard from the aged drunkard did 3
not promise very pleasant dreams, and I felt I must keep the image of his wild, 3
watery eyes as far as possible from my imagination. 3
3
Also, I must not dwell on what that factory inspector had told the Newburyport 3
ticket-agent about the Gilman House and the voices of its nocturnal tenants - not 3
on that, nor on the face beneath the tiara in the black church doorway; the face 3
for whose horror my conscious mind could not account. It would perhaps have 3
been easier to keep my thoughts from disturbing topics had the room not been so 3
gruesomely musty. As it was, the lethal mustiness blended hideously with the 3
town's general fishy odour and persistently focussed one's fancy on death and 3
decay. 3
3
Another thing that disturbed me was the absence of a bolt on the door of my 3
room. One had been there, as marks clearly shewed, but there were signs of 3
recent removal. No doubt it had been out of order, like so many other things in 3
this decrepit edifice. In my nervousness I looked around and discovered a bolt 3
on the clothes press which seemed to be of the same size, judging from the 3
3
3
3
786 3
3
3
3
marks, as the one formerly on the door. To gain a partial relief from the general 3
tension I busied myself by transferring this hardware to the vacant place with the 3
aid of a handy three-in-one device including a screwdriver which I kept on my 3
key-ring. The bolt fitted perfectly, and I was somewhat relieved when I knew 3
that I could shoot it firmly upon retiring. Not that I had any real apprehension of 3
its need, but that any symbol of security was welcome in an environment of this 3
kind. There were adequate bolts on the two lateral doors to connecting rooms, 3
and these I proceeded to fasten. 3
3
I did not undress, but decided to read till I was sleepy and then lie down with 3
only my coat, collar, and shoes off. Taking a pocket flash light from my valise, I 3
placed it in my trousers, so that I could read my watch if I woke up later in the 3
dark. Drowsiness, however, did not come; and when I stopped to analyse my 3
thoughts I found to my disquiet that I was really unconsciously listening for 3
something - listening for something which I dreaded but could not name. That 3
inspector's story must have worked on my imagination more deeply than I had 3
suspected. Again I tried to read, but found that I made no progress. 3
3
After a time I seemed to hear the stairs and corridors creak at intervals as if with 3
footsteps, and wondered if the other rooms were beginning to fill up. There were 3
no voices, however, and it struck me that there was something subtly furtive 3
about the creaking. I did not like it, and debated whether I had better try to sleep 3
at all. This town had some queer people, and there had undoubtedly been 3
several disappearances. Was this one of those inns where travelers were slain for 3
their money? Surely I had no look of excessive prosperity. Or were the towns 3
folk really so resentful about curious visitors? Had my obvious sightseeing, with 3
its frequent map-consultations, aroused unfavorable notice. It occurred to me 3
that I must be in a highly nervous state to let a few random creakings set me off 3
speculating in this fashion - but I regretted none the less that I was unarmed. 3
3
At length, feeling a fatigue which had nothing of drowsiness in it, I bolted the 3
newly outfitted hall door, turned off the light, and threw myself down on the 3
hard, uneven bed - coat, collar, shoes, and all. In the darkness every faint noise of 3
the night seemed magnified, and a flood of doubly unpleasant thoughts swept 3
over me. I was sorry I had put out the light, yet was too tired to rise and turn it 3
on again. Then, after a long, dreary interval, and prefaced by a fresh creaking of 3
stairs and corridor, there came that soft, damnably unmistakable sound which 3
seemed like a malign fulfillment of all my apprehensions. Without the least 3
shadow of a doubt, the lock of my door was being tried - cautiously, furtively, 3
tentatively - with a key. 3
3
My sensations upon recognising this sign of actual peril were perhaps less rather 3
than more tumultuous because of my previous vague fears. I had been, albeit 3
3
3

3
without definite reason, instinctively on my guard - and that was to my 3
advantage in the new and real crisis, whatever it might turn out to be. 3
Nevertheless the change in the menace from vague premonition to immediate 3
reality was a profound shock, and fell upon me with the force of a genuine blow. 3
It never once occurred to me that the fumbling might be a mere mistake. Malign 3
purpose was all I could think of, and I kept deathly quiet, awaiting the would-be 3
intruder's next move. 3
3
After a time the cautious rattling ceased, and I heard the room to the north 3
entered with a pass key. Then the lock of the connecting door to my room was 3
softly tried. The bolt held, of course, and I heard the floor creak as the prowler 3
left the room. After a moment there came another soft rattling, and I knew that 3
the room to the south of me was being entered. Again a furtive trying of a bolted 3
connecting door, and again a receding creaking. This time the creaking went 3
along the hall and down the stairs, so I knew that the prowler had realised the 3
bolted condition of my doors and was giving up his attempt for a greater or 3
lesser time, as the future would shew. 3
3
The readiness with which I fell into a plan of action proves that I must have been 3
subconsciously fearing some menace and considering possible avenues of escape 3
for hours. From the first I felt that the unseen tumbler meant a danger not to be 3
met or dealt with, but only to be fled from as precipitately as possible. The one 3
thing to do was to get out of that hotel alive as quickly as I could, and through 3
some channel other than the front stairs and lobby. 3
3
Rising softly and throwing my flashlight on the switch, I sought to light the bulb 3
over my bed in order to choose and pocket some belongings for a swift, valiseless 3
flight. Nothing, however, happened; and I saw that the power had been cut off. 3
Clearly, some cryptic, evil movement was afoot on a large scale - just what, I 3
could not say. As I stood pondering with my hand on the now useless switch I 3
heard a muffled creaking on the floor below, and thought I could barely 3
distinguish voices in conversation. A moment later I felt less sure that the deeper 3
sounds were voices, since the apparent hoarse barkings and loose-syllabled 3
croakings bore so little resemblance to recognized human speech. Then I thought 3
with renewed force of what the factory inspector had heard in the night in this 3
mouldering and pestilential building. 3
3
Having filled my pockets with the flashlight's aid, I put on my hat and tiptoed to 3
the windows to consider chances of descent. Despite the state's safety regulations 3
there was no fire escape on this side of the hotel, and I saw that my windows 3
commanded only a sheer three story drop to the cobbled courtyard. On the right 3
and left, however, some ancient brick business blocks abutted on the hotel; their 3
slant roofs coming up to a reasonable jumping distance from my fourth-story 3
3
3
3

3
3
3
level. To reach either of these lines of buildings I would have to be in a room two 3
from my own - in one case on the north and in the other case on the south - and 3
my mind instantly set to work what chances I had of making the transfer. 3
3
I could not, I decided, risk an emergence into the corridor; where my footsteps 3
would surely be heard, and where the difficulties of entering the desired room 3
would be insuperable. My progress, if it was to be made at all, would have to be 3
through the less solidly-built connecting doors of the rooms; the locks and bolts 3
of which I would have to force violently, using my shoulder as a battering-ram 3
whenever they were set against me. This, I thought, would be possible owing to 3
the rickety nature of the house and its fixtures; but I realised I could not do it 3
noiselessly. I would have to count on sheer speed, and the chance of getting to a 3
window before any hostile forces became coordinated enough to open the right 3
door toward me with a pass-key. My own outer door I reinforced by pushing the 3
bureau against it - little by little, in order to make a minimum of sound. 3
3
I perceived that my chances were very slender, and was fully prepared for any 3
calamity. Even getting to another roof would not solve the problem for there 3
would then remain the task of reaching the ground and escaping from the town. 3
One thing in my favour was the deserted and ruinous state of the abutting 3
building and the number of skylights gaping blackly open in each row. 3
3
Gathering from the grocery boy's map that the best route out of town was 3
southward, I glanced first at the connecting door on the south side of the room. It 3
was designed to open in my direction, hence I saw - after drawing the bolt and 3
finding other fastening in place - it was not a favorable one for forcing. 3
Accordingly abandoning it as a route, I cautiously moved the bedstead against it 3
to hamper any attack which might be made on it later from the next room. The 3
door on the north was hung to open away from me, and this - though a test 3
proved it to be locked or bolted from the other side - I knew must be my route. If 3
I could gain the roofs of the buildings in Paine Street and descend successfully to 3
the ground level, I might perhaps dart through the courtyard and the adjacent or 3
opposite building to Washington or Bates - or else emerge in Paine and edge 3
around southward into Washington. In any case, I would aim to strike 3
Washington somehow and get quickly out of the Town Square region. My 3
preference would be to avoid Paine, since the fire station there might be open all 3
night. 3
3
As I thought of these things I looked out over the squalid sea of decaying roofs 3
below me, now brightened by the beams of a moon not much past full. On the 3
right the black gash of the river-gorge clove the panorama; abandoned factories 3
and railway station clinging barnacle-like to its sides. Beyond it the rusted 3
railway and the Rowley road led off through a flat marshy terrain dotted with 3
3
3
3
789 3
3
3
3
islets of higher and dryer scrub-grown land. On the left the creek-threaded 3
country-side was nearer, the narrow road to Ipswich gleaming white in the 3
moonlight. I could not see from my side of the hotel the southward route toward 3
Arkham which I had determined to take. 3
3
I was irresolutely speculating on when I had better attack the northward door, 3
and on how I could least audibly manage it, when I noticed that the vague noises 3
underfoot had given place to a fresh and heavier creaking of the stairs. A 3
wavering flicker of light shewed through my transom, and the boards of the 3
corridor began to groan with a ponderous load. Muffled sounds of possible vocal 3
origin approached, and at length a firm knock came at my outer door. 3
3
For a moment I simply held my breath and waited. Eternities seemed to elapse, 3
and the nauseous fishy odour of my environment seemed to mount suddenly 3
and spectacularly. Then the knocking was repeated - continuously, and with 3
growing insistence. I knew that the time for action had come, and forthwith drew 3
the bolt of the northward connecting door, bracing myself for the task of 3
battering it open. The knocking waxed louder, and I hoped that its volume 3
would cover the sound of my efforts. At last beginning my attempt, I lunged 3
again and again at the thin paneling with my left shoulder, heedless of shock or 3
pain. The door resisted even more than I expected, but I did not give in. And all 3
the while the clamour at the outer door increased. 3
3
Finally the connecting door gave, but with such a crash that I knew those outside 3
must have heard. Instantly the outside knocking became a violent battering, 3
while keys sounded ominously in the hall doors of the rooms on both sides of 3
me. Rushing through the newly opened connexion, I succeeded in bolting the 3
northerly hall door before the lock could he turned; but even as I did so I heard 3
the hall door of the third room - the one from whose window I had hoped to 3
reach the roof below - being tried with a pass key. 3
3
For an instant I felt absolute despair, since my trapping in a chamber with no 3
window egress seemed complete. A wave of almost abnormal horror swept over 3
me, and invested with a terrible but unexplainable singularity the flashlight- 3
glimpsed dust prints made by the intruder who had lately tried my door from 3
this room. Then, with a dazed automatism which persisted despite hopelessness, 3
I made for the next connecting door and performed the blind motion of pushing 3
at it in an effort to get through and - granting that fastenings might be as 3
providentially intact as in this second room - bolt the hall door beyond before the 3
lock could be turned from outside. 3
3
Sheer fortunate chance gave me my reprieve - for the connecting door before me 3
was not only unlocked but actually ajar. In a second I was though, and had my 3
3
3
3
790 3
3
3
3
right knee and shoulder against a hall door which was visibly opening inward. 3
My pressure took the opener off guard, for the thing shut as I pushed, so that I 3
could slip the well-conditioned bolt as I had done with the other door. As I 3
gained this respite I heard the battering at the two other doors abate, while a 3
confused clatter came from the connecting door I had shielded with the 3
bedstead. Evidently the bulk of my assailants had entered the southerly room 3
and were massing in a lateral attack. But at the same moment a pass key sounded 3
in the next door to the north, and I knew that a nearer peril was at hand. 3
3
The northward connecting door was wide open, but there was no time to think 3
about checking the already turning lock in the hall. All I could do was to shut 3
and bolt the open connecting door, as well as its mate on the opposite side - 3
pushing a bedstead against the one and a bureau against the other, and moving a 3
washstand in front of the hall door. I must, I saw, trust to such makeshift barriers 3
to shield me till I could get out the window and on the roof of the Paine Street 3
block. But even in this acute moment my chief horror was something apart from 3
the immediate weakness of my defenses. I was shuddering because not one of 3
my pursuers, despite some hideous panting, grunting, and subdued barkings at 3
odd intervals, was uttering an unmuffled or intelligible vocal sound. 3
3
As I moved the furniture and rushed toward the windows I heard a frightful 3
scurrying along the corridor toward the room north of me, and perceived that 3
the southward battering had ceased. Plainly, most of my opponents were about 3
to concentrate against the feeble connecting door which they knew must open 3
directly on me. Outside, the moon played on the ridgepole of the block below, 3
and I saw that the jump would be desperately hazardous because of the steep 3
surface on which I must land. 3
3
Surveying the conditions, I chose the more southerly of the two windows as my 3
avenue of escape; planning to land on the inner slope of the roof and make for 3
the nearest sky-light. Once inside one of the decrepit brick structures I would 3
have to reckon with pursuit; but I hoped to descend and dodge in and out of 3
yawning doorways along the shadowed courtyard, eventually getting to 3
Washington Street and slipping out of town toward the south. 3
3
The clatter at the northerly connecting door was now terrific, and I saw that the 3
weak panelling was beginning to splinter. Obviously, the besiegers had brought 3
some ponderous object into play as a battering-ram. The bedstead, however, still 3
held firm; so that I had at least a faint chance of making good my escape. As I 3
opened the window I noticed that it was flanked by heavy velour draperies 3
suspended from a pole by brass rings, and also that there was a large projecting 3
catch for the shutters on the exterior. Seeing a possible means of avoiding the 3
dangerous jump, I yanked at the hangings and brought them down, pole and all; 3
3
3
3
791 3
3
3
3
then quickly hooking two of the rings in the shutter catch and flinging the 3
drapery outside. The heavy folds reached fully to the abutting roof, and I saw 3
that the rings and catch would be likely to bear my weight. So, climbing out of 3
the window and down the improvised rope ladder, I left behind me forever the 3
morbid and horror-infested fabric of the Gilman House. 3
3
I landed safely on the loose slates of the steep roof, and succeeded in gaining the 3
gaping black skylight without a slip. Glancing up at the window I had left, I 3
observed it was still dark, though far across the crumbling chimneys to the north 3
I could see lights ominously blazing in the Order of Dagon Hall, the Baptist 3
church, and the Congregational church which I recalled so shiveringly. There 3
had seemed to be no one in the courtyard below, and I hoped there would be a 3
chance to get away before the spreading of a general alarm. Flashing my pocket 3
lamp into the skylight, I saw that there were no steps down. The distance was 3
slight, however, so I clambered over the brink and dropped; striking a dusty 3
floor littered with crumbling boxes and barrels. 3
3
The place was ghoulish-looking, but I was past minding such impressions and 3
made at once for the staircase revealed by my flashlight - after a hasty glance at 3
my watch, which shewed the hour to be 2 a.m. The steps creaked, but seemed 3
tolerably sound; and I raced down past a barnlike second storey to the ground 3
floor. The desolation was complete, and only echoes answered my footfalls. At 3
length I reached the lower hall at the end of which I saw a faint luminous 3
rectangle marking the ruined Paine Street doorway. Heading the other way, I 3
found the back door also open; and darted out and down five stone steps to the 3
grass-grown cobblestones of the courtyard. 3
3
The moonbeams did not reach down here, but I could just see my way about 3
without using the flashlight. Some of the windows on the Gilman House side 3
were faintly glowing, and I thought I heard confused sounds within. Walking 3
softly over to the Washington Street side I perceived several open doorways, and 3
chose the nearest as my route out. The hallway inside was black, and when I 3
reached the opposite end I saw that the street door was wedged immovably shut. 3
Resolved to try another building, I groped my way back toward the courtyard, 3
but stopped short when close to the doorway. 3
3
For out of an opened door in the Gilman House a large crowd of doubtful shapes 3
was pouring - lanterns bobbing in the darkness, and horrible croaking voices 3
exchanging low cries in what was certainly not English. The figures moved 3
uncertainly, and I realized to my relief that they did not know where I had gone; 3
but for all that they sent a shiver of horror through my frame. Their features 3
were indistinguishable, but their crouching, shambling gait was abominably 3
repellent. And worst of all, I perceived that one figure was strangely robed, and 3
3
3
3
792 3
3
3
3
unmistakably surmounted by a tall tiara of a design altogether too familiar. As 3
the figures spread throughout the courtyard, I felt my fears increase. Suppose I 3
could find no egress from this building on the street side? The fishy odour was 3
detestable, and I wondered I could stand it without fainting. Again groping 3
toward the street, I opened a door off the hall and came upon an empty room 3
with closely shuttered but sashless windows. Fumbling in the rays of my 3
flashlight, I found I could open the shutters; and in another moment had climbed 3
outside and was fully closing the aperture in its original manner. 3
3
I was now in Washington Street, and for the moment saw no living thing nor any 3
light save that of the moon. From several directions in the distance, however, I 3
could hear the sound of hoarse voices, of footsteps, and of a curious kind of 3
pattering which did not sound quite like footsteps. Plainly I had no time to lose. 3
The points of the compass were clear to me, and I was glad that all the street 3
lights were turned off, as is often the custom on strongly moonlit nights in 3
prosperous rural regions. Some of the sounds came from the south, yet I retained 3
my design of escaping in that direction. There would, I knew, be plenty of 3
deserted doorways to shelter me in case I met any person or group who looked 3
like pursuers. 3
3
I walked rapidly, softly, and close to the ruined houses. While hatless and 3
dishevelled after my arduous climb, I did not look especially noticeable; and 3
stood a good chance of passing unheeded if forced to encounter any casual 3
wayfarer. 3
3
At Bates Street I drew into a yawning vestibule while two shambling figures 3
crossed in front of me, but was soon on my way again and approaching the open 3
space where Eliot Street obliquely crosses Washington at the intersection of 3
South. Though I had never seen this space, it had looked dangerous to me on the 3
grocery youth's map; since the moonlight would have free play there. There was 3
no use trying to evade it, for any alternative course would involve detours of 3
possibly disastrous visibility and delaying effect. The only thing to do was to 3
cross it boldly and openly; imitating the typical shamble of the Innsmouth folk as 3
best I could, and trusting that no one - or at least no pursuer of mine - would be 3
there. 3
3
Just how fully the pursuit was organised - and indeed, just what its purpose 3
might be - I could form no idea. There seemed to be unusual activity in the town, 3
but I judged that the news of my escape from the Gilman had not yet spread. I 3
would, of course, soon have to shift from Washington to some other southward 3
street; for that party from the hotel would doubtless be after me. I must have left 3
dust prints in that last old building, revealing how I had gained the street. 3
3
3
3
793 3
3
3
3
The open space was, as I had expected, strongly moonht; and I saw the remains 3
of a parkhke, iron-railed green in its center. Fortunately no one was about though 3
a curious sort of buzz or roar seemed to be increasing in the direction of Town 3
Square. South Street was very wide, leading directly down a slight declivity to 3
the waterfront and commanding a long view out a sea; and I hoped that no one 3
would be glancing up it from afar as I crossed in the bright moonlight. 3
3
My progress was unimpeded, and no fresh sound arose to hint that I had been 3
spied. Glancing about me, I involuntarily let my pace slacken for a second to take 3
in the sight of the sea, gorgeous in the burning moonlight at the street's end. Far 3
out beyond the breakwater was the dim, dark line of Devil Reef, and as I 3
glimpsed it I could not help thinking of all the hideous legends I had heard in the 3
last twenty-four hours - legends which portrayed this ragged rock as a veritable 3
gateway to realms of unfathomed horror and inconceivable abnormality. 3
3
Then, without warning, I saw the intermittent flashes of light on the distant reef. 3
They were definite and unmistakable, and awaked in my mind a blind horror 3
beyond all rational proportion. My muscles tightened for panic flight, held in 3
only by a certain unconscious caution and half-hypnotic fascination. And to 3
make matters worse, there now flashed forth from the lofty cupola of the Gilman 3
House, which loomed up to the northeast behind me, a series of analogous 3
though differently spaced gleams which could be nothing less than an answering 3
signal. 3
3
Controlling my muscles, and realising afresh - how plainly visible I was, I 3
resumed my brisker and feignedly shambling pace; though keeping my eyes on 3
that hellish and ominous reef as long as the opening of South Street gave me a 3
seaward view. What the whole proceeding meant, I could not imagine; unless it 3
involved some strange rite connected with Devil Reef, or unless some party had 3
landed from a ship on that sinister rock. I now bent to the left around the ruinous 3
green; still gazing toward the ocean as it blazed in the spectral summer 3
moonlight, and watching the cryptical flashing of those nameless, unexplainable 3
beacons. 3
3
It was then that the most horrible impression of all was borne in upon me - the 3
impression which destroyed my last vestige of self-control and sent me running 3
frantically southward past the yawning black doorways and fishily staring 3
windows of that deserted nightmare street. For at a closer glance I saw that the 3
moonlit waters between the reef and the shore were far from empty. They were 3
alive with a teeming horde of shapes swimming inward toward the town; and 3
even at my vast distance and in my single moment of perception I could tell that 3
the bobbing heads and flailing arms were alien and aberrant in a way scarcely to 3
be expressed or consciously formulated. 3
3
3
3
794 3
3
3
3
My frantic running ceased before I had covered a block, for at my left I began to 3
hear something like the hue and cry of organised pursuit. There were footsteps 3
and gutteral sounds, and a rattling motor wheezed south along Federal Street. In 3
a second all my plans were utterly changed - for if the southward highway were 3
blocked ahead of me, I must clearly find another egress from Innsmouth. I 3
paused and drew into a gaping doorway, reflecting how lucky I was to have left 3
the moonlit open space before these pursuers came down the parallel street. 3
3
A second reflection was less comforting. Since the pursuit was down another 3
street, it was plain that the party was not following me directly. It had not seen 3
me, but was simply obeying a general plan of cutting off my escape. This, 3
however, implied that all roads leading out of Innsmouth were similarly 3
patrolled; for the people could not have known what route I intended to take. If 3
this were so, I would have to make my retreat across country away from any 3
road; but how could I do that in view of the marshy and creek-riddled nature of 3
all the surrounding region? For a moment my brain reeled - both from sheer 3
hopelessness and from a rapid increase in the omnipresent fishy odour. 3
3
Then I thought of the abandoned railway to Rowley, whose solid line of 3
ballasted, weed-grown earth still stretched off to the northwest from the 3
crumbling station on the edge at the river-gorge. There was just a chance that the 3
townsfolk would not think of that; since its briar-choked desertion made it half- 3
impassable, and the unlikeliest of all avenues for a fugitive to choose. I had seen 3
it clearly from my hotel window and knew about how it lay. Most of its earlier 3
length was uncomfortably visible from the Rowley road, and from high places in 3
the town itself; but one could perhaps crawl inconspicuously through the 3
undergrowth. At any rate, it would form my only chance of deliverance, and 3
there was nothing to do but try it. 3
3
Drawing inside the hall of my deserted shelter, I once more consulted the 3
grocery boy's map with the aid of the flashlight. The immediate problem was 3
how to reach the ancient railway; and I now saw that the safest course was ahead 3
to Babson Street; then west to Lafayette - there edging around but not crossing an 3
open space homologous to the one I had traversed - and subsequently back 3
northward and westward in a zigzagging line through Lafayette, Bates, Adam, 3
and Bank streets - the latter skirting the river gorge - to the abandoned and 3
dilapidated station I had seen from my window. My reason for going ahead to 3
Babson was that I wished neither to recross the earlier open space nor to begin 3
my westward course along a cross street as broad as South. 3
3
Starting once more, I crossed the street to the right-hand side in order to edge 3
around into Babeon as inconspicuously as possible. Noises still continued in 3
Federal Street, and as I glanced behind me I thought I saw a gleam of light near 3
3
3
3
795 3
3
3
3
the building through which I had escaped. Anxious to leave Washington Street, I 3
broke into a quiet dogtrot, trusting to luck not to encounter any observing eye. 3
Next the corner of Babson Street I saw to my alarm that one of the houses was 3
still inhabited, as attested by curtains at the window; but there were no lights 3
within, and I passed it without disaster. 3
3
In Babson Street, which crossed Federal and might thus reveal me to the 3
searchers, I clung as closely as possible to the sagging, uneven buildings; twice 3
pausing in a doorway as the noises behind me momentarily increased. The open 3
space ahead shone wide and desolate under the moon, but my route would not 3
force me to cross it. During my second pause I began to detect a fresh 3
distribution of vague sounds; and upon looking cautiously out from cover 3
beheld a motor car darting across the open space, bound outward along Eliot 3
Street, which there intersects both Babson and Lafayette. 3
3
As I watched - choked by a sudden rise in the fishy odour after a short abatement 3
- I saw a band of uncouth, crouching shapes loping and shambling in the same 3
direction; and knew that this must be the party guarding the Ipswich road, since 3
that highway forms an extension of Eliot Street. Two of the figures I glimpsed 3
were in voluminous robes, and one wore a peaked diadem which glistened 3
whitely in the moonlight. The gait of this figure was so odd that it sent a chill 3
through me - for it seemed to me the creature was almost hopping. 3
3
When the last of the band was out of sight I resumed my progress; darting 3
around the corner into Lafayette Street, and crossing Eliot very hurriedly lest 3
stragglers of the party be still advancing along that thoroughfare. I did hear some 3
croaking and clattering sounds far off toward Town Square, but accomplished 3
the passage without disaster. My greatest dread was in re-crossing broad and 3
moonlit South Street - with its seaward view - and I had to nerve myself for the 3
ordeal. Someone might easily be looking, and possible Eliot Street stragglers 3
could not fail to glimpse me from either of two points. At the last moment I 3
decided I had better slacken my trot and make the crossing as before in the 3
shambling gait of an average Innsmouth native. 3
3
When the view of the water again opened out - this time on my right - I was half- 3
determined not to look at it at all. I could not however, resist; but cast a sidelong 3
glance as I carefully and imitatively shambled toward the protecting shadows 3
ahead. There was no ship visible, as I had half-expected there would be. Instead, 3
the first thing which caught my eye was a small rowboat pulling in toward the 3
abandoned wharves and laden with some bulky, tarpaulin-covered object. Its 3
rowers, though distantly and indistinctly seen, were of an especially repellent 3
aspect. Several swimmers were still discernible; while on the far black reef I 3
could see a faint, steady glow unlike the winking beacon visible before, and of a 3
3
3
3
796 3
3
3
3
curious colour which I could not precisely identify. Above the slant roofs ahead 3
and to the right there loomed the tall cupola of the Gilman House, but it was 3
completely dark. The fishy odour, dispelled for a moment by some merciful 3
breeze, now closed in again with maddening intensity. 3
3
I had not quite crossed the street when I heard a muttering band advancing 3
along Washington from the north. As they reached the broad open space where I 3
had had my first disquieting glimpse of the moonlit water I could see them 3
plainly only a block away - and was horrified by the bestial abnormality of their 3
faces and the doglike sub-humanness of their crouching gait. One man moved in 3
a positively simian way, with long arms frequently touching the ground; while 3
another figure - robed and tiaraed - seemed to progress in an almost hopping 3
fashion. I judged this party to be the one I had seen in the Gilman's courtyard - 3
the one, therefore, most closely on my trail. As some of the figures turned to look 3
in my direction I was transfixed with fright, yet managed to preserve the casual, 3
shambling gait I had assumed. To this day I do not know whether they saw me 3
or not. If they did, my stratagem must have deceived them, for they passed on 3
across the moonlit space without varying their course - meanwhile croaking and 3
jabbering in some hateful guttural patois I could not identify. 3
3
Once more in shadow, I resumed my former dog-trot past the leaning and 3
decrepit houses that stared blankly into the night. Having crossed to the western 3
sidewalk I rounded the nearest corner into Bates Street where I kept close to the 3
buildings on the southern side. I passed two houses shewing signs of habitation, 3
one of which had faint lights in upper rooms, yet met with no obstacle. As I 3
tuned into Adams Street I felt measurably safer, but received a shook when a 3
man reeled out of a black doorway directly in front of me. He proved, however, 3
too hopelessly drunk to be a menace; so that I reached the dismal ruins of the 3
Bank Street warehouses in safety. 3
3
No one was stirring in that dead street beside the river-gorge, and the roar of the 3
waterfalls quite drowned my foot steps. It was a long dog-trot to the ruined 3
station, and the great brick warehouse walls around me seemed somehow more 3
terrifying than the fronts of private houses. At last I saw the ancient arcaded 3
station - or what was left of it - and made directly for the tracks that started from 3
its farther end. 3
3
The rails were rusty but mainly intact, and not more than half the ties had rotted 3
away. Walking or running on such a surface was very difficult; but I did my best, 3
and on the whole made very fair time. For some distance the line kept on along 3
the gorge's brink, but at length I reached the long covered bridge where it 3
crossed the chasm at a dizzying height. The condition of this bridge would 3
3
3
3
797 3
3
3
3
determine my next step. If humanly possible, I would use it; if not, 1 would have 3
to risk more street wandering and take the nearest intact highway bridge. 3
3
The vast, barnlike length of the old bridge gleamed spectrally in the moonlight, 3
and I saw that the ties were safe for at least a few feet within. Entering, I began to 3
use my flashlight, and was almost knocked down by the cloud of bats that 3
flapped past me. About half-way across there was a perilous gap in the ties 3
which I feared for a moment would halt me; but in the end I risked a desperate 3
jump which fortunately succeeded. 3
3
I was glad to see the moonlight again when I emerged from that macabre tunnel. 3
The old tracks crossed River Street at grade, and at once veered off into a region 3
increasingly rural and with less and less of Innsmouth's abhorrent fishy odour. 3
Here the dense growth of weeds and briers hindered me and cruelly tore at my 3
clothes, but I was none the less glad that they were there to give me concealment 3
in case of peril. I knew that much of my route must be visible from the Rowley 3
road. 3
3
The marshy region began very abruptly, with the single track on a low, grassy 3
embankment where the weedy growth was somewhat thinner. Then came a sort 3
of island of higher ground, where the line passed through a shallow open cut 3
choked with bushes and brambles. I was very glad of this partial shelter, since at 3
this point the Rowley road was uncomfortably near according to my window 3
view. At the end of the cut it would cross the track and swerve off to a safer 3
distance; but meanwhile I must be exceedingly careful. I was by this time 3
thankfully certain that the railway itself was not patrolled. 3
3
Just before entering the cut I glanced behind me, but saw no pursuer. The ancient 3
spires and roofs of decaying Innsmouth gleamed lovely and ethereal in the magic 3
yellow moonlight, and I thought of how they must have looked in the old days 3
before the shadow fell. Then, as my gaze circled inland from the town, 3
something less tranquil arrested my notice and held me immobile for a second. 3
3
What I saw - or fancied I saw - was a disturbing suggestion of undulant motion 3
far to the south; a suggestion which made me conclude that a very large horde 3
must be pouring out of the city along the level Ipswich road. The distance was 3
great and I could distinguish nothing in detail; but I did not at all like the look of 3
that moving column. It undulated too much, and glistened too brightly in the 3
rays of the now westering moon. There was a suggestion of sound, too, though 3
the wind was blowing the other way - a suggestion of bestial scraping and 3
bellowing even worse than the muttering of the parties I had lately overheard. 3
3
3
3

3
3
3
All sorts of unpleasant conjectures crossed my mind. I thought of those very 3
extreme Innsmouth types said to be hidden in crumbling, centuried warrens near 3
the waterfront; I thought, too, of those nameless swimmers I had seen. Counting 3
the parties so far glimpsed, as well as those presumably covering other roads, the 3
number of my pursuers must be strangely large for a town as depopulated as 3
Innsmouth. 3
3
Whence could come the dense personnel of such a column as I now beheld? Did 3
those ancient, unplumbed warrens teem with a twisted, uncatalogued, and 3
unsuspected life? Or had some unseen ship indeed landed a legion of unknown 3
outsiders on that hellish reef? Who were they? Why were they here? And if such 3
a column of them was scouring the Ipswich road, would the patrols on the other 3
roads be likewise augmented? 3
3
I had entered the brush-grown cut and was struggling along at a very slow pace 3
when that damnable fishy odour again waxed dominant. Had the wind suddenly 3
changed eastward, so that it blew in from the sea and over the town? It must 3
have, I concluded, since I now began to hear shocking guttural murmurs from 3
that hitherto silent direction. There was another sound, too - a kind of wholesale, 3
colossal flopping or pattering which somehow called up images of the most 3
detestable sort. It made me think illogically of that unpleasantly undulating 3
column on the far-off Ipswich road. 3
3
And then both stench and sounds grew stronger, so that I paused shivering and 3
grateful for the cut's protection. It was here, I recalled, that the Rowley road 3
drew so close to the old railway before crossing westward and diverging. 3
Something was coming along that road, and I must lie low till its passage and 3
vanishment in the distance. Thank heaven these creatures employed no dogs for 3
tracking - though perhaps that would have been impossible amidst the 3
omnipresent regional odour. Crouched in the bushes of that sandy cleft I felt 3
reasonably safe, even though I knew the searchers would have to cross the track 3
in front of me not much more than a hundred yards away. I would be able to see 3
them, but they could not, except by a malign miracle, see me. 3
3
All at once I began dreading to look at them as they passed. I saw the close 3
moonlit space where they would surge by, and had curious thoughts about the 3
irredeemable pollution of that space. They would perhaps be the worst of all 3
Innsmouth types - something one would not care to remember. 3
3
The stench waxed overpowering, and the noises swelled to a bestial babel of 3
croaking, baying and barking without the least suggestion of human speech. 3
Were these indeed the voices of my pursuers? Did they have dogs after all? So 3
far I had seen none of the lower animals in Innsmouth. That flopping or pattering 3
3
3
3
799 3
3
3
3
was monstrous - 1 could not look upon the degenerate creatures responsible for 3
it. I would keep my eyes shut till the sound receded toward the west. The horde 3
was very close now - air foul with their hoarse snarlings, and the ground almost 3
shaking with their alien-rhythmed footfalls. My breath nearly ceased to come, 3
and I put every ounce of will-power into the task of holding my eyelids down. 3
3
I am not even yet willing to say whether what followed was a hideous actuality 3
or only a nightmare hallucination. The later action of the government, after my 3
frantic appeals, would tend to confirm it as a monstrous truth; but could not an 3
hallucination have been repeated under the quasi-hypnotic spell of that ancient, 3
haunted, and shadowed town? Such places have strange properties, and the 3
legacy of insane legend might well have acted on more than one human 3
imagination amidst those dead, stench-cursed streets and huddles of rotting 3
roofs and crumbling steeples. Is it not possible that the germ of an actual 3
contagious madness lurks in the depths of that shadow over Innsmouth? Who 3
can be sure of reality after hearing things like the tale of old Zadok Allen? The 3
government men never found poor Zadok, and have no conjectures to make as to 3
what became of him. Where does madness leave off and reality begin? Is it 3
possible that even my latest fear is sheer delusion? 3
3
But I must try to tell what I thought I saw that night under the mocking yellow 3
moon - saw surging and hopping down the Rowley road in plain sight in front of 3
me as I crouched among the wild brambles of that desolate railway cut. Of 3
course my resolution to keep my eyes shut had failed. It was foredoomed to 3
failure - for who could crouch blindly while a legion of croaking, baying entities 3
of unknown source flopped noisomely past, scarcely more than a hundred yards 3
away? 3
3
I thought I was prepared for the worst, and I really ought to have been prepared 3
considering what I had seen before. 3
3
My other pursuers had been accursedly abnormal - so should I not have been 3
ready to face a strengthening of the abnormal element; to look upon forms in 3
which there was no mixture of the normal at all? I did not open my eyes until the 3
raucous clamour came loudly from a point obviously straight ahead. Then I 3
knew that a long section of them must be plainly in sight where the sides of the 3
cut flattened out and the road crossed the track - and I could no longer keep 3
myself from sampling whatever honor that leering yellow moon might have to 3
shew. 3
3
It was the end, for whatever remains to me of life on the surface of this earth, of 3
every vestige of mental peace and confidence in the integrity of nature and of the 3
human mind. Nothing that I could have imagined - nothing, even, that I could 3
3
3
3
800 3
3
3
3
have gathered had I credited old Zadok's crazy tale in the most literal way - 3
would be in any way comparable to the demoniac, blasphemous reality that I 3
saw - or believe I saw. I have tied to hint what it was in order to postpone the 3
horror of writing it down baldly. Can it be possible that this planet has actually 3
spawned such things; that human eyes have truly seen, as objective flesh, what 3
man has hitherto known only in febrile phantasy and tenuous legend? 3
3
And yet I saw them in a limitless stream - flopping, hopping, croaking, bleating - 3
urging inhumanly through the spectral moonlight in a grotesque, malignant 3
saraband of fantastic nightmare. And some of them had tall tiaras of that 3
nameless whitish-gold metal . . . and some were strangely robed . . . and one, who 3
led the way, was clad in a ghoulishly humped black coat and striped trousers, 3
and had a man's felt hat perched on the shapeless thing that answered for a 3
head. 3
3
I think their predominant colour was a greyish-green, though they had white 3
bellies. They were mostly shiny and slippery, but the ridges of their backs were 3
scaly. Their forms vaguely suggested the anthropoid, while their heads were the 3
heads of fish, with prodigious bulging eyes that never closed. At the sides of 3
their necks were palpitating gills, and their long paws were webbed. They 3
hopped irregularly, sometimes on two legs and sometimes on four. I was 3
somehow glad that they had no more than four limbs. Their croaking, baying 3
voices, clearly wed tar articulate speech, held all the dark shades of expression 3
which their staring faces lacked. 3
3
But for all of their monstrousness they were not unfamiliar to me. I knew too 3
well what they must be - for was not the memory of the evil tiara at 3
Newburyport still fresh? They were the blasphemous fish-frogs of the nameless 3
design - living and horrible - and as I saw them I knew also of what that 3
humped, tiaraed priest in the black church basement had fearsomely reminded 3
me. Their number was past guessing. It seemed to me that there were limitless 3
swarms of them and certainly my momentary glimpse could have shewn only 3
the least fraction. In another instant everything was blotted out by a merciful fit 3
of fainting; the first I had ever had. 3
3
V 3
3
It was a gentle daylight rain that awaked me front my stupor in the brush-grown 3
railway cut, and when I staggered out to the roadway ahead I saw no trace of 3
any prints in the fresh mud. The fishy odour, too, was gone, Innsmouth's ruined 3
roofs and toppling steeples loomed up greyly toward the southeast, but not a 3
living creature did I spy in all the desolate salt marshes around. My watch was 3
still going, and told me that the hour was past noon. 3
3
3
3
801 3
3
3
3
The reality of what I had been through was highly uncertain in my mind, but I 3
felt that something hideous lay in the background. I must get away from evil- 3
shadowed Innsmouth - and accordingly I began to test my cramped, wearied 3
powers of locomotion. Despite weakness hunger, horror, and bewilderment I 3
found myself after a time able to walk; so started slowly along the muddy road 3
to Rowley. Before evening I was in village, getting a meal and providing myself 3
with presentable cloths. I caught the night train to Arkham, and the next day 3
talked long and earnestly with government officials there; a process I later 3
repeated in Boston. With the main result of these colloquies the public is now 3
familiar - and I wish, for normality's sake, there were nothing more to tell. 3
Perhaps it is madness that is overtaking me - yet perhaps a greater horror - or a 3
greater marvel - is reaching out. 3
3
As may well be imagined, I gave up most of the foreplanned features of the rest 3
of my tour - the scenic, architectural, and antiquarian diversions on which I had 3
counted so heavily. Nor did I dare look for that piece of strange jewelry said to 3
be in the Miskatonic University Museum. I did, however, improve my stay in 3
Arkham by collecting some genealogical notes I had long wished to possess; very 3
rough and hasty data, it is true, but capable of good use later no when I might 3
have time to collate and codify them. The curator of the historical society there - 3
Mr. B. Lapham Peabody - was very courteous about assisting me, and expressed 3
unusual interest when I told him I was a grandson of Eliza Orne of Arkham, who 3
was born in 1867 and had married James Williamson of Ohio at the age of 3
seventeen. 3
3
It seemed that a material uncle of mine had been there many years before on a 3
quest much like my own; and that my grandmother's family was a topic of some 3
local curiosity. There had, Mr. Peabody said, been considerable discussion about 3
the marriage of her father, Benjamin Orne, just after the Civil War; since the 3
ancestry of the bride was peculiarly puzzling. That bride was understood to have 3
been an orphaned Marsh of New Hampshire - a cousin of the Essex County 3
Marshes - but her education had been in France and she knew very little of her 3
family. A guardian had deposited funds in a Boston bank to maintain her and 3
her French governess; but that guardian's name was unfamiliar to Arkham 3
people, and in time he dropped out of sight, so that the governess assumed the 3
role by court appointment. The Frenchwoman - now long dead - was very 3
taciturn, and there were those who said she would have told more than she did. 3
3
But the most baffling thing was the inability of anyone to place the recorded 3
parents of the young woman - Enoch and Lydia (Meserve) Marsh - among the 3
known families of New Hampshire. Possibly, many suggested, she was the 3
natural daughter of some Marsh of prominence - she certainly had the true 3
Marsh eyes. Most of the puzzling was done after her early death, which took 3
3
3
3
802 3
3
3
3
place at the birth of my grandmother - her only child. Having formed some 3
disagreeable impressions connected with the name of Marsh, I did not welcome 3
the news that it belonged on my own ancestral tree; nor was I pleased by Mr. 3
Peabody's suggestion that I had the true Marsh eyes myself. However, I was 3
grateful for data which I knew would prove valuable; and took copious notes 3
and lists of book references regarding the well-documented Orne family. 3
3
I went directly home to Toledo from Boston, and later spent a month at Maumee 3
recuperating from my ordeal. In September I entered Oberlin for my final year, 3
and from then till the next June was busy with studies and other wholesome 3
activities - reminded of the bygone terror only by occasional official visits from 3
government men in connexion with the campaign which my pleas and evidence 3
had started. Around the middle of July - just a year after the Innsmouth 3
experience - I spent a week with my late mother's family in Cleveland; checking 3
some of my new genealogical data with the various notes, traditions, and bits of 3
heirloom material in existence there, and seeing what kind of a connected chart I 3
could construct. 3
3
I did not exactly relish this task, for the atmosphere of the Williamson home had 3
always depressed me. There was a strain of morbidity there, and my mother had 3
never encouraged my visiting her parents as a child, although she always 3
welcomed her father when he came to Toledo. My Arkham-born grandmother 3
had seemed strange and almost terrifying to me, and I do not think I grieved 3
when she disappeared. I was eight years old then, and it was said that she had 3
wandered off in grief after the suicide of my Uncle Douglas, her eldest son. He 3
had shot himself after a trip to New England - the same trip, no doubt, which 3
had caused him to be recalled at the Arkham Historical Society. 3
3
This uncle had resembled her, and I had never liked him either. Something about 3
the staring, unwinking expression of both of them had given me a vague, 3
unaccountable uneasiness. My mother and Uncle Walter had not looked like that. 3
They were like their father, though poor little cousin Lawrence - Walter's son - 3
had been almost perfect duplicate of his grandmother before his condition took 3
him to the permanent seclusion of a sanitarium at Canton. I had not seen him in 3
four years, but my uncle once implied that his state, both mental and physical, 3
was very bad. This worry had probably been a major cause of his mother's death 3
two years before. 3
3
My grandfather and his widowed son Walter now comprised the Cleveland 3
household, but the memory of older times hung thickly over it. I still disliked the 3
place, and tried to get my researches done as quickly as possible. Williamson 3
records and traditions were supplied in abundance by my grandfather; though 3
for Orne material I had to depend on my uncle Walter, who put at my disposal 3
3
3
3
803 3
3
3
3
the contents of all his files, including notes, letters, cuttings, heirlooms, 3
photographs, and miniatures. 3
3
It was in going over the letters and pictures on the Orne side that I began to 3
acquire a kind of terror of my own ancestry. As I have said, my grandmother and 3
Uncle Douglas had always disturbed me. Now, years after their passing, I gazed 3
at their pictured faces with a measurably heightened feeling of repulsion and 3
alienation. I could not at first understand the change, but gradually a horrible 3
sort of comparison began to obtrude itself on my unconscious mind despite the 3
steady refusal of my consciousness to admit even the least suspicion of it. It was 3
clear that the typical expression of these faces now suggested something it had 3
not suggested before - something which would bring stark panic if too openly 3
thought of. 3
3
But the worst shock came when my uncle shewed me the Orne jewellery in a 3
downtown safe deposit vault. Some of the items were delicate and inspiring 3
enough, but there was one box of strange old pieces descended from my 3
mysterious great-grandmother which my uncle was almost reluctant to produce. 3
They were, he said, of very grotesque and almost repulsive design, and had 3
never to his knowledge been publicly worn; though my grandmother used to 3
enjoy looking at them. Vague legends of bad luck clustered around them, and 3
my great-grandmother's French governess had said they ought not to be worn in 3
New England, though it would be quite safe to wear them in Europe. 3
3
As my uncle began slowly and grudgingly to unwrap the things he urged me not 3
to be shocked by the strangeness and frequent hideousness of the designs. Artists 3
and archaeologists who had seen them pronounced their workmanship 3
superlatively and exotically exquisite, though no one seemed able to define their 3
exact material or assign them to any specific art tradition. There were two 3
armlets, a tiara, and a kind of pectoral; the latter having in high relief certain 3
figures of almost unbearable extravagance. 3
3
During this description I had kept a tight rein on my emotions, but my face must 3
have betrayed my mounting fears. My uncle looked concerned, and paused in 3
his unwrapping to study my countenance. I motioned to him to continue, which 3
he did with renewed signs of reluctance. He seemed to expect some 3
demonstration when the first piece - the tiara - became visible, but I doubt if he 3
expected quite what actually happened. I did not expect it, either, for I thought I 3
was thoroughly forewarned regarding what the jewellery would turn out to be. 3
What I did was to faint silently away, just as I had done in that brier choked 3
railway cut a year before. 3
3
3
3
804 3
3
3
3
From that day on my life has been a nightmare of brooding and apprehension 3
nor do I know how much is hideous truth and how much madness. My great- 3
grandmother had been a Marsh of unknown source whose husband Hved in 3
Arkham - and did not old Zadok say that the daughter of Obed Marsh by a 3
monstrous mother was married to an Arkham man trough trick? What was it the 3
ancient toper had muttered about the line of my eyes to Captain Obed's? In 3
Arkham, too, the curator had told me I had the true Marsh eyes. Was Obed 3
Marsh my own great-great-grandfather? Who - or what - then, was my great- 3
great-grandmother? But perhaps this was all madness. Those whitish-gold 3
ornaments might easily have been bought from some Innsmouth sailor by the 3
father of my great-grand-mother, whoever he was. And that look in the staring- 3
eyed faces of my grandmother and self-slain uncle might be sheer fancy on my 3
part - sheer fancy, bolstered up by the Innsmouth shadow which had so darkly 3
coloured my imagination. But why had my uncle killed himself after an ancestral 3
quest in New England? 3
3
For more than two years 1 fought off these reflections with partial success. My 3
father secured me a place in an insurance office, and I buried myself in routine as 3
deeply as possible. In the winter of 1930-31, however, the dreams began. They 3
were very sparse and insidious at first, but increased in frequency and vividness 3
as the weeks went by. Great watery spaces opened out before me, and I seemed 3
to wander through titanic sunken porticos and labyrinths of weedy Cyclopean 3
walls with grotesque fishes as my companions. Then the other shapes began to 3
appear, filling me with nameless horror the moment I awoke. But during the 3
dreams they did not horrify me at all - I was one with them; wearing their 3
unhuman trappings, treading their aqueous ways, and praying monstrously at 3
their evil sea-bottom temples. 3
3
There was much more than I could remember, but even what I did remember 3
each morning would be enough to stamp me as a madman or a genius if ever I 3
dared write it down. Some frightful influence, I felt, was seeking gradually to 3
drag me out of the sane world of wholesome life into unnamable abysses of 3
blackness and alienage; and the process told heavily on me. My health and 3
appearance grew steadily worse, till finally I was forced to give up my position 3
and adopt the static, secluded life of an invalid. Some odd nervous affliction had 3
me in its grip, and I found myself at times almost unable to shut my eyes. 3
3
It was then that I began to study the mirror with mounting alarm. The slow 3
ravages of disease are not pleasant to watch, but in my case there was something 3
subtler and more puzzling in the background. My father seemed to notice it, too, 3
for he began looking at me curiously and almost affrightedly. What was taking 3
place in me? Could it be that I was coming to resemble my grandmother and 3
uncle Douglas? 3
3
3
3
805 3
3
3
3
One night I had a frightful dream in which I met my grandmother under the sea. 3
She hved in a phosphorescent palace of many terraces, with gardens of strange 3
leprous corals and grotesque brachiate efflorescences, and welcomed me with a 3
warmth that may have been sardonic. She had changed - as those who take to the 3
water change - and told me she had never died. Instead, she had gone to a spot 3
her dead son had learned about, and had leaped to a realm whose wonders - 3
destined for him as well - he had spurned with a smoking pistol. This was to be 3
my realm, too - I could not escape it. I would never die, but would live with 3
those who had lived since before man ever walked the earth. 3
3
I met also that which had been her grandmother. For eighty thousand years 3
Pth'thya-l'yi had lived in Y'ha-nthlei, and thither she had gone back after Obed 3
Marsh was dead. Y'ha-nthlei was not destroyed when the upper-earth men shot 3
death into the sea. It was hurt, but not destroyed. The Deep Ones could never be 3
destroyed, even though the palaeogean magic of the forgotten Old Ones might 3
sometimes check them. For the present they would rest; but some day, if they 3
remembered, they would rise again for the tribute Great Cthulhu craved. It 3
would be a city greater than Innsmouth next time. They had planned to spread, 3
and had brought up that which would help them, but now they must wait once 3
more. For bringing the upper-earth men's death I must do a penance, but that 3
would not be heavy. This was the dream in which I saw a shoggoth for the first 3
time, and the sight set me awake in a frenzy of screaming. That morning the 3
mirror definitely told me I had acquired the Innsmouth look. 3
3
So far I have not shot myself as my uncle Douglas did. I bought an automatic and 3
almost took the step, but certain dreams deterred me. The tense extremes of 3
horror are lessening, and I feel queerly drawn toward the unknown sea-deeps 3
instead of fearing them. I hear and do strange things in sleep, and awake with a 3
kind of exaltation instead of terror. I do not believe I need to wait for the full 3
change as most have waited. If I did, my father would probably shut me up in a 3
sanitarium as my poor little cousin is shut up. Stupendous and unheard-of 3
splendors await me below, and I shall seek them soon. la-R'lyehl Cihuiha flgagnl 3
id la! No, I shall not shoot myself - I cannot be made to shoot myself! 3
3
I shall plan my cousin's escape from that Canton mad-house, and together we 3
shall go to marvel-shadowed Innsmouth. We shall swim out to that brooding 3
reef in the sea and dive down through black abysses to Cyclopean and many- 3
columned Y'ha-nthlei, and in that lair of the Deep Ones we shall dwell amidst 3
wonder and glory for ever. 3

The Shunned House 3
3
Written October 1924 3
3
3
3
From even the greatest of horrors irony is seldom absent. Some times it enters 3
directly into the composition of the events, while sometimes it relates only to 3
their fortuitous position among persons and places. The latter sort is splendidly 3
exemplified by a case in the ancient city of Providence, where in the late forties 3
Edgar Allan Poe used to sojourn often during his unsuccessful wooing of the 3
gifted poetess, Mrs. Whitman. Poe generally stopped at the Mansion House in 3
Benefit Street - the renamed Golden Ball Inn whose roof has sheltered 3
Washington, Jefferson, and Lafayette - and his favourite walk led northward 3
along the same street to Mrs. Whitman's home and the neighbouring hillside 3
churchyard of St. John's whose hidden expanse of eighteenth-century 3
gravestones had for him a peculiar fascination. 3
3
Now the irony is this. In this walk, so many times repeated, the world's greatest 3
master of the terrible and the bizarre was obliged to pass a particular house on 3
the eastern side of the street; a dingy, antiquated structure perched on the 3
abruptly rising side hill, with a great unkept yard dating from a time when the 3
region was partly open country. It does not appear that he ever wrote or spoke of 3
it, nor is there any evidence that he even noticed it. And yet that house, to the 3
two persons in possession of certain information, equals or outranks in horror 3
the wildest phantasy of the genius who so often passed it unknowingly, and 3
stands starkly leering as a symbol of all that is unutterably hideous. 3
3
The house was - and for that matter still is - of a kind to attract the attention of 3
the curious. Originally a farm or semi-farm building, it followed the average 3
New England colonial lines of the middle eighteenth century - the prosperous 3
peaked-roof sort, with two stories and dormerless attic, and with the Georgian 3
doorway and interior paneling dictated by the progress of taste at that time. It 3
faced south, with one gable and buried to the lower windows in the east ward 3
rising hill, and the other exposed to the foundations toward the street. Its 3
construction, over a century and a half ago, had followed the grading and 3
straightening of the road in that especial vicinity; for Benefit Street - at first called 3
Back Street - was laid out as a lane winding amongst the graveyards of the first 3
settlers, and straightened only when the removal of the bodies to the North 3
Burial Ground made it decently possible to cut through the old family plots. 3
3
3
3
807 3
3
3
3
At the start, the western wall had lain some twenty feet up a precipitous lawn 3
from the roadway; but a widening of the street at about the time of the 3
Revolution sheared off most of the intervening space, exposing the foundations 3
so that a brick basement wall had to be made, giving the deep cellar a street 3
frontage with the door and two windows above ground, close to the new line of 3
public travel. When the sidewalk was laid out a century ago the last of the 3
intervening space was removed; and Poe in his walks must have seen only a 3
sheer ascent of dull grey brick flush with the sidewalk and surmounted at a 3
height of ten feet by the antique shingled bulk of the house proper. 3
3
The farm-like grounds extended back very deeply up the hill, al most to 3
Wheaton Street. The space south of the house, abutting on Benefit Street, was of 3
course greatly above the existing sidewalk level, forming a terrace bounded by a 3
high bank wall of damp, mossy stone pierced by a steep flight of narrow steps 3
which led inward be tween canyon-like surfaces to the upper region of mangy 3
lawn, rheumy brick walls, and neglected gardens whose dismantled cement 3
urns, rusted kettles fallen from tripods of knotty sticks, and similar 3
paraphernalia set off the weather beaten front door with its broken fanlight, 3
rotting Ionic pilasters, and wormy triangular pediment. 3
3
What I heard in my youth about the shunned house was merely that people died 3
there in alarmingly great numbers. That, I was told, was why the original owners 3
had moved out some twenty years after building the place. It was plainly 3
unhealthy, perhaps because of the dampness and fungous growth in the cellar, 3
the general sickish smell, the draughts of the hallways, or the quality of the well 3
and pump water. These things were bad enough, and these were all that gained 3
belief among the person whom I knew. Only the notebooks of my antiquarian 3
uncle. Dr. Elihu Whipple, revealed to me at length the darker, vaguer surmises 3
which formed an undercurrent of folk- 3
lore among old-time servants and humble folk, surmises which never travelled 3
far, and which were largely forgotten when Providence grew to be a metropolis 3
with a shifting modern population. 3
3
The general fact is, that the house was never regarded by the solid part of the 3
community as in any real sense "haunted." There were no widespread tales of 3
rattling chains, cold currents of air, extinguished lights, or faces at the window. 3
Extremists sometimes said the house was "unlucky," but that is as far as even 3
they went. What was really beyond dispute is that a frightful proportion of 3
persons died there; or more accurately, had died there, since after some peculiar 3
happenings over sixty years ago the building had become deserted through the 3
sheer impossibility of renting it. These persons were not all cut off suddenly by 3
any one cause; rather did it seem that their vitality was insidiously sapped, so 3
3
3
3
808 3
3
3
3
that each one died the sooner from whatever tendency to weakness he may have 3
naturally had. And those who did not die displayed in varying degree a type of 3
anaemia or consumption, and sometimes a decline of the mental faculties, which 3
spoke ill for the salubriousness of the building. Neighbouring houses, it must be 3
added, seemed entirely free from the noxious quality. 3
3
This much I knew before my insistent questioning led my uncle to show me the 3
notes which finally embarked us both on our hideous investigation. In my 3
childhood the shunned house was vacant, with barren, gnarled and terrible old 3
trees, long, queerly pale grass and nightmarishly misshapen weeds in the high 3
terraced yard where birds never lingered. We boys used to overrun the place, 3
and I can still recall my youthful terror not only at the morbid strangeness of this 3
sinister vegetation, but at the eldritch atmosphere and odour of the dilapidated 3
house, whose unlocked front door was often entered in quest of shudders. The 3
small-paned windows were largely broken, and a nameless air of desolation 3
hung round the precarious panel ling, shaky interior shutters, peeling 3
wallpaper,, falling plaster, rickety staircases, and such fragments of battered 3
furniture as still remained. The dust and cobwebs added their touch of the 3
fearful; and brave indeed was the boy who would voluntarily ascend the ladder 3
to the attic, a vast raftered length lighted only by small blinking windows in the 3
gable ends, and filled with a massed wreckage of chests, chairs, and spinning- 3
wheels which infinite years of deposit had shrouded and festooned into 3
monstrous and hellish shapes. 3
3
But after all, the attic was not the most terrible part of the house. It was the dank, 3
humid cellar which somehow exerted the strongest repulsion on us, even though 3
it was wholly above ground on the street side, with only a thin door and 3
window-pierced brick wall to separate it from the busy sidewalk. We scarcely 3
knew whether to haunt it in spectral fascination, or to shun it for the sake of our 3
souls and our sanity. For one thing, the bad odour of the house was strongest 3
there; and for another thing, we did not like the white fungous growths which 3
occasionally sprang up in rainy summer weather from the hard earth floor. 3
Those fungi, grotesquely like the vegetation in the yard outside, were truly 3
horrible in their outlines; detest able parodies of toadstools and Indian pipes, 3
whose like we had never seen in any other situation. They rotted quickly, and at 3
one stage became slightly phosphorescent; so that nocturnal passers-by 3
sometimes spoke of witch-fires glowing behind the broken panes of the foetor- 3
spreading windows. 3
3
We never - even in our wildest Hallowe'en moods - visited this cellar by night, 3
but in some of our daytime visits could detect the phosphorescence, especially 3
when the day was dark and wet. There was also a subtler thing we often thought 3
we detected - a very strange thing which was, however, merely suggestive at 3
3
3
3
809 3
3
3
3
most. I refer to a sort of cloudy whitish pattern on the dirt floor - a vague, 3
shifting deposit of mould or nitre which we sometimes thought we could trace 3
amidst the sparse fungous growths near the huge fireplace of the basement 3
kitchen. Once in a while it struck us that this patch bore an uncanny resemblance 3
to a doubled-up human figure, though generally no such kinship existed, and 3
often there was no whitish deposit whatever. .On a certain rainy afternoon when 3
this illusion seemed phenomenally strong, and when, in addition, I had fancied I 3
glimpsed a kind of thin, yellowish, shimmering exhalation rising from the 3
nitrous pattern toward the yawning fireplace, I spoke to my uncle about the 3
matter. He smiled at this odd conceit, but it seemed that his smile was tinged 3
with reminiscence. Later I heard that a similar notion entered into some of the 3
wild ancient tales of the common folk - a notion likewise alluding to ghoulish, 3
wolfish shapes taken by smoke from the great chimney, and queer contours 3
assumed by certain of the sinuous tree-roots that thrust their way into the cellar 3
through the loose foundation-stones. 3
3
II 3
3
Not till my adult years did my uncle set before me the notes and data which he 3
had collected concerning the shunned house. Dr. Whipple was a sane, 3
conservative physician of the old school, and for all his interest in the place was 3
not eager to encourage young thoughts toward the abnormal. His own view, 3
postulating simply a building and location of markedly unsanitary qualities, had 3
nothing to do with abnormality; but he realized that the very picturesque ness 3
which aroused his own interest would in a boy's fanciful mind take on all 3
manner of gruesome imaginative associations. 3
3
The doctor was a bachelor; a white-haired, clean-shaven, old- fashioned 3
gentleman, and a local historian of note, who had often broken a lance with such 3
controversial guardians of tradition as Sidney S. Rider and Thomas W. Bicknell. 3
He lived with one man servant in a Georgian homestead with knocker and iron- 3
railed steps, balanced eerily on the steep ascent of North Court Street beside the 3
ancient brick court and colony house where his grandfather - a cousin of that 3
celebrated privateersman, Capt. Whipple, who burnt His Majesty's armed 3
schooner Gaspee in 1772 - had voted in the legislature on May 4, 1776, for the 3
independence of the Rhode Island Colony. Around him in the damp, low-ceiled 3
library with the musty white paneling, heavy carved overmantel and small- 3
paned, vine- shaded windows, were the relics and records of his ancient family, 3
among which were many dubious allusions to the shunned house in Benefit 3
Street. That pest spot lies not far. distant - for Benefit runs ledgewise just above 3
the court house along the precipitous hill up which the first settlement climbed. 3

3
3
When, in the end, my insistent pestering and maturing years evoked from my 3
uncle the hoarded lore I sought, there lay before me a strange enough chronicle. 3
Long-winded, statistical, and drearily genealogical as some of the matter was, 3
there ran through it a continuous thread of brooding, tenacious horror and 3
preternatural malevolence which impressed me even more than it had impressed 3
the good doctor. Separate events fitted together uncannily, and seemingly 3
irrelevant details held mines of hideous possibilities. A new and burning 3
curiosity grew in me, compared to which my boyish curiosity was feeble and 3
inchoate. The first revelation led to an exhaustive research, and finally to that 3
shuddering quest which proved so disastrous to myself and mine. For at last my 3
uncle insisted on joining the search I had commenced, and after a certain night in 3
that house he did not come away with me. I am lonely without that gentle soul 3
whose long years were filled only with honour, virtue, good taste, benevolence, 3
and learning. I have reared a marble urn to his memory in St. John's churchyard - 3
the place that Poe loved - the hidden grove of giant willows on the hill, where 3
tombs and head stones huddle quietly between the hoary bulk of the church and 3
the houses and bank walls of Benefit Street. 3
3
The history of the house, opening amidst a maze of dates, revealed no trace of 3
the sinister either about its construction or about the prosperous and honourable 3
family who built it. Yet from the first a taint of calamity, soon increased to 3
boding significance, was apparent. My uncle's carefully compiled record began 3
with the building of the structure in 1763, and followed the theme with an 3
unusual amount of detail. The shunned house, it seems, was first inhabited by 3
William Harris and his wife Rhoby Dexter, with their children, Elkanah, born in 3
1755, Abigail, born in 1757, William, Jr., born in 1759, and Ruth, born in 1761. 3
Harris was a substantial merchant and seaman in the West India trade, 3
connected with the firm of Obadiah Brown and his nephews. After Brown's 3
death in 1761, the new firm of Nicholas Brown & Co. made him master of the 3
brig Prudence, providence-built, of 120 tons, thus enabling him to erect the new 3
homestead he had desired ever since his marriage. 3
3
The site he had chosen - a recently straightened part of the new and fashionable 3
Back Street, which ran along the side of the hill above crowded Cheapside - was 3
all that could be wished, and the building did justice to the location. It was the 3
best that moderate means could afford, and Harris hastened to move in before 3
the birth of a fifth child which the family expected. That child, a boy, came in 3
December; but was still-born. Nor was any child to be born alive in that house 3
for a century and a half. 3
3
The next April sickness occurred among the children, and Abigail and Ruth died 3
before the month was over. Dr. Job Ives diagnosed the trouble as some infantile 3
fever, though others declared it was more of a mere wasting-away or decline. It 3
3
3
3
811 3
3
3
3
seemed, in any event, to be contagious; for Hannah Bowen, one of the two 3
servants, died of it in the following June. Eli Lideason, the other servant, 3
constantly complained of weakness; and would have returned to his father's 3
farm in Rehoboth but for a sudden attachment for Mehitabel Pierce, who was 3
hired to succeed Hannah. He died the next year - a sad year in deed, since it 3
marked the death of William Harris himself, enfeebled as he was by the climate 3
of Martinique, where his occupation had kept him for considerable periods 3
during the preceding decade. 3
3
The widowed Rhoby Harris never recovered from the shock of her husband's 3
death, and the passing of her firstborn Elkanah two years later was the final blow 3
to her reason. In 1768 she fell victim to a mild form of insanity, and was 3
thereafter confined to the upper part of the house, her elder maiden sister, Mercy 3
Dexter, having moved in to take charge of the family. Mercy was a plain, raw- 3
boned woman of great strength, but her health visibly declined from the time of 3
her advent. She was greatly devoted to her unfortunate sister, and had an 3
especial affection for her only surviving nephew William, who from a sturdy 3
infant had become a sickly, spindling lad. In 3
3
this year the servant Mehitabel died, and the other servant. Pre served Smith, left 3
without coherent explanation - or at least, with only some wild tales and a 3
complaint that he disliked the smell of the place. For a time Mercy could secure 3
no more help, since the seven deaths and case of madness, all occurring within 3
five years' space, had begun to set in motion the body of fireside rumour which 3
later became so bizarre. Ultimately, however, she obtained new servants from 3
out of town; Ann White, a morose woman from that part of North Kingstown 3
now set off as the township of Exeter, and a capable Boston man named Zenas 3
Low. 3
3
It was Ann White who first gave definite shape to the sinister idle talk. Mercy 3
should have known better than to hire anyone from the Nooseneck Hill country, 3
for that remote bit of backwoods was then, as now, a seat of the most 3
uncomfortable superstitions. As lately as 1892 an Exeter community exhumed a 3
dead body and ceremoniously burnt its heart in order to prevent certain alleged 3
visitations injurious to the public health and peace, and one may imagine the 3
point of view of the same section in 1768. Ann's tongue was perniciously active, 3
and within a few months Mercy discharged her, filling her place with a faithful 3
and amiable Amazon from Newport, Maria Robbins. 3
3
Meanwhile poor Rhoby Harris, in her madness, gave voice to dreams and 3
imaginings of the most hideous sort. At times her screams became insupportable, 3
and for long periods she would utter shrieking horrors which necessitated her 3
son's temporary residence with his cousin, Peleg Harris, in Presbyterian Lane 3
3
3
3
812 3
3
3
3
near the new college building. The boy would seem to improve after these visits, 3
and had Mercy been as wise as she was well-meaning, she would have let him 3
live permanently with Peleg. Just what Mrs. Harris cried out in her fits of 3
violence, tradition hesitates to say; or rather, presents such extravagant accounts 3
that they nullify themselves through sheer absurdity. Certainly it sounds absurd 3
to hear that a woman educated only in the rudiments of French often shouted for 3
hours in a coarse and idiomatic form of that language, or that the same per son, 3
alone and guarded, complained wildly of a staring thing which bit and chewed 3
at her. In 1772 the servant Zenas died, and when Mrs. Harris heard of it she 3
laughed with a shocking delight utterly foreign to her. The next year she herself 3
died, and was laid to rest in the North Burial Ground beside her husband. 3
3
Upon the outbreak of trouble with Great Britain in 1775, William Harris, despite 3
his scant sixteen years and feeble constitution, man aged to enlist in the Army of 3
Observation under General Greene; and from that time on enjoyed a steady rise 3
in health and prestige. 3
3
In 1780, as a Captain in Rhode Island forces in New Jersey under Colonel Angell, 3
he met and married Phebe Hetfield of Elizabethtown, whom he brought to 3
Providence upon his honourable discharge in the following year. 3
3
The young soldier's return was not a thing of unmitigated happiness. The house, 3
it is true, was still in good condition; and the street had been widened and 3
changed in name from Back Street to Benefit Street. But Mercy Dexter's once 3
robust frame had undergone a sag and curious decay, so that she was now a 3
stooped and pathetic figure with hollow voice and disconcerting pallor - 3
qualities shared to a singular degree by the one remaining servant Maria. In the 3
autumn of 1782 Phebe Harris gave birth to a still-born daughter, and on the 3
fifteenth of the next May Mercy Dexter took leave of a useful, austere, and 3
virtuous life. 3
3
William Harris, at last thoroughly convinced of the radically un healthful nature 3
of his abode, now took steps toward quitting it and closing it forever. Securing 3
temporary quarters for himself and wife at the newly opened Golden Ball Inn, he 3
arranged for the building of a new and finer house in Westminster Street, in the 3
growing part of the town across the Great Bridge. There, in 1785, his son Dutee 3
was born; and there the family dwelt till the encroachments of commerce drove 3
them back across the river and over the hill to Angell Street, in the newer East 3
Side residence district, where the late Archer Harris built his sumptuous but 3
hideous French-roofed mansion in 1876. William and Phebe both succumbed to 3
the yellow fever epidemic in 1797, but Dutee was brought up by his cousin 3
Rathbone Harris, Peleg's son. 3
3
3
3
813 3
3
3
3
Rathbone was a practical man, and rented the Benefit Street house despite 3
WiUiam's wish to keep it vacant. He considered it an obhgation to his ward to 3
make the most of all the boy's property, nor did he concern himself with the 3
deaths and illnesses which caused so many changes of tenants, or the steadily 3
growing aversion with which the house was generally regarded. It is likely that 3
he felt only vexation when, in 1804, the town council ordered him to fumigate the 3
place with sulphur, tar and gum camphor on account of the much-discussed 3
deaths of four persons, presumably caused by the then diminishing fever 3
epidemic. They said the place had a febrile smell. 3
3
Dutee himself thought little of the house, for he grew up to be a privateersman, 3
and served with distinction on the Vigilant under Capt. Cahoone in the War of 3
1812. He returned unharmed, married in 1814, and became a father on that 3
memorable night of September 23, 1815, when a great gale drove the waters of 3
the bay over half the town, and floated a tall sloop well up Westminster Street so 3
that its masts almost tapped the Harris windows in symbolic affirmation that the 3
new boy. Welcome, was a seaman's son. 3
3
Welcome did not survive his father, but lived to perish gloriously at 3
Fredericksburg in 1862. Neither he nor his son Archer knew of the shunned 3
house as other than a nuisance almost impossible to rent - perhaps on account of 3
the mustiness and sickly odour of unkempt old age. Indeed, it never was rented 3
after a series of deaths culminating in 1861, which the excitement of the war 3
tended to throw into obscurity. Carrington Harris, last of the male line, knew it 3
only as a deserted and somewhat picturesque center of legend until I told him 3
my experience. He had meant to tear it down and build an apartment house on 3
the site, but after my account, decided to let it stand, install plumbing, and rent 3
it. Nor has he yet had any difficulty in obtaining tenants. The horror has gone. 3
3
Ill 3
3
It may well be imagined how powerfully I was affected by the annals of the 3
Harrises. In this continuous record there seemed to me to brood a persistent evil 3
beyond anything in nature as I had known it; an evil clearly connected with the 3
house and not with the family. This impression was confirmed by my uncle's less 3
systematic array of miscellaneous data - legends transcribed from servant gossip, 3
cuttings from the papers, copies of death certificates by fellow- physicians, and 3
the like. All of this material I cannot hope to give, for my uncle was a tireless 3
antiquarian and very deeply interested in the shunned house; but I may refer to 3
several dominant points which earn notice by their recurrence through many 3
reports from diverse sources. For example, the servant gossip was practically 3
unanimous in attributing to the fungous and malodorous cellar of the house a 3
vast supremacy in evil influence. There had been servants - Ann White especially 3
3
3
3
814 3
3
3
3
- who would not use the cellar kitchen, and at least three well-defined legends 3
bore upon the queer quasi-human or diabolic outlines assumed by tree-roots and 3
patches of mould in that region. These latter narratives interested me 3
profoundly, on account of what I had seen in my boyhood, but I felt that most of 3
the significance had in each case been largely obscured by additions from the 3
common stock of local ghost lore. 3
3
Ann White, with her Exeter superstition, had promulgated the most extravagant 3
and at the same time most consistent tale; alleging that there must lie buried 3
beneath the house one of those vampires - the dead who retain their bodily form 3
and live on the blood or breath of the living - whose hideous legions send their 3
preying shapes or spirits abroad by night. To destroy a vampire one must, the 3
grandmothers say, exhume it and burn its heart, or at least drive a stake through 3
that organ; and Ann's dogged insistence on a search under the cellar had been 3
prominent in bringing about her discharge. 3
3
Her tales, however, commanded a wide audience, and were the more readily 3
accepted because the house indeed stood on land once used for burial purposes. 3
To me their interest depended less on this circumstance than on the peculiarly 3
appropriate way in which they dove-tailed with certain other things - the 3
complaint of the de parting servant Preserved Smith, who had preceded Ann 3
and never heard of her, that something "sucked his breath" at night; the death- 3
certificates of fever victims of 1804, issued by Dr. Chad Hopkins, and showing 3
the four deceased persons all unaccountably lacking in blood; and the obscure 3
passages of poor Rhoby Harris's ravings, where she complained of the sharp 3
teeth of a glassy-eyed, half-visible presence. 3
3
Free from unwarranted superstition though I am, these things produced in me an 3
odd sensation, which was intensified by a pair of widely separated newspaper 3
cuttings relating to deaths in the shunned house - one from the Providence 3
Gazette and Country-Journal of April 12, 1815, and the other from the Daily 3
Transcript and Chronicle of October 27, 1845 - each of which detailed an 3
appallingly grisly circumstance whose duplication was remarkable. It seems that 3
in both instances the dying person, in 1815 a gentle old lady named Stafford and 3
in 1845 a school-teacher of middle age named Eleazar Durfee, became 3
transfigured in a horrible way; glaring glassily and attempting to bite the throat 3
of the attending physician. Even more puzzling, though, was the final case which 3
put an end to the renting of the house - a series of anaemia deaths preceded by 3
progressive madnesses wherein the patient would craftily attempt the lives of his 3
relatives by incisions in the neck or wrists. 3
3
This was in 1860 and 1861, when my uncle had just begun his medical practice; 3
and before leaving for the front he heard much of it from his elder professional 3
3
3
3
815 3
3
3
3
colleagues. The really inexplicable thing was the way in which the victims - 3
ignorant people, for the ill- smelling and widely shunned house could now be 3
rented to no others - would babble maledictions in French, a language they could 3
not possibly have studied to any extent. It made one think of poor Rhoby Harris 3
nearly a century before, and so moved my uncle that he commenced collecting 3
historical data on the house after listening, some time subsequent to his return 3
from the war, to the first-hand account of Drs. Chase and Whitmarsh. Indeed, I 3
could see that my uncle had thought deeply on the subject, and that he was glad 3
of my own interest - an open-minded and sympathetic interest which enabled 3
him to discuss with me matters at which others would merely have laughed. His 3
fancy had not gone so far as mine, but he felt that the place was rare in its 3
imaginative potentialities, and worthy of note as an inspiration in the field of the 3
grotesque and macabre. 3
3
For my part, I was disposed to take the whole subject with pro found 3
seriousness, and began at once not only to review the evidence, but to 3
accumulate as much as I could. I talked with the elderly Archer Harris, then 3
owner of the house, many times before his death in 1916; and obtained from him 3
and his still surviving maiden sister Alice an authentic corroboration of all the 3
family data my uncle had collected. When, however, I asked them what 3
connection with France or its language the house could have, they confessed 3
themselves as frankly baffled and ignorant as I. Archer knew nothing, and all 3
that Miss Harris could say was that an old allusion her grandfather, Dutee 3
Harris, had heard of might have shed a little light. The old seaman, who had 3
survived his son Welcome's death in battle by two years, had not himself known 3
the legend; but recalled that his earliest nurse, the ancient Maria Robbins, 3
seemed darkly aware of something that might have lent a weird significance to 3
the French ravings of Rhoby Harris, which she had so often heard during the last 3
days of that hapless woman. Maria had been at the shunned house from 1769 till 3
the removal of the family in 1783, and had seen Mercy Dexter die. Once she 3
hinted to the child Dutee of a somewhat peculiar circumstance in Mercy's last 3
moments, but he had soon for gotten all about it save that it was something 3
peculiar. The grand daughter, moreover, recalled even this much with difficulty. 3
She and her brother were not so much interested in the house as was Archer's 3
son Carrington, the present owner, with whom I talked after my experience. 3
3
Having exhausted the Harris family of all the information it could furnish, I 3
turned my attention to early town records and deeds with a zeal more 3
penetrating than that which my uncle had occasionally shown in the same work. 3
What I wished was a comprehensive history of the site from its very settlement 3
in 1636 - or even before, if any Narragansett Indian legend could be unearthed to 3
supply the data. I found, at the start, that the land had been part of a long strip of 3
the lot granted originally to John Throckmorton; one of many similar strips 3
3
3
3
816 3
3
3
3
beginning at the Town Street beside the river and extending up over the hill to a 3
line roughly corresponding with the modern Hope Street. The Throckmorton lot 3
had later, of course, been much subdivided; and I became very assiduous in 3
tracing that section through which Back or Benefit Street was later run. It had, a 3
rumour indeed said, been the Throckmorton graveyard; but as I examined the 3
records more carefully, I found that the graves had all been transferred at an 3
early date to the North Burial Ground on the Pawtucket West Road. 3
3
Then suddenly I came - by a rare piece of chance, since it was not in the main 3
body of records and might easily have been missed - upon something which 3
aroused my keenest eagerness, fitting in as it did with several of the queerest 3
phases of the affair. It was the record of a lease in 1697, of a small tract of ground 3
to an Etienne Roulet and wife. At last the French element had appeared - that, 3
and another deeper element of horror which the name conjured up from the 3
darkest recesses of my weird and heterogeneous reading - and I feverishly 3
studied the platting of the locality as it had been before the cutting through and 3
partial straightening of Back Street between 1747 and 1758. I found what I had 3
half expected, that where the shunned house now stood, the Roulets had laid out 3
their graveyard behind a one-story and attic cottage, and that no record of any 3
transfer of. graves existed. The document, indeed, ended in much confusion; and 3
I was forced to ransack both the Rhode Island Historical Society and Shepley 3
Library before I could find a local door which the name of Etienne Roulet would 3
unlock. In the end I did find something; some thing of such vague but monstrous 3
import that I set about at once to examine the cellar of the shunned house itself 3
with a new and ex cited minuteness. 3
3
The Roulets, it seemed, had come in 1696 from East Greenwich, down the west 3
shore of Narragansett Bay. They were Huguenots from Caude, and had 3
encountered much opposition before the Providence selectmen allowed them to 3
settle in the town. Unpopularity had dogged them in East Greenwich, whither 3
they had come in 1686, after the revocation of the Edict of Nantes, and rumour 3
said that the cause of dislike extended beyond mere racial and national prejudice, 3
or the land disputes which involved other French settlers with the English in 3
rivalries which not even Governor Andros could quell. But their ardent 3
Protestantism - too ardent, some whispered - and their evident distress when 3
virtually driven from the village had been granted a haven; and the swarthy 3
Etienne Roulet, less apt at agriculture than at reading queer books and drawing 3
queer diagrams, was given a clerical post in the warehouse at Pardon 3
Tillinghast's wharf, far south in Town Street. There had, however, been a riot of 3
3
some sort later on - perhaps forty years later, after old Roulet's death - and no 3
one seemed to hear of the family after that. 3
3
3
3
817 3
3
3
3
For a century and more, it appeared, the Roulets had been well re membered and 3
frequently discussed as vivid incidents in the quiet life of a New England 3
seaport. Etienne's son Paul, a surly fellow whose erratic conduct had probably 3
provoked the riot which wiped out the family, was particularly a source of 3
speculation; and though Providence never shared the witchcraft panics of her 3
Puritan neighbours, it was freely intimated by old wives that his prayers were 3
neither uttered at the proper time nor directed toward the proper object. All this 3
had undoubtedly formed the basis of the legend known by old Maria Robbins. 3
What relation it had to the French ravings of Rhoby Harris and other inhabitants 3
of the shunned house, imagination or future discovery alone could determine. I 3
wondered how many of those who had known the legends realized that 3
additional link with the terrible which my wider reading had given me; that 3
ominous item in the annals of morbid horror which tells of the creature Jacques 3
Roulet, of Caude, who in 1598 was condemned to death as a daemoniac but 3
afterward saved from the stake by the Paris parliament and shut in a madhouse. 3
He had been found covered with blood and shreds of flesh in a wood, shortly 3
after the killing and rending of a boy by a pair of wolves. One wolf was seen to 3
lope away unhurt. Surely a pretty hearthside tale, with a queer significance as to 3
name and place; but I decided that the Providence gossips could not have 3
generally known of it. Had they known, the coincidence of names would have 3
brought some drastic and frightened action- indeed, might not its limited 3
whispering have precipitated the final riot which erased the Roulets from the 3
town? 3
3
I now visited the accursed place with increased frequency; studying the 3
unwholesome vegetation of the garden, examining all the walls of the building, 3
and poring over every inch of the earthen cellar floor. Finally, with Carrington 3
Harris's permission, I fitted a key to the disused door opening from the cellar 3
directly upon Benefit Street, preferring to have a more immediate access to the 3
outside world than the dark stairs, ground floor hall, and front door could give. 3
There, where morbidity lurked most thickly, I searched and poked during long 3
afternoons when the sunlight filtered in through the cobwebbed above-ground 3
door which placed me only a few feet from the placid sidewalk outside. Nothing 3
new rewarded my efforts-only the same depressing mustiness and faint 3
suggestions of noxious odours and nitrous outlines on the floor - and I fancy that 3
many pedestrians must have watched me curiously through the broken panes. 3
3
At length, upon a suggestion of my uncle's, I decided to try the spot nocturnally; 3
and one stormy midnight ran the beams of an electric torch over the mouldy 3
floor with its uncanny shapes and distorted, half-phosphorescent fungi. The 3
place had dispirited me curiously that evening, and I was almost prepared when 3
I saw - or thought I saw - amidst the whitish deposits a particularly sharp 3
definition of the "huddled form" I had suspected from boyhood. Its clear ness 3
3
3
3
818 3
3
3
3
was astonishing and unprecedented - and as I watched I seemed to see again the 3
thin, yellowish, shimmering exhalation which had startled me on that rainy 3
afternoon so many years before. 3
3
Above the anthropomorphic patch of mould by the fireplace it rose; a subtle, 3
sickish, almost luminous vapour which, as it hung trembling in the dampness, 3
seemed to develop vague and shocking suggestions of form, gradually trailing 3
off into nebulous decay and passing up into the blackness of the great chimney 3
with a foetor in its wake. It was truly horrible, and the more so to me because of. 3
what I knew of the spot. Refusing to flee, I watched it fade - and as I watched I 3
felt that it was in turn watching me greedily with eyes more imaginable than 3
visible. When I told my uncle about it he was greatly aroused; and after a tense 3
hour of reflection, arrived at a definite and drastic decision. Weighing in his 3
mind the importance of the matter, and the significance of our relation to it, he 3
insisted that we both test - and if possible destroy - the horror of the house by a 3
joint night or nights of aggressive vigil in that musty and fungous-cursed cellar. 3
3
IV 3
3
On Wednesday, June 25, 1919, after a proper notification of Carring ton Harris 3
which did not include surmises as to what we expected to find, my uncle and I 3
conveyed to the shunned house two camp chairs and a folding camp cot, 3
together with some scientific mechanism of greater weight and intricacy. These 3
we placed in the cellar during the day, screening the windows with paper and 3
planning to return in the evening for our first vigil. We had locked the door from 3
the cellar to the ground floor; and having a key to the outside cellar door, we 3
were prepared to leave our expensive and delicate apparatus - which we had 3
obtained secretly and at great cost - as many days as our vigil might need to be 3
protracted. It was our design to sit up together till very late, and then watch 3
singly till dawn in two- hour stretches, myself first and then my companion; the 3
inactive member resting on the cot. 3
3
The natural leadership with which my uncle procured the instruments from the 3
laboratories of Brown University and the Cranston Street Armory, and 3
instinctively assumed direction of our venture, was a marvellous commentary on 3
the potential vitality and resilience of a man of eighty-one. Elihu Whipple had 3
lived according to the hygienic laws he had preached as a physician, and but for 3
what happened later would be here in full vigour today. Only two persons 3
suspect what did happen - Carrington Harris and myself. I had to tell Harris 3
because he owned the house and deserved to know what had gone out of it. 3
Then, too, we had spoken to him in advance of our quest; and I felt after my 3
uncle's going that he would understand and assist me in some vitally necessary 3
3
3
3
819 3
3
3
3
public explanations. He turned very pale, but agreed to help me, and decided 3
that it would now be safe to rent the house. 3
3
To declare that we were not nervous on that rainy night of watching would be an 3
exaggeration both gross and ridiculous. We were not, as I have said, in any sense 3
childishly superstitious, but scientific study and reflection had taught us that the 3
known universe of three dimensions embraces the merest fraction of the whole 3
cosmos of substance and energy. In this case an overwhelming preponderance of 3
evidence from numerous authentic sources pointed to the tenacious existence of 3
certain forces of great power and, so far as the human point of view is concerned, 3
exceptional malignancy. To say that we actually believed in vampires or 3
werewolves would be a carelessly inclusive statement. Rather must it be said that 3
we were not prepared to deny the possibility of certain unfamiliar and 3
unclassified modifications of vital force and attenuated matter; existing very 3
infrequently in three-dimensional space because of its more intimate connection 3
with other spatial units, yet close enough to the boundary of our own to furnish 3
us occasional manifestations which we, for lack of a proper vantage-point, may 3
never hope to understand. 3
3
In short, it seemed to my uncle and me that an incontrovertible array of facts 3
pointed to some lingering influence in the shunned house; traceable to one or 3
another of the ill-favoured French settlers of two centuries before, and still 3
operative through rare and un known laws of atomic and electronic motion. That 3
the family of Roulet had possessed an abnormal affinity for outer circles of entity 3
- dark spheres which for normal folk hold only repulsion and terror - their 3
recorded history seemed to prove. Had not, then, the riots of those bygone 3
seventeen-thirties set moving certain kinetic patterns in the morbid brain of one 3
or more of them - notably the sinister Paul Roulet - which obscurely survived the 3
bodies murdered, and continued to function in some multiple-dimensioned 3
space along the original lines of force determined by a frantic hatred of the 3
encroaching community? 3
3
Such a thing was surely not a physical or biochemical impossibility in the light of 3
a newer science which includes the theories of relativity and intra-atomic action. 3
One might easily imagine an alien nucleus of substance or energy, formless or 3
otherwise, kept alive by imperceptible or immaterial subtractions from the life- 3
force or bodily tissue and fluids of other and more palpably living things into 3
which it penetrates and with whose fabric it sometimes completely merges itself. 3
It might be actively hostile, or it might be dictated merely by blind motives of 3
self-preservation. In any case such a monster must of necessity be in our scheme 3
of things an anomaly and an intruder, whose extirpation forms a primary duty 3
with every man not an enemy to the world's life, health, and sanity. 3
3
3
3
820 3
3
3
3
What baffled us was our utter ignorance of the aspect in which we might 3
encounter the thing. No sane person had even seen it, and few had ever feh it 3
definitely. It might be pure energy - a form ethereal and outside the realm of 3
substance-or it might be partly material; some unknown and equivocal mass of 3
plasticity, capable of changing at will to nebulous approximations of the solid, 3
liquid, gaseous, or tenuously unparticled states. The anthropomorphic patch of 3
mould on the floor, the form of the yellowish vapour, and the curvature of the 3
tree-roots in some of the old tales, all argued at least a remote and reminiscent 3
connection with the human shape; but how representative or permanent that 3
similarity might be, none could say with any kind of certainty. 3
3
We had devised two weapons to fight it; a large and specially fitted Crookes tube 3
operated by powerful storage batteries and pro vided with peculiar screens and 3
reflectors, in case it proved intangible and opposable only by vigorously 3
destructive ether radiations, and a pair of military flame-throwers of the sort 3
used in the World War, in case it proved partly material and susceptible of 3
mechanical destruction - for like the superstitious Exeter rustics, we were 3
prepared to burn the thing's heart out if heart existed to burn. All this aggressive 3
mechanism we set in the cellar in positions care fully arranged with reference to 3
the cot and chairs, and to the spot before the fireplace where the mould had 3
taken strange shapes. That suggestive patch, by the way, was only faintly visible 3
when we placed our furniture and instruments, and when we returned that 3
evening for the actual vigil. For a moment I half-doubted that I had ever seen it 3
in the more definitely limned form - but then I thought of the legends. 3
3
Our cellar vigil began at 10 P.M., daylight saving time, and as it continued we 3
found no promise of pertinent developments. A weak, filtered glow from the 3
rain-harassed street lamps outside, and a feeble phosphorescence from the 3
detestable fungi within, showed the drip ping stone of the walls, from which all 3
traces of whitewash had vanished; the dank, foetid and mildew-tainted hard 3
earth floor with its obscene fungi; the rotting remains of what had been stools, 3
chairs and tables, and other more shapeless furniture; the heavy planks and 3
massive beams of the ground floor overhead; the decrepit plank door leading to 3
bins and chambers beneath other parts of the house; the crumbling stone 3
staircase with ruined wooden hand-rail; and the crude and cavernous fireplace of 3
blackened brick where rusted iron fragments revealed the past presence of 3
hooks, andirons, spit, crane, and a door to the Dutch oven - these things, and our 3
austere cot and camp chairs, and the heavy and intricate destructive machinery 3
we had brought. 3
3
We had, as in my own former explorations, left the door to the street unlocked; 3
so that a direct and practical path of escape might lie open in case of 3
manifestations beyond our power to deal with. It was our idea that our 3
3
3
3
821 3
3
3
3
continued nocturnal presence would call forth whatever malign entity lurked 3
there; and that being prepared, we could dispose of the thing with one or the 3
other of our provided means as soon as we had recognised and observed it 3
sufficiently. How long it might require to evoke and extinguish the thing, we had 3
no notion. It occurred to us, too, that our venture was far from safe, for in what 3
strength the thing might appear no one could tell. But we deemed the game 3
worth the hazard, and embarked on it alone and unhesitatingly; conscious that 3
the seeking of outside aid would only expose us to ridicule and perhaps defeat 3
our entire purpose. Such was our frame of mind as we talked - far into the night, 3
till my uncle's growing drowsiness made me remind him to lie down for his two- 3
hour sleep. 3
3
Something like fear chilled me as I sat there in the small hours alone - 1 say alone, 3
for one who sits by a sleeper is indeed alone; perhaps more alone than he can 3
realise. My uncle breathed heavily, his deep inhalations and exhalations 3
accompanied by the rain outside, and punctuated by another nerve-racking 3
sound of distant dripping water within - for the house was repulsively damp 3
even in dry weather, and in this storm positively swamp-like. I studied the loose, 3
antique-masonry of the walls in the fungous-light and the feeble rays which stole 3
in from the street through the screened windows; and once, when the noisome 3
atmosphere of the place seemed about to sicken me, I opened the door and 3
looked up and down the street, feasting my eyes on familiar sights and my 3
nostrils on whole some air. Still nothing occurred to reward my watching; and I 3
yawned repeatedly, fatigue getting the better of apprehension. 3
3
Then the stirring of my uncle in his sleep attracted my notice. He had turned 3
restlessly on the cot several times during the latter half of the first hour, but now 3
he was breathing with unusual irregularity, occasionally heaving a sigh which 3
held more than a few of the qualities of a choking moan. I turned my electric 3
flashlight on him and found his face averted, so rising and crossing to the other 3
side of the cot, I again flashed the light to see if he seemed in any pain. What I 3
saw unnerved me most surprisingly, considering its relative triviality. It must 3
have been merely the association of an odd circumstance with the sinister nature 3
of our location and mission, for surely the circumstance was not in itself frightful 3
or unnatural. It was merely that my uncle's facial expression, disturbed no doubt 3
by the strange dreams which our situation prompted, betrayed consider able 3
agitation, and seemed not at all characteristic of him. His habitual expression was 3
one of kindly and well-bred calm, whereas now a variety of emotions seemed 3
struggling within him. I think, on the whole, that it was this variety which chiefly 3
disturbed me. My uncle, as he gasped and tossed in increasing perturbation and 3
with eyes that had now started open, seemed not one man but many men, and 3
suggested a curious quality of alienage from himself. 3
3
3
3
822 3
3
3
3
All at once he commenced to mutter, and I did not like the look of his mouth and 3
teeth as he spoke. The words were at first indistinguishable, and then - with a 3
tremendous start - I recognised some thing about them which filled me with icy 3
fear till I recalled the breadth of my uncle's education and the interminable 3
translations he had made from anthropological and antiquarian articles in the 3
Revue des Deux Mondes. For the venerable Elihu Whipple was muttering in 3
French, and the few phrases I could distinguish seemed connected with the 3
darkest myths he had ever adapted from the famous Paris magazine. 3
3
Suddenly a perspiration broke out on the sleeper's forehead, and he leaped 3
abruptly up, half awake. The jumble of French changed to a cry in English, and 3
the hoarse voice shouted excitedly, "My breath, my breath!" Then the awakening 3
became complete, and with a subsidence of facial expression to the normal state 3
my uncle seized my hand and began to relate a dream whose nucleus of 3
significance I could only surmise with a kind of awe. 3
3
He had, he said, floated off from a very ordinary series of dream- pictures into a 3
scene whose strangeness was related to nothing he had ever read. It was of this 3
world, and yet not of it - a shadowy geometrical confusion in which could be 3
seen elements of familiar things in most unfamiliar and perturbing combinations. 3
There was a suggestion of queerly disordered pictures superimposed one upon 3
an other; an arrangement in which the essentials of time as well as of space 3
seemed dissolved and mixed in the most illogical fashion. In this kaleidoscopic 3
vortex of phantasmal images were occasional snap-shots, if one might use the 3
term, of singular clearness but un accountable heterogeneity. 3
3
Once my uncle thought he lay in a carelessly dug open pit, with a crowd of angry 3
faces framed by straggling locks and three-cornered hats frowning down at him. 3
Again he seemed to be in the interior of a house - an old house, apparently - but 3
the details and inhabitants were constantly changing, and he could never be 3
certain of the faces or the furniture, or even of the room itself, since doors and 3
windows seemed in just as great a state of flux as the more presumably mobile 3
objects. It was queer - damnably queer - and my uncle spoke almost sheepishly, 3
as if half expecting not to be believed, when he declared that of the strange faces 3
many had unmistakably borne the features of the Harris family. And all the 3
while there was a personal sensation of choking, as if some pervasive presence 3
had spread itself through his body and sought to possess itself of his vital 3
processes. I shuddered at the thought of those vital processes, worn as they were 3
by eighty-one years of continuous functioning, in conflict with unknown forces 3
of which the youngest and strongest system might well be afraid; but in another 3
moment reflected that dreams are only dreams, and that these uncomfortable 3
visions could be, at most, no more than my uncle's reaction to the investigations 3
and expectations which had lately filled our minds to the exclusion of all else. 3
3
3
3
823 3
3
3
3
Conversation, also, soon tended to dispel my sense of strangeness; and in time I 3
yielded to my yawns and took my turn at slumber. My uncle seemed now very 3
wakeful, and welcomed his period of watching even though the nightmare had 3
aroused him far ahead of his al lotted two hours. Sleep seized me quickly, and I 3
was at once haunted with dreams of the most disturbing kind. I felt, in my 3
visions, a cosmic and abysmal loneness; with hostility surging from all sides 3
upon some prison where I lay confined. I seemed bound and gagged, and 3
taunted by the echoing yells of distant multitudes who thirsted for my blood. My 3
uncle's face came to me with less pleasant associations than in waking hours, and 3
I recall many futile struggles and at tempts to scream. It was not a pleasant sleep, 3
and for a second I was not sorry for the echoing shriek which clove through the 3
barriers of dream and flung me to a sharp and startled awakeness in which every 3
actual object before my eyes stood out with more than natural clearness and 3
reality. 3
3
V 3
3
I had been lying with my face away from my uncle's chair, so that in this sudden 3
flash of awakening I saw only the door to the street, the more northerly window, 3
and the wall and floor and ceiling toward the north of the room, all 3
photographed with morbid vivid ness on my brain in a light brighter than the 3
glow of the fungi or the rays from the street outside. It was not a strong or even a 3
fairly strong light; certainly not nearly strong enough to read an average book 3
by. But it cast a shadow of myself and the cot on the floor, and had a yellowish, 3
penetrating force that hinted at things more portent than luminosity. This I 3
perceived with unhealthy sharpness despite the fact that two of my other senses 3
were violently assailed. For on my ears rang the reverberations of that shocking 3
scream, while my nostrils revolted at the stench which filled the place. My mind, 3
as alert as my senses, recognised the gravely unusual; and almost automatically I 3
leaped up and turned about to grasp the destructive instruments which we had 3
left trained on the mouldy spot before the fireplace. As I turned, I dreaded what I 3
was to see; for the scream had been in my uncle's voice, and I knew not against 3
what menace I should have to defend him and myself. 3
3
Yet after all, the sight was worse than I had dreaded. There are horrors beyond 3
horrors, and this was one of those nuclei of all dreamable hideousness which the 3
cosmos saves to blast an accursed and unhappy few. Out of the fungous-ridden 3
earth steamed up a va porous corpse-light, yellow and diseased, which bubbled 3
and lapped to a gigantic height in vague outlines half human and half 3
monstrous, through which I could see the chimney and fireplace beyond. It was 3
all eyes - wolfish and mocking - and the rugose insect-like head dissolved at the 3
top to a thin stream of mist which curled putridly about and finally vanished up 3
the chimney. I say that I saw this thing, but it is only in conscious retrospection 3
3
3
3
824 3
3
3
3
that I ever definitely traced its damnable approach to form. At the time it was to 3
me only a seething dimly phosphorescent cloud of fungous loathsomeness, 3
enveloping and dissolving to an abhorrent plasticity the one object to which all 3
my attention was focused. That object was my uncle - the venerable Elihu 3
Whipple - who with blackening and 3
3
decaying features leered and gibbered at me, and reached out drip ping claws to 3
rend me in the fury which this horror had brought. 3
3
It was a sense of routine which kept me from going mad. I had drilled myself in 3
preparation for the crucial moment, and blind training saved me. Recognising 3
the bubbling evil as no substance reach able by matter or material chemistry, and 3
therefore ignoring the flame-thrower which loomed on my left, I threw on the 3
current of the Crookes tube apparatus, and focussed toward that scene of 3
immortal blasphemousness the strongest ether radiations which men's art can 3
arouse from the spaces and fluids of nature. There was a bluish haze and a 3
frenzied sputtering, and the yellowish phosphorescence grew dimmer to my 3
eyes. But I saw the dimness was only that of contrast, and that the waves from 3
the machine had no effect whatever. 3
3
Then, in the midst of that daemoniac spectacle, I saw a fresh horror which 3
brought cries to my lips and sent me fumbling and staggering towards that 3
unlocked door to the quiet street, careless of what abnormal terrors I loosed upon 3
the world, or what thoughts or judgments of men I brought down upon my 3
head. In that dim blend of blue and yellow the form of my uncle had commenced 3
a nauseous liquefaction whose essence eludes all description, and in which there 3
played across his vanishing face such changes of identity as only madness can 3
conceive. He was at once a devil and a multitude, a charnel-house and a pageant. 3
Lit by the mixed and uncertain beams, that gelatinous face assumed a dozen - a 3
score - a hundred- aspects; grinning, as it sank to the ground on a body that 3
melted like tallow, in the caricatured likeness of legions strange and yet not 3
strange. 3
3
I saw the features of the Harris line, masculine and feminine, adult and infantile, 3
and other features old and young, coarse and re fined, familiar and unfamiliar. 3
For a second there flashed a degraded counterfeit of a miniature of poor Rhoby 3
Harris that I had seen in the School of Design Museum, and another time I 3
thought I caught the rawboned image of Mercy Dexter as I recalled her from a 3
painting in Carrington Harris's house. It was frightful beyond conception; 3
toward the last, when a curious blend of servant and baby visages flickered close 3
to the fungous floor where a pool of greenish grease was spreading, it seemed as 3
though the shifting features fought against themselves, and strove to form 3
contours like those of my uncle's kindly face. I like to think that he existed at that 3
3
3
3
825 3
3
3
3
moment, and that he tried to bid me farewell. It seems to me I hiccoughed a 3
farewell from my own parched throat as I lurched out into the street; a thin 3
stream of grease following me through the door to the rain- drenched sidewalk. 3
3
The rest is shadowy and monstrous. There was no one in the soaking street, and 3
in all the world there was no one I dared tell. I walked aimlessly south past 3
College Hill and the Athenaeum, down Hopkins Street, and over the bridge to 3
the business section where tall buildings seemed to guard me as modern material 3
things guard the world from ancient and unwholesome wonder. Then the grey 3
dawn unfolded wetly from the east, silhouetting the archaic hill and its venerable 3
steeples, and beckoning me to the place where my terrible work was still 3
unfinished. And in the end I went, wet, hatless, and dazed in the morning light, 3
and entered that awful door in Benefit Street which I had left ajar, and which still 3
swung cryptically in full sight of the early householders to whom I dared not 3
speak. 3
3
The grease was gone, for the mouldy floor was porous. And in front of the 3
fireplace was no vestige of the giant doubled-up form in nitre. I looked at the cot, 3
the chairs, the instruments, my neglected hat, and the yellowed straw hat of my 3
uncle. Dazedness was upper most, and I could scarcely recall what was dream 3
and what was reality. Then thought trickled back, and I knew that I had 3
witnessed things more horrible than I had dreamed. Sitting down, I tried to 3
conjecture as nearly as sanity would let me just what had happened, and how I 3
might end the horror, if indeed it had been real. Matter it seemed not to be, nor 3
ether, nor anything else conceivable by mortal mind. What, then, but some exotic 3
emanation; some vampirish vapour such as Exeter rustics tell of as lurking over 3
certain church yards? This I felt was the clue, and again I looked at the floor 3
before the fireplace where the mould and nitre had taken strange forms. In ten 3
minutes my mind was made up, and taking my hat I set out for home, where I 3
bathed, ate, and gave by telephone an order for a pick- axe, a spade, a military 3
gas-mask, and six carboys of sulphuric acid, all to be delivered the next morning 3
at the cellar door of the shunned house in Benefit Street. After that I tried to 3
sleep; and failing, passed the hours in reading and in the composition of inane 3
verses to counteract my mood. 3
3
At 11 A.M. the next day I commenced digging. It was sunny weather, and I was 3
glad of that. I was still alone, for as much as I feared the unknown horror I 3
sought, there was more fear in the thought of telling anybody. Later I told Harris 3
only through sheer necessity, and because he had heard odd tales from old 3
people which disposed him ever so little toward belief. As I turned up the 3
stinking black earth in front of the fireplace, my spade causing a viscous yellow 3
ichor to ooze from the white fungi which it severed, I trembled at the dubious 3
3
3
3
826 3
3
3
3
thoughts of what I might uncover. Some secrets of inner earth are not good for 3
mankind, and this seemed to me one of them. 3
3
My hand shook perceptibly, but still I delved; after a while standing in the large 3
hole I had made. With the deepening of the hole, which was about six feet 3
square, the evil smell increased; and I lost all doubt of my imminent contact with 3
the hellish thing whose emanations had cursed the house for over a century and 3
a half. I wondered what it would look like - what its form and substance would 3
be, and how big it might have waxed through long ages of life- sucking. At 3
length I climbed out of the hole and dispersed the heaped-up dirt, then arranging 3
the great carboys of acid around and near two sides, so that when necessary I 3
might empty them all down the aperture in quick succession. After that I 3
dumped earth only along the other two sides; working more slowly and donning 3
my gas- mask as the smell grew. I was nearly unnerved at my proximity to a 3
nameless thing at the bottom of a pit. 3
3
Suddenly my spade struck something softer than earth. I shuddered and made a 3
motion as if to climb out of the hole, which was now as deep as my neck. Then 3
courage returned, and I scraped away more dirt in the light of the electric torch I 3
had provided. The surface I uncovered was fishy and glassy - a kind of semi- 3
putrid congealed jelly with suggestions of translucency. I scraped further, and 3
saw that it had form. There was a rift where a part of the substance was folded 3
over. The exposed area was huge and roughly cylindrical; like a mammoth soft 3
blue-white stovepipe doubled in two, its largest part some two feet in diameter. 3
Still more I scraped, and then abruptly I leaped out of the hole and away from 3
the filthy thing; frantically unstopping and tilting the heavy carboys, and 3
precipitating their corrosive contents one after another down that charnel gulf 3
and upon this unthinkable abnormality whose titan elbow I had seen. 3
3
The blinding maelstrom of greenish-yellow vapour which surged tempestuously 3
up from that hole as the floods of acid descended, will never leave my memory. 3
All along the hill people tell of the yellow day, when virulent and horrible fumes 3
arose from the factory waste dumped in the Providence River, but I know how 3
mistaken they are as to the source. They tell, too, of the hideous roar which at the 3
same time came from some disordered water-pipe or gas main underground - 3
but again I could correct them if I dared. It was unspeakably shocking, and I do 3
not see how I lived through it. I did faint after emptying the fourth carboy, which 3
I had to handle after the fumes had begun to penetrate my mask; but when I 3
recovered I saw that the hole was emitting no fresh vapours. 3
3
The two remaining carboys I emptied down without particular result, and after a 3
time I felt it safe to shovel the earth back into the pit. It was twilight before I was 3
done, but fear had gone out of the place. The dampness was less foetid, and all 3
3
3
3
827 3
3
3
3
the strange fungi had withered to a kind of harmless greyish powder which blew 3
ashlike along the floor. One of earth's nethermost terrors had perished forever; 3
and if there be a hell, it had received at last the daemon soul of an unhallowed 3
thing. And as I patted down the last spadeful of mould, I shed the first of many 3
tears with which I have paid unaffected tribute to my beloved uncle's memory. 3
3
The next spring no more pale grass and strange weeds came up in the shunned 3
house's terraced garden, and shortly afterward Carring ton Harris rented the 3
place. It it still spectral, but its strangeness fascinates me, and I shall find mixed 3
with my relief a queer regret when it is torn down to make way for a tawdry 3
shop or vulgar apartment building. The barren old trees in the yard have begun 3
to bear small, sweet apples, and last year the birds nested in their gnarled 3
boughs. 3

When Randolph Carter was thirty he lost the key of the gate of dreams. Prior to 3
that time he had made up for the prosiness of life by nightly excursions to 3
strange and ancient cities beyond space, and lovely, unbelievable garden lands 3
across ethereal seas; but as middle age hardened upon him he felt those liberties 3
slipping away little by little, until at last he was cut off altogether. No more could 3
his galleys sail up the river Oukranos past the gilded spires of Thran, or his 3
elephant caravans tramp through perfumed jungles in Kled, where forgotten 3
palaces with veined ivory columns sleep lovely and unbroken under the moon. 3
3
He had read much of things as they are, and talked with too many people. Well- 3
meaning philosophers had taught him to look into the logical relations of things, 3
and analyse the processes which shaped his thoughts and fancies. Wonder had 3
gone away, and he had forgotten that all life is only a set of pictures in the brain, 3
among which there is no difference betwixt those born of real things and those 3
born of inward dreamings, and no cause to value the one above the other. 3
Custom had dinned into his ears a superstitious reverence for that which 3
tangibly and physically exists, and had made him secretly ashamed to dwell in 3
visions. Wise men told him his simple fancies were inane and childish, and even 3
more absurd because their actors persist in fancying them full of meaning and 3
purpose as the blind cosmos grinds aimlessly on from nothing to something and 3
from something back to nothing again, neither heeding nor knowing the wishes 3
or existence of the minds that flicker for a second now and then in the darkness. 3
3
They had chained him down to things that are, and had then explained the 3
workings of those things till mystery had gone out of the world. When he 3
complained, and longed to escape into twilight realms where magic moulded all 3
the little vivid fragments and prized associations of his mind into vistas of 3
breathless expectancy and unquenchable delight, they turned him instead 3
toward the new-found prodigies of science, bidding him find wonder in the 3
atom's vortex and mystery in the sky's dimensions. And when he had failed to 3
find these boons in things whose laws are known and measurable, they told him 3
he lacked imagination, and was immature because he preferred dream-illusions 3
to the illusions of our physical creation. 3
3
So Carter had tried to do as others did, and pretended that the common events 3
and emotions of earthy minds were more important than the fantasies of rare 3
3
3
3

3
3
3
and delicate souls. He did not dissent when they told him that the animal pain of 3
a stuck pig or dyspeptic ploughman in real life is a greater thing than the 3
peerless beauty of Narath with its hundred carven gates and domes of 3
chalcedony, which he dimly remembered from his dreams; and under their 3
guidance he cultivated a painstaking sense of pity and tragedy. 3
3
Once in a while, though, he could not help seeing how shallow, fickle, and 3
meaningless all human aspirations are, and how emptily our real impulses 3
contrast with those pompous ideals we profess to hold. Then he would have 3
recourse to the polite laughter they had taught him to use against the 3
extravagance and artificiality of dreams; for he saw that the daily life of our 3
world is every inch as extravagant and artificial, and far less worthy of respect 3
because of its poverty in beauty and its silly reluctance to admit its own lack of 3
reason and purpose. In this way he became a kind of humorist, for he did not see 3
that even humour is empty in a mindless universe devoid of any true standard of 3
consistency or inconsistency. 3
3
In the first days of his bondage he had turned to the gentle churchly faith 3
endeared to him by the naive trust of his fathers, for thence stretched mystic 3
avenues which seemed to promise escape from life. Only on closer view did he 3
mark the starved fancy and beauty, the stale and prosy triteness, and the owlish 3
gravity and grotesque claims of solid truth which reigned boresomely and 3
overwhelmingly among most of its professors; or feel to the full the 3
awkwardness with which it sought to keep alive as literal fact the outgrown fears 3
and guesses of a primal race confronting the unknown. It wearied Carter to see 3
how solemnly people tried to make earthly reality out of old myths which every 3
step of their boasted science confuted, and this misplaced seriousness killed the 3
attachment he might have kept for the ancient creeds had they been content to 3
offer the sonorous rites and emotional outlets in their true guise of ethereal 3
fantasy. 3
3
But when he came to study those who had thrown off the old myths, he found 3
them even more ugly than those who had not. They did not know that beauty 3
lies in harmony, and that loveliness of life has no standard amidst an aimless 3
cosmos save only its harmony with the dreams and the feelings which have gone 3
before and blindly moulded our little spheres out of the rest of chaos. They did 3
not see that good and evil and beauty and ugliness are only ornamental fruits of 3
perspective, whose sole value lies in their linkage to what chance made our 3
fathers think and feel, and whose finer details are different for every race and 3
culture. Instead, they either denied these things altogether or transferred them to 3
the crude, vague instincts which they shared with the beasts and peasants; so 3
that their lives were dragged malodorously out in pain, ugliness, and 3
disproportion, yet filled with a ludicrous pride at having escaped from 3
3
3
3
830 3
3
3
3
something no more unsound than that which still held them. They had traded 3
the false gods of fear and blind piety for those of license and anarchy. 3
3
Carter did not taste deeply of these modern freedoms; for their cheapness and 3
squalor sickened a spirit loving beauty alone while his reason rebelled at the 3
flimsy logic with which their champions tried to gild brute impulse with a 3
sacredness stripped from the idols they had discarded. He saw that most of 3
them, in common with their cast-off priestcraft, could not escape from the 3
delusion that life has a meaning apart from that which men dream into it; and 3
could not lay aside the crude notion of ethics and obligations beyond those of 3
beauty, even when all Nature shrieked of its unconsciousness and impersonal 3
unmorality in the light of their scientific discoveries. Warped and bigoted with 3
preconceived illusions of justice, freedom, and consistency, they cast off the old 3
lore and the old way with the old beliefs; nor ever stopped to think that that lore 3
and those ways were the sole makers of their present thoughts and judgments, 3
and the sole guides and standards in a meaningless universe without fixed aims 3
or stable points of reference. Having lost these artificial settings, their lives grew 3
void of direction and dramatic interest; till at length they strove to drown their 3
ennui in bustle and pretended usefulness, noise and excitement, barbaric display 3
and animal sensation. When these things palled, disappointed, or grew nauseous 3
through revulsion, they cultivated irony and bitterness, and found fault with the 3
social order. Never could they realize that their brute foundations were as 3
shifting and contradictory as the gods of their elders, and that the satisfaction of 3
one moment is the bane of the next. Calm, lasting beauty comes only in a dream, 3
and this solace the world had thrown away when in its worship of the real it 3
threw away the secrets of childhood and innocence. 3
3
Amidst this chaos of hollowness and unrest Carter tried to live as befitted a man 3
of keen thought and good heritage. With his dreams fading under the ridicule of 3
the age he could not believe in anything, but the love of harmony kept him close 3
to the ways of his race and station. He walked impassive through the cities of 3
men, and sighed because no vista seemed fully real; because every flash of 3
yellow sunlight on tall roofs and every glimpse of balustraded plazas in the first 3
lamps of evening served only to remind him of dreams he had once known, and 3
to make him homesick for ethereal lands he no longer knew how to find. Travel 3
was only a mockery; and even the Great War stirred him but little, though he 3
served from the first in the Foreign Legion of France. For a while he sought 3
friends, but soon grew weary of the crudeness of their emotions, and the 3
sameness and earthiness of their visions. He felt vaguely glad that all his 3
relatives were distant and out of touch with him, for they would not have 3
understood his mental life. That is, none but his grandfather and great-uncle 3
Christopher could, and they were long dead. 3
3
3
3
831 3
3
3
3
Then he began once more the writing of books, which he had left off when 3
dreams first failed him. But here, too, was there no satisfaction or fulfillment; for 3
the touch of earth was upon his mind, and he could not think of lovely things as 3
he had done of yore. Ironic humor dragged down all the twilight minarets he 3
reared, and the earthy fear of improbability blasted all the delicate and amazing 3
flowers in his faery gardens. The convention of assumed pity spilt mawkishness 3
on his characters, while the myth of an important reality and significant human 3
events and emotions debased all his high fantasy into thin-veiled allegory and 3
cheap social satire. His new novels were successful as his old ones had never 3
been; and because he knew how empty they must be to please an empty herd, he 3
burned them and ceased his writing. They were very graceful novels, in which 3
he urbanely laughed at the dreams he lightly sketched; but he saw that their 3
sophistication had sapped all their life away. 3
3
It was after this that he cultivated deliberate illusion, and dabbled in the notions 3
of the bizarre and the eccentric as an antidote for the commonplace. Most of 3
these, however, soon showed their poverty and barrenness; and he saw that the 3
popular doctrines of occultism are as dry and inflexible as those of science, yet 3
without even the slender palliative of truth to redeem them. Gross stupidity, 3
falsehood, and muddled thinking are not dream; and form no escape from life to 3
a mind trained above their own level. So Carter bought stranger books and 3
sought out deeper and more terrible men of fantastic erudition; delving into 3
arcana of consciousness that few have trod, and learning things about the secret 3
pits of life, legend, and immemorial antiquity which disturbed him ever 3
afterward. He decided to live on a rarer plane, and furnished his Boston home to 3
suit his changing moods; one room for each, hung in appropriate colours, 3
furnished with befitting books and objects, and provided with sources of the 3
proper sensations of light, heat, sound, taste, and odour. 3
3
Once he heard of a man in the south, who was shunned and feared for the 3
blasphemous things he read in prehistoric books and clay tablets smuggled from 3
India and Arabia. Him he visited, living with him and sharing his studies for 3
seven years, till horror overtook them one midnight in an unknown and archaic 3
graveyard, and only one emerged where two had entered. Then he went back to 3
Arkham, the terrible witch-haunted old town of his forefathers in New England, 3
and had experiences in the dark, amidst the hoary willows and tottering gambrel 3
roofs, which made him seal forever certain pages in the diary of a wild-minded 3
ancestor. But these horrors took him only to the edge of reality, and were not of 3
the true dream country he had known in youth; so that at fifty he despaired of 3
any rest or contentment in a world grown too busy for beauty and too shrewd 3
for dreams. 3
3
3
3
832 3
3
3
3
Having perceived at last the hollowness and futility of real things. Carter spent 3
his days in retirement, and in wistful disjointed memories of his dream-filled 3
youth. He thought it rather silly that he bothered to keep on living at all, and got 3
from a South American acquaintance a very curious liquid to take him to 3
oblivion without suffering. Inertia and force of habit, however, caused him to 3
defer action; and he lingered indecisively among thoughts of old times, taking 3
down the strange hangings from his walls and refitting the house as it was in his 3
early boyhood - purple panes, Victorian furniture, and all. 3
3
With the passage of time he became almost glad he had lingered, for his relics of 3
youth and his cleavage from the world made life and sophistication seem very 3
distant and unreal; so much so that a touch of magic and expectancy stole back 3
into his nightly slumbers. For years those slumbers had known only such twisted 3
reflections of every-day things as the commonest slumbers know, but now there 3
returned a flicker of something stranger and wilder; something of vaguely 3
awesome imminence which took the form of tensely clear pictures from his 3
childhood days, and made him think of little inconsequential things he had long 3
forgotten. He would often awake calling for his mother and grandfather, both in 3
their graves a quarter of a century. 3
3
Then one night his grandfather reminded him of the key. The grey old scholar, as 3
vivid as in life, spoke long and earnestly of their ancient line, and of the strange 3
visions of the delicate and sensitive men who composed it. He spoke of the 3
flame-eyed Crusader who learnt wild secrets of the Saracens that held him 3
captive; and of the first Sir Randolph Carter who studied magic when Elizabeth 3
was queen. He spoke, too, of that Edmund Carter who had just escaped hanging 3
in the Salem witchcraft, and who had placed in an antique box a great silver key 3
handed down from his ancestors. Before Carter awaked, the gentle visitant had 3
told him where to find that box; that carved oak box of archaic wonder whose 3
grotesque lid no hand had raised for two centuries. 3
3
In the dust and shadows of the great attic he found it, remote and forgotten at the 3
back of a drawer in a tall chest. It was about a foot square, and its Gothic 3
carvings were so fearful that he did not marvel no person since Edmund Carter 3
had dared to open it. It gave forth no noise when shaken, but was mystic with 3
the scent of unremembered spices. That it held a key was indeed only a dim 3
legend, and Randolph Carter's father had never known such a box existed. It was 3
bound in rusty iron, and no means was provided for working the formidable 3
lock. Carter vaguely understood that he would find within it some key to the lost 3
gate of dreams, but of where and how to use it his grandfather had told him 3
nothing. 3
3
3
3
833 3
3
3
3
An old servant forced the carven lid, shaking as he did so at the hideous faces 3
leering from the blackened wood, and at some unplaced familiarity. Inside, 3
wrapped in a discoloured parchment, was a huge key of tarnished silver covered 3
with cryptical arabesques; but of any legible explanation there was none. The 3
parchment was voluminous, and held only the strange hieroglyphs of an 3
unknown tongue written with an antique reed. Carter recognized the characters 3
as those he had seen on a certain papyrus scroll belonging to that terrible scholar 3
of the South who had vanished one midmght in a nameless cemetery. The man 3
had always shivered when he read this scroll, and Carter shivered now. 3
3
But he cleaned the key, and kept it by him nightly in its aromatic box of ancient 3
oak. His dreams were meanwhile increasing in vividness, and though showing 3
him none of the strange cities and incredible gardens of the old days, were 3
assuming a definite cast whose purpose could not be mistaken. They were 3
calling him back along the years, and with the mingled wills of all his fathers 3
were pulling him toward some hidden and ancestral source. Then he knew he 3
must go into the past and merge himself with old things, and day after day he 3
thought of the hills to the north where haunted Arkham and the rushing 3
Miskatonic and the lonely rustic homestead of his people lay. 3
3
In the brooding fire of autumn Carter took the old remembered way past 3
graceful lines of rolling hill and stone-walled meadow, distant vale and hanging 3
woodland, curving road and nestling farmstead, and the crystal windings of the 3
Miskatonic, crossed here and there by rustic bridges of wood or stone. At one 3
bend he saw the group of giant elms among which an ancestor had oddly 3
vanished a century and a half before, and shuddered as the wind blew 3
meaningly through them. Then there was the crumbling farmhouse of old Goody 3
Fowler the witch, with its little evil windows and great roof sloping nearly to the 3
ground on the north side. He speeded up his car as he passed it, and did not 3
slacken till he had mounted the hill where his mother and her fathers before her 3
were born, and where the old white house still looked proudly across the road at 3
the breathlessly lovely panorama of rocky slope and verdant valley, with the 3
distant spires of Kingsport on the horizon, and hints of the archaic, dream-laden 3
sea in the farthest background. 3
3
Then came the steeper slope that held the old Carter place he had not seen in 3
over forty years. Afternoon was far gone when he reached the foot, and at the 3
bend half way up he paused to scan the outspread countryside golden and 3
glorified in the slanting floods of magic poured out by a western sun. All the 3
strangeness and expectancy of his recent dreams seemed present in this hushed 3
and unearthly landscape, and he thought of the unknown solitudes of other 3
planets as his eyes traced out the velvet and deserted lawns shining undulant 3
between their tumbled walls, and clumps of faery forest setting off far lines of 3
3
3
3
834 3
3
3
3
purple hills beyond hills, and the spectral wooded valley dipping down in 3
shadow to dank hollows where trickling waters crooned and gurgled among 3
swollen and distorted roots. 3
3
Something made him feel that motors did not belong in the realm he was 3
seeking, so he left his car at the edge of the forest, and putting the great key in his 3
coat pocket walked on up the hill. Woods now engulfed him utterly, though he 3
knew the house was on a high knoll that cleared the trees except to the north. He 3
wondered how it would look, for it had been left vacant and untended through 3
his neglect since the death of his strange great-uncle Christopher thirty years 3
before. In his boyhood he had revelled through long visits there, and had found 3
weird marvels in the woods beyond the orchard. 3
3
Shadows thickened around him, for the night was near. Once a gap in the trees 3
opened up to the right, so that he saw off across leagues of twilight meadow and 3
spied the old Congregational steeple on Central Hill in Kingsport; pink with the 3
last flush of day, the panes of the little round windows blazing with reflected 3
fire. Then, when he was in deep shadow again, he recalled with a start that the 3
glimpse must have come from childish memory alone, since the old white church 3
had long been torn down to make room for the Congregational Hospital. He had 3
read of it with interest, for the paper had told about some strange burrows or 3
passages found in the rocky hill beneath. 3
3
Through his puzzlement a voice piped, and he started again at its familiarity 3
after long years. Old Benijah Corey had been his Uncle Christopher's hired man, 3
and was aged even in those far-off times of his boyhood visits. Now he must be 3
well over a hundred, but that piping voice could come from no one else. He 3
could distinguish no words, yet the tone was haunting and unmistakable. To 3
think that "Old Benijy" should still be aHve! 3
3
"Mister Randy! Mister Randy! Wharbe ye? D'ye want to skeer yer Aunt Marthy 3
plumb to death? Hain't she tuld ye to keep nigh the place in the arternoon an' git 3
back afur dark? Randy! Ran. . . dee!. . . He's the beatin'est boy fer runnin' off in the 3
woods I ever see; haff the time a-settin' moonin' raound that snake-den in the 3
upper timberlot! . . . Hey yew. Ran . . . dee!" 3
3
Randolph Carter stopped in the pitch darkness and rubbed his hand across his 3
eyes. Something was queer. He had been somewhere he ought not to be; had 3
strayed very far away to places where he had not belonged, and was now 3
inexcusably late. He had not noticed the time on the Kingsport steeple, though he 3
could easily have made it out with his pocket telescope; but he knew his lateness 3
was something very strange and unprecedented. He was not sure he had his 3
little telescope with him, and put his hand in his blouse pocket to see. No, it was 3
3
3
3
835 3
3
3
3
not there, but there was the big silver key he had found in a box somewhere. 3
Uncle Chris had told him something odd once about an old unopened box with a 3
key in it, but Aunt Martha had stopped the story abruptly, saying it was no kind 3
of thing to tell a child whose head was already too full of queer fancies. He tried 3
to recall just where he had found the key, but something seemed very confused. 3
He guessed it was in the attic at home in Boston, and dimly remembered bribing 3
Parks with half his week's allowance to help him open the box and keep quiet 3
about it; but when he remembered this, the face of Parks came up very strangely, 3
as if the wrinkles of long years had fallen upon the brisk little Cockney. 3
3
"Ran ... dee! Ran ... dee! Hi! Hi! Randy!" 3
3
A swaying lantern came around the black bend, and old Benijah pounced on the 3
silent and bewildered form of the pilgrim. 3
3
"Durn ye, boy, so thar ye be! Ain't ye got a tongue in yer head, that ye can't 3
answer a body! I ben callin' this haff hour, an' ye must a heerd me long ago! 3
Dun't ye know yer Aunt Marthy's all a-fidget over yer bein' off arter dark? Wait 3
till I tell yer Uncle Chris when he gits hum! Ye'd orta know these here woods 3
ain't no fitten place to be traipsin' this hour! They's things abroad what dun't do 3
nobody no good, as my gran'-sir knowed afur me. Come, Mister Randy, or 3
Hannah wunt keep supper no longer!" 3
3
So Randolph Carter was marched up the road where wondering stars glimmered 3
through high autumn boughs. And dogs barked as the yellow light of small- 3
paned windows shone out at the farther turn, and the Pleiades twinkled across 3
the open knoll where a great gambrel roof stood black against the dim west. 3
Aunt Martha was in the doorway, and did not scold too hard when Benijah 3
shoved the truant in. She knew Uncle Chris well enough to expect such things of 3
the Carter blood. Randolph did not show his key, but ate his supper in silence 3
and protested only when bedtime came. He sometimes dreamed better when 3
awake, and he wanted to use that key. 3
3
In the morning Randolph was up early, and would have run off to the upper 3
timberlot if Uncle Chris had not caught him and forced him into his chair by the 3
breakfast table. He looked impatiently around the low-pitched room with the rag 3
carpet and exposed beams and corner-posts, and smiled only when the orchard 3
boughs scratched at the leaded panes of the rear window. The trees and the hills 3
were close to him, and formed the gates of that timeless realm which was his true 3
country. 3
3
Then, when he was free, he felt in his blouse pocket for the key; and being 3
reassured, skipped off across the orchard to the rise beyond, where the wooded 3
3
3
3
836 3
3
3
3
hill climbed again to heights above even the treeless knoll. The floor of the forest 3
was mossy and mysterious, and great lichened rocks rose vaguely here and there 3
in the dim light like Druid monoliths among the swollen and twisted trunks of a 3
sacred grove. Once in his ascent Randolph crossed a rushing stream whose falls a 3
little way off sang runic incantations to the lurking fauns and aegipans and 3
dryads. 3
3
Then he came to the strange cave in the forest slope, the dreaded "snake-den" 3
which country folk shunned, and away from which Benijah had warned him 3
again and again. It was deep; far deeper than anyone but Randolph suspected, 3
for the boy had found a fissure in the farthermost black corner that led to a loftier 3
grotto beyond - a haunting sepulchral place whose granite walls held a curious 3
illusion of conscious artifice. On this occasion he crawled in as usual, lighting his 3
way with matches filched from the sitting-room matchsafe, and edging through 3
the final crevice with an eagerness hard to explain even to himself. He could not 3
tell why he approached the farther wall so confidently, or why he instinctively 3
drew forth the great silver key as he did so. But on he went, and when he danced 3
back to the house that night he offered no excuses for his lateness, nor heeded in 3
the least the reproofs he gained for ignoring the noon-tide dinner-horn 3
altogether. 3
3
Now it is agreed by all the distant relatives of Randolph Carter that something 3
occurred to heighten his imagination in his tenth year. His cousin, Ernest B. 3
Aspinwall, Esq., of Chicago, is fully ten years his senior; and distinctly recalls a 3
change in the boy after the autumn of 1883. Randolph had looked on scenes of 3
fantasy that few others can ever have beheld, and stranger still were some of the 3
qualities which he showed in relation to very mundane things. He seemed, in 3
fine, to have picked up an odd gift of prophecy; and reacted unusually to things 3
which, though at the time without meaning, were later found to justify the 3
singular impressions. In subsequent decades as new inventions, new names, and 3
new events appeared one by one in the book of history, people would now and 3
then recall wonderingly how Carter had years before let fall some careless word 3
of undoubted connection with what was then far in the future. He did not 3
himself understand these words, or know why certain things made him feel 3
certain emotions; but fancied that some unremembered dream must be 3
responsible. It was as early as 1897 that he turned pale when some traveller 3
mentioned the French town of Belloy-en-Santerre, and friends remembered it 3
when he was almost mortally wounded there in 1916, while serving with the 3
Foreign Legion in the Great War. 3
3
Carter's relatives talk much of these things because he has lately disappeared. 3
His little old servant Parks, who for years bore patiently with his vagaries, last 3
saw him on the morning he drove off alone in his car with a key he had recently 3
3
3
3
837 3
3
3
3
found. Parks had helped him get the key from the old box containing it, and had 3
felt strangely affected by the grotesque carvings on the box, and by some other 3
odd quality he could not name. When Carter left, he had said he was going to 3
visit his old ancestral country around Arkham. 3
3
Half way up Elm Mountain, on the way to the ruins of the old Carter place, they 3
found his motor set carefully by the roadside; and in it was a box of fragrant 3
wood with carvings that frightened the countrymen who stumbled on it. The box 3
held only a queer parchment whose characters no linguist or palaeographer has 3
been able to decipher or identify. Rain had long effaced any possible footprints, 3
though Boston investigators had something to say about evidences of 3
disturbances among the fallen timbers of the Carter place. It was, they averred, 3
as though someone had groped about the ruins at no distant period. A common 3
white handkerchief found among forest rocks on the hillside beyond cannot be 3
identified as belonging to the missing man. 3
3
There is talk of apportioning Randolph Carter's estate among his heirs, but I shall 3
stand firmly against this course because I do not believe he is dead. There are 3
twists of time and space, of vision and reality, which only a dreamer can divine; 3
and from what I know of Carter I think he has merely found a way to traverse 3
these mazes. Whether or not he will ever come back, I cannot say. He wanted the 3
lands of dream he had lost, and yearned for the days of his childhood. Then he 3
found a key, and I somehow believe he was able to use it to strange advantage. 3
3
I shall ask him when I see him, for I expect to meet him shortly in a certain 3
dream-city we both used to haunt. It is rumoured in Ulthar, beyond the River 3
Skai, that a new king reigns on the opal throne of Ilek-Vad, that fabulous town of 3
turrets atop the hollow cliffs of glass overlooking the twilight sea wherein the 3
bearded and finny Gnorri build their singular labyrinths, and I believe I know 3
how to interpret this rumour. Certainly, I look forward impatiently to the sight of 3
that great silver key, for in its cryptical arabesques there may stand symbolised 3
all the aims and mysteries of a blindly impersonal cosmos. 3

The Statement of Randolph Carter 3
3
Written in 1919 3
3
Published in May of 1920 in The Vagrant 3
3
I repeat to you, gentlemen, that your inquisition is fruitless. Detain me here 3
forever if you will; confine or execute me if you must have a victim to propitiate 3
the illusion you call justice; but I can say no more than I have said already. 3
Everything that I can remember, I have told you with perfect candour. Nothing 3
has been distorted or concealed, and if anything remains vague, it is only 3
because of the dark cloud which has come over my mind — that cloud and the 3
nebulous nature of the horrors which brought it upon me. 3
3
Again I say, I do not know what has become of Harley Warren, though I think — 3
almost hope — that he is in peaceful oblivion, if there be anywhere so blessed a 3
thing. It is true that I have for five years been his closest friend, and a partial 3
sharer of his terrible researches into the unknown. I will not deny, though my 3
memory is uncertain and indistinct, that this witness of yours may have seen us 3
together as he says, on the Gainsville pike, walking toward Big Cypress Swamp, 3
at half past 11 on that awful night. That we bore electric lanterns, spades, and a 3
curious coil of wire with attached instruments, I will even affirm; for these things 3
all played a part in the single hideous scene which remains burned into my 3
shaken recollection. But of what followed, and of the reason I was found alone 3
and dazed on the edge of the swamp next morning, I must insist that I know 3
nothing save what I have told you over and over again. You say to me that there 3
is nothing in the swamp or near it which could form the setting of that frightful 3
episode. I reply that I knew nothing beyond what I saw. Vision or nightmare it 3
may have been — vision or nightmare I fervently hope it was — yet it is all that 3
my mind retains of what took place in those shocking hours after we left the 3
sight of men. And why Harley Warren did not return, he or his shade — or some 3
nameless thing I cannot describe — alone can tell. 3
3
As I have said before, the weird studies of Harley Warren were well known to 3
me, and to some extent shared by me. Of his vast collection of strange, rare books 3
on forbidden subjects I have read all that are written in the languages of which I 3
am master; but these are few as compared with those in languages I cannot 3
understand. Most, I believe, are in Arabic; and the fiend-inspired book which 3
brought on the end — the book which he carried in his pocket out of the world 3
— was written in characters whose like I never saw elsewhere. Warren would 3
never tell me just what was in that book. As to the nature of our studies — must I 3
say again that I no longer retain full comprehension? It seems to me rather 3
3
3
3
839 3
3
3
3
merciful that I do not, for they were terrible studies, which I pursued more 3
through reluctant fascination than through actual inclination. Warren always 3
dominated me, and sometimes I feared him. I remember how I shuddered at his 3
facial expression on the night before the awful happening, when he talked so 3
incessantly of his theory, why certain corpses never decay, but rest firm and fat 3
in their tombs for a thousand years. But I do not fear him now, for I suspect that 3
he has known horrors beyond my ken. Now I fear for him. 3
3
Once more I say that I have no clear idea of our object on that night. Certainly, it 3
had much to do with something in the book which Warren carried with him — 3
that ancient book in undecipherable characters which had come to him from 3
India a month before — but I swear I do not know what it was that we expected 3
to find. Your witness says he saw us at half past 11 on the Gainsville pike, 3
headed for Big Cypress Swamp. This is probably true, but I have no distinct 3
memory of it. The picture seared into my soul is of one scene only, and the hour 3
must have been long after midnight; for a waning crescent moon was high in the 3
vaporous heavens. 3
3
The place was an ancient cemetery; so ancient that I trembled at the manifold 3
signs of immemorial years. It was in a deep, damp hollow, overgrown with rank 3
grass, moss, and curious creeping weeds, and filled with a vague stench which 3
my idle fancy associated absurdly with rotting stone. On every hand were the 3
signs of neglect and decrepitude, and I seemed haunted by the notion that 3
Warren and I were the first living creatures to invade a lethal silence of centuries. 3
Over the valley's rim a wan, waning crescent moon peered through the noisome 3
vapors that seemed to emanate from unheard of catacombs, and by its feeble, 3
wavering beams I could distinguish a repellent array of antique slabs, urns, 3
cenotaphs, and mausoleum facades; all crumbling, moss-grown, and moisture- 3
stained, and partly concealed by the gross luxuriance of the unhealthy 3
vegetation. 3
3
My first vivid impression of my own presence in this terrible necropolis concerns 3
the act of pausing with Warren before a certain half-obliterated sepulcher and of 3
throwing down some burdens which we seemed to have been carrying. I now 3
observed that I had with me an electric lantern and two spades, whilst my 3
companion was supplied with a similar lantern and a portable telephone outfit. 3
No word was uttered, for the spot and the task seemed known to us; and without 3
delay we seized our spades and commenced to clear away the grass, weeds, and 3
drifted earth from the flat, archaic mortuary. After uncovering the entire surface, 3
which consisted of three immense granite slabs, we stepped back some distance 3
to survey the charnel scene; and Warren appeared to make some mental 3
calculations. Then he returned to the sepulcher, and using his spade as a lever, 3
sought to pry up the slab lying nearest to a stony ruin which may have been a 3
3
3
3
840 3
3
3
3
monument in its day. He did not succeed, and motioned to me to come to his 3
assistance. Finally our combined strength loosened the stone, which we raised 3
and tipped to one side. 3
3
The removal of the slab revealed a black aperture, from which rushed an 3
effluence of miasmal gases so nauseous that we started back in horror. After an 3
interval, however, we approached the pit again, and found the exhalations less 3
unbearable. Our lanterns disclosed the top of a flight of stone steps, dripping 3
with some detestable ichor of the inner earth, and bordered by moist walls 3
encrusted with niter. And now for the first time my memory records verbal 3
discourse, Warren addressing me at length in his mellow tenor voice; a voice 3
singularly unperturbed by our awesome surroundings. 3
3
"I'm sorry to have to ask you to stay on the surface," he said, "but it would be a 3
crime to let anyone with your frail nerves go down there. You can't imagine, 3
even from what you have read and from what I've told you, the things I shall 3
have to see and do. It's fiendish work. Carter, and I doubt if any man without 3
ironclad sensibilities could ever see it through and come up alive and sane. I 3
don't wish to offend you, and Heaven knows I'd be glad enough to have you 3
with me; but the responsibility is in a certain sense mine, and I couldn't drag a 3
bundle of nerves like you down to probable death or madness. I tell you, you 3
can't imagine what the thing is really like! But I promise to keep you informed 3
over the telephone of every move — you see I've enough wire here to reach to 3
the center of the earth and back!" 3
3
I can still hear, in memory, those coolly spoken words; and I can still remember 3
my remonstrances. I seemed desperately anxious to accompany my friend into 3
those sepulchral depths, yet he proved inflexibly obdurate. At one time he 3
threatened to abandon the expedition if I remained insistent; a threat which 3
proved effective, since he alone held the key to the thing. All this I can still 3
remember, though I no longer know what manner of thing we sought. After he 3
had obtained my reluctant acquiescence in his design, Warren picked up the reel 3
of wire and adjusted the instruments. At his nod I took one of the latter and 3
seated myself upon an aged, discolored gravestone close by the newly uncovered 3
aperture. Then he shook my hand, shouldered the coil of wire, and disappeared 3
within that indescribable ossuary. 3
3
For a minute I kept sight of the glow of his lantern, and heard the rustle of the 3
wire as he laid it down after him; but the glow soon disappeared abruptly, as if a 3
turn in the stone staircase had been encountered, and the sound died away 3
almost as quickly. I was alone, yet bound to the unknown depths by those magic 3
strands whose insulated surface lay green beneath the struggling beams of that 3
waning crescent moon. 3
3
3
3
841 3
3
3
3
I constantly consulted my watch by the light of my electric lantern, and listened 3
with feverish anxiety at the receiver of the telephone; but for more than a quarter 3
of an hour heard nothing. Then a faint clicking came from the instrument, and I 3
called down to my friend in a tense voice. Apprehensive as I was, I was 3
nevertheless unprepared for the words which came up from that uncanny vault 3
in accents more alarmed and quivering than any I had heard before from Harley 3
Warren. He who had so calmly left me a little while previously, now called from 3
below in a shaky whisper more portentous than the loudest shriek: 3
3
"God! If you could see what I am seeing!" 3
3
I could not answer. Speechless, I could only wait. Then came the frenzied tones 3
again: 3
3
"Carter, it's terrible — monstrous — unbelievable!" 3
3
This time my voice did not fail me, and I poured into the transmitter a flood of 3
excited questions. Terrified, I continued to repeat, "Warren, what is it? What is 3
it?" 3
3
Once more came the voice of my friend, still hoarse with fear, and now 3
apparently tinged with despair: 3
3
"I can't tell you. Carter! It's too utterly beyond thought — I dare not tell you — 3
no man could know it and live — Great God! I never dreamed of this!" 3
3
Stillness again, save for my now incoherent torrent of shuddering inquiry. Then 3
the voice of Warren in a pitch of wilder consternation: 3
3
"Carter! for the love of God, put back the slab and get out of this if you can! 3
Quick! — leave everything else and make for the outside — it's your only 3
chance! Do as I say, and don't ask me to explain!" 3
3
I heard, yet was able only to repeat my frantic questions. Around me were the 3
tombs and the darkness and the shadows; below me, some peril beyond the 3
radius of the human imagination. But my friend was in greater danger than I, 3
and through my fear I felt a vague resentment that he should deem me capable 3
of deserting him under such circumstances. More clicking, and after a pause a 3
piteous cry from Warren: 3
3
"Beat it! For God's sake, put back the slab and beat it. Carter!" 3
3
Something in the boyish slang of my evidently stricken companion unleashed 3
my faculties. I formed and shouted a resolution, "Warren, brace up! I'm coming 3
3
3
3
842 3
3
3
3
down!" But at this offer the tone of my auditor changed to a scream of utter 3
despair: 3
3
"Don't! You can't understand! It's too late — and my own fault. Put back the slab 3
and run — there's nothing else you or anyone can do now!" 3
3
The tone changed again, this time acquiring a softer quality, as of hopeless 3
resignation. Yet it remained tense through anxiety for me. 3
3
"Quick - before it's too late!" 3
3
I tried not to heed him; tried to break through the paralysis which held me, and 3
to fulfil my vow to rush down to his aid. But his next whisper found me still held 3
inert in the chains of stark horror. 3
3
"Carter — hurry! It's no use — you must go — better one than two — the slab — 3
3
3
3
A pause, more clicking, then the faint voice of Warren: 3
3
"Nearly over now — don't make it harder — cover up those damned steps and 3
run for your life — you're losing time — so long. Carter — won't see you again." 3
3
Here Warren's whisper swelled into a cry; a cry that gradually rose to a shriek 3
fraught with all the horror of the ages — 3
3
"Curse these hellish things - legions - My God! Beat it! Beat it! BEAT IT!" 3
3
After that was silence. I know not how many interminable eons I sat stupefied; 3
whispering, muttering, calling, screaming into that telephone. Over and over 3
again through those eons I whispered and muttered, called, shouted, and 3
screamed, "Warren! Warren! Answer me — are you there?" 3
3
And then there came to me the crowning horror of all — the unbelievable, 3
unthinkable, almost unmentionable thing. I have said that eons seemed to elapse 3
after Warren shrieked forth his last despairing warning, and that only my own 3
cries now broke the hideous silence. But after a while there was a further clicking 3
in the receiver, and I strained my ears to listen. Again I called down, "Warren, 3
are you there?" and in answer heard the thing which has brought this cloud over 3
my mind. I do not try, gentlemen, to account for that thing — that voice — nor 3
can I venture to describe it in detail, since the first words took away my 3
consciousness and created a mental blank which reaches to the time of my 3
awakening in the hospital. Shall I say that the voice was deep; hollow; 3
gelatinous; remote; unearthly; inhuman; disembodied? What shall I say? It was 3
3
3
3
843 3
3
3
3
the end of my experience, and is the end of my story. I heard it, and knew no 3
more — heard it as I sat petrified in that unknown cemetery in the hollow, 3
amidst the crumbling stones and the falling tombs, the rank vegetation and the 3
miasmal vapors — heard it well up from the innermost depths of that damnable 3
open sepulcher as I watched amorphous, necrophagous shadows dance beneath 3
an accursed waning moon. 3
3
And this is what it said: 3
3
"You fool, Warren is DEAD!" 3

The Strange High House in the Mist 3
3
Written November 9,1926 3
3
Published October 1931 in Weird Tales 3
3
In the morning, mist comes up from the sea by the cliffs beyond Kingsport. 3
White and feathery it comes from the deep to its brothers the clouds, full of 3
dreams of dank pastures and caves of leviathan. And later, in still summer rains 3
on the steep roofs of poets, the clouds scatter bits of those dreams, that men shall 3
not live without rumor of old strange secrets, and wonders that planets tell 3
planets alone in the night. When tales fly thick in the grottoes of tritons, and 3
conchs in seaweed cities blow wild tunes learned from the Elder Ones, then great 3
eager mists flock to heaven laden with lore, and oceanward eyes on tile rocks see 3
only a mystic whiteness, as if the cliff's rim were the rim of all earth, and the 3
solemn bells of buoys tolled free in the aether of faery. 3
3
Now north of archaic Kingsport the crags climb lofty and curious, terrace on 3
terrace, till the northernmost hangs in the sky like a gray frozen wind-cloud. 3
Alone it is, a bleak point jutting in limitless space, for there the coast turns sharp 3
where the great Miskatonic pours out of the plains past Arkham, bringing 3
woodland legends and little quaint memories of New England's hills. The sea- 3
folk of Kingsport look up at that cliff as other sea-folk look up at the pole-star, 3
and time the night's watches by the way it hides or shows the Great Bear, 3
Cassiopeia and the Dragon. Among them it is one with the firmament, and truly, 3
it is hidden from them when the mist hides the stars or the sun. 3
3
Some of the cliffs they love, as that whose grotesque profile they call Father 3
Neptune, or that whose pillared steps they term "The Causeway"; but this one 3
they fear because it is so near the sky. The Portuguese sailors coming in from a 3
voyage cross themselves when they first see it, and the old Yankees believe it 3
would be a much graver matter than death to climb it, if indeed that were 3
possible. Nevertheless there is an ancient house on that cliff, and at evening men 3
see lights in the small-paned windows. 3
3
The ancient house has always been there, and people say One dwells within who 3
talks with the morning mists that come up from the deep, and perhaps sees 3
singular things oceanward at those times when the cliff's rim becomes the rim of 3
all earth, and solemn buoys toll free in the white aether of faery. This they tell 3
from hearsay, for that forbidding crag is always unvisited, and natives dislike to 3
train telescopes on it. Summer boarders have indeed scanned it with jaunty 3
binoculars, but have never seen more than the gray primeval roof, peaked and 3
3
3
3
845 3
3
3
3
shingled, whose eaves come nearly to the gray foundations, and the dim yellow 3
light of the little windows peeping out from under those eaves in the dusk. These 3
summer people do not believe that the same One has lived in the ancient house 3
for hundreds of years, but can not prove their heresy to any real Kingsporter. 3
Even the Terrible Old Man who talks to leaden pendulums in bottles, buys 3
groceries with centuried Spanish gold, and keeps stone idols in the yard of his 3
antediluvian cottage in Water Street can only say these things were the same 3
when his grandfather was a boy, and that must have been inconceivable ages 3
ago, when Belcher or Shirley or Pownall or Bernard was Governor of His 3
Majesty's Province of the Massachusetts-Bay. 3
3
Then one summer there came a philosopher into Kingsport. His name was 3
Thomas Olney, and he taught ponderous things in a college by Narragansett Bay. 3
With stout wife and romping children he came, and his eyes were weary with 3
seeing the same things for many years, and thinking the same well-disciplined 3
thoughts. He looked at the mists from the diadem of Father Neptune, and tried 3
to walk into their white world of mystery along the titan steps of The Causeway. 3
Morning after morning he would lie on the cliffs and look over the world's rim at 3
the cryptical aether beyond, listening to spectral bells and the wild cries of what 3
might have been gulls. Then, when the mist would lift and the sea stand out 3
prosy with the smoke of steamers, he would sigh and descend to the town, 3
where he loved to thread the narrow olden lanes up and down hill, and study 3
the crazy tottering gables and odd-pillared doorways which had sheltered so 3
many generations of sturdy sea-folk. And he even talked with the Terrible Old 3
Man, who was not fond of strangers, and was invited into his fearsomely archaic 3
cottage where low ceilings and wormy panelling hear the echoes of disquieting 3
soliloquies in the dark small hours. 3
3
Of course it was inevitable that Olney should mark the gray unvisited cottage in 3
the sky, on that sinister northward crag which is one with the mists and the 3
firmament. Always over Kingsport it hung, and always its mystery sounded in 3
whispers through 3
3
Kingsport's crooked alleys. The Terrible Old Man wheezed a tale that his father 3
had told him, of lightning that shot one night up from that peaked cottage to the 3
clouds of higher heaven; and Granny Orne, whose tiny gambrel-roofed abode in 3
Ship Street is all covered with moss and ivy, croaked over something her 3
grandmother had heard at second-hand, about shapes that flapped out of the 3
eastern mists straight into the narrow single door of that unreachable place - for 3
the door is set close to the edge of the crag toward the ocean, and glimpsed only 3
from ships at sea. 3
3
3
3
846 3
3
3
3
At length, being avid for new strange things and held back by neither the 3
Kingsporter's fear nor the summer boarder's usual indolence, Olney made a very 3
terrible resolve. Despite a conservative training - or because of it, for humdrum 3
lives breed wistful longings of the unknown - he swore a great oath to scale that 3
avoided northern cliff and visit the abnormally antique gray cottage in the sky. 3
Very plausibly his saner self argued that the place must be tenanted by people 3
who reached it from inland along the easier ridge beside the Miskatonic's 3
estuary. Probably they traded in Arkham, knowing how little Kingsport liked 3
their habitation or perhaps being unable to climb down the cliff on the Kingsport 3
side. Olney walked out along the lesser cliffs to where the great crag leaped 3
insolently up to consort with celestial things, and became very sure that no 3
human feet could mount it or descend it on that beetling southern slope. East 3
and north it rose thousands of feet perpendicular from the water so only the 3
western side, inland and toward Arkham, remained. 3
3
One early morning in August Olney set out to find a path to the inaccessible 3
pinnacle. He worked northwest along pleasant back roads, past Hooper's Pond 3
and the old brick powder-house to where the pastures slope up to the ridge 3
above the Miskatonic and give a lovely vista of Arkham's white Georgian 3
steeples across leagues of river and meadow. Here he found a shady road to 3
Arkham, but no trail at all in the seaward direction he wished. Woods and fields 3
crowded up to the high bank of the river's mouth, and bore not a sign of man's 3
presence; not even a stone wall or a straying cow, but only the tall grass and 3
giant trees and tangles of briars that the first Indian might have seen. As he 3
climbed slowly east, higher and higher above the estuary on his left and nearer 3
and nearer the sea, he found the way growing in difficulty till he wondered how 3
ever the dwellers in that disliked place managed to reach the world outside, and 3
whether they came often to market in Arkham. 3
3
Then the trees thinned, and far below him on his right he saw the hills and 3
antique roofs and spires of Kingsport. Even Central Hill was a dwarf from this 3
height, and he could just make out the ancient graveyard by the Congregational 3
Hospital beneath which rumor said some terrible caves or burrows lurked. 3
Ahead lay sparse grass and scrub blueberry bushes, and beyond them the naked 3
rock of the crag and the thin peak of the dreaded gray cottage. Now the ridge 3
narrowed, and Olney grew dizzy at his loneness in the sky, south of him the 3
frightful precipice above Kingsport, north of him the vertical drop of nearly a 3
mile to the river's mouth. Suddenly a great chasm opened before him, ten feet 3
deep, so that he had to let himself down by his hands and drop to a slanting 3
floor, and then crawl perilously up a natural defile in the opposite wall. So this 3
was the way the folk of the uncanny house journeyed betwixt earth and sky! 3
3
3
3
847 3
3
3
3
When he chmbed out of the chasm a morning mist was gathering, but he clearly 3
saw the lofty and unhallowed cottage ahead; walls as gray as the rock, and high 3
peak standing bold against the milky white of the seaward vapors. And he 3
perceived that there was no door on this landward end, but only a couple of 3
small lattice windows with dingy bull's-eye panes leaded in seventeenth century 3
fashion. All around him was cloud and chaos, and he could see nothing below 3
the whiteness of illimitable space. He was alone in the sky with this queer and 3
very disturbing house; and when he sidled around to the front and saw that the 3
wall stood flush with the cliff's edge, so that the single narrow door was not to be 3
reached save from the empty aether, he felt a distinct terror that altitude could 3
not wholly explain. And it was very odd that shingles so worm-eaten could 3
survive, or bricks so crumbled still form a standing chimney. 3
3
As the mist thickened, Olney crept around to the windows on the north and west 3
and south sides, trying them but finding them all locked. He was vaguely glad 3
they were locked, because the more he saw of that house the less he wished to 3
get in. Then a sound halted him. He heard a lock rattle and a bolt shoot, and a 3
long creaking follow as if a heavy door were slowly and cautiously opened. This 3
was on the oceanward side that he could not see, where the narrow portal 3
opened on blank space thousands of feet in the misty sky above the waves. 3
3
Then there was heavy, deliberate tramping in the cottage, and Olney heard the 3
windows opening, first on the north side opposite him, and then on the west just 3
around the corner. Next would come the south windows, under the great low 3
eaves on the side where he stood; and it must be said that he was more than 3
uncomfortable as he thought of the detestable house on one side and the vacancy 3
of upper air on the other. When a fumbling came in the nearer casements he 3
crept around to the west again, flattening himself against the wall beside the now 3
opened windows. It was plain that the owner had come home; but he had not 3
come from the land, nor from any balloon or airship that could be imagined. 3
Steps sounded again, and Olney edged round to the north; but before he could 3
find a haven a voice called softly, and he knew he must confront his host. 3
3
Stuck out of the west window was a great black-bearded face whose eyes were 3
phosphorescent with the imprint of unheard-of sights. But the voice was gentle, 3
and of a quaint olden kind, so that Olney did not shudder when a brown hand 3
reached out to help him over the sill and into that low room of black oak 3
wainscots and carved Tudor furnishings. The man was clad in very ancient 3
garments, and had about him an unplaceable nimbus of sea-lore and dreams of 3
tall galleons. Olney does not recall many of the wonders he told, or even who he 3
was; but says that he was strange and kindly, and filled with the magic of 3
unfathomed voids of time and space. The small room seemed green with a dim 3
3
3
3
848 3
3
3
3
aqueous light, and Olney saw that the far windows to the east were not open, but 3
shut against the misty aether with dull panes like the bottoms of old bottles. 3
3
That bearded host seemed young, yet looked out of eyes steeped in the elder 3
mysteries; and from the tales of marvelous ancient things he related, it must be 3
guessed that the village folk were right in saying he had communed with the 3
mists of the sea and the clouds of the sky ever since there was any village to 3
watch his taciturn dwelling from the plain below. And the day wore on, and still 3
Olney listened to rumors of old times and far places, and heard how the kings of 3
Atlantis fought with the slippery blasphemies that wriggled out of rifts in 3
ocean's floor, and how the pillared and weedy temple of Poseidon is still 3
glimpsed at midnight by lost ships, who knew by its sight that they are lost. 3
Years of the Titans were recalled, but the host grew timid when he spoke of the 3
dim first age of chaos before the gods or even the Elder Ones were born, and 3
when the other gods came to dance on the peak of Hatheg-Kia in the stony desert 3
near Ulthar, beyond the River Skai. 3
3
It was at this point that there came a knocking on the door; that ancient door of 3
nail-studded oak beyond which lay only the abyss of white cloud. Olney started 3
in fright, but the bearded man motioned him to be still, and tiptoed to the door to 3
look out through a very small peephole. What he saw he did not like, so pressed 3
his fingers to his lips and tiptoed around to shut and lock all the windows before 3
returning to the ancient settle beside his guest. Then Olney saw lingering against 3
the translucent squares of each of the little dim windows in succession a queer 3
black outline as the caller moved inquisitively about before leaving; and he was 3
glad his host had not answered the knocking. For there are strange objects in the 3
great abyss, and the seeker of dreams must take care not to stir up or meet the 3
wrong ones. 3
3
Then the shadows began to gather; first little furtive ones under the table, and 3
then bolder ones in the dark panelled corners. And the bearded man made 3
enigmatical gestures of prayer, and lit tall candles in curiously wrought brass 3
candle-sticks. Frequently he would glance at the door as if he expected some one, 3
and at length his glance seemed answered by a singular rapping which must 3
have followed some very ancient and secret code. This time he did not even 3
glance through the peep-hole, but swung the great oak bar and shot the bolt, 3
unlatching the heavy door and flinging it wide to the stars and the mist. 3
3
And then to the sound of obscure harmonies there floated into that room from 3
the deep all the dreams and memories of earth's sunken Mighty Ones. And 3
golden flames played about weedy locks, so that Olney was dazzled as he did 3
them homage. Trident-bearing Neptune was there, and sportive tritons and 3
fantastic nereids, and upon dolphins' backs was balanced a vast crenulate shell 3
3
3
3
849 3
3
3
3
wherein rode the gay and awful form of primal Nodens, Lord of the Great 3
Abyss. And the conchs of the tritons gave weird blasts, and the nereids made 3
strange sounds by striking on the grotesque resonant shells of unknown lurkers 3
in black seacaves. Then hoary Nodens reached forth a wizened hand and helped 3
Olney and his host into the vast shell, whereat the conchs and the gongs set up a 3
wild and awesome clamor. And out into the limitless aether reeled that fabulous 3
train, the noise of whose shouting was lost in the echoes of thunder. 3
3
All night in Kingsport they watched that lofty cliff when the storm and the mists 3
gave them glimpses of it, and when toward the small hours the little dim 3
windows went dark they whispered of dread and disaster. And Olney's children 3
and stout wife prayed to the bland proper god of Baptists, and hoped that the 3
traveller would borrow an umbrella and rubbers unless the rain stopped by 3
morning. Then dawn swam dripping and mist-wreathed out of the sea, and the 3
buoys tolled solemn in vortices of white aether. And at noon elfin horns rang 3
over the ocean as Olney, dry and lightfooted, climbed down from the cliffs to 3
antique Kingsport with the look of far places in his eyes. He could not recall 3
what he had dreamed in the skyperched hut of that still nameless hermit, or say 3
how he had crept down that crag untraversed by other feet. Nor could he talk of 3
these matters at all save with the Terrible Old Man, who afterward mumbled 3
queer things in his long white beard; vowing that the man who came down from 3
that crag was not wholly the man who went up, and that somewhere under that 3
gray peaked roof, or amidst inconceivable reaches of that sinister white mist, 3
there lingered still the lost spirit of him who was Thomas Obey. 3
3
And ever since that hour, through dull dragging years of grayness and 3
weariness, the philosopher has labored and eaten and slept and done 3
uncomplaining the suitable deeds of a citizen. Not any more does he long for the 3
magic of farther hills, or sigh for secrets that peer like green reefs from a 3
bottomless sea. The sameness of his days no longer gives him sorrow and well- 3
disciplined thoughts have grown enough for his imagination. His good wife 3
waxes stouter and his children older and prosier and more useful, and he never 3
fails to smile correctly with pride when the occasion calls for it. In his glance 3
there is not any restless light, and all he ever listens for solemn bells or far elfin 3
horns it is only at night when old dreams are wandering. He has never seen 3
Kingsport again, for his family disliked the funny old houses and complained 3
that the drains were impossibly bad. They have a trim bungalow now at Bristol 3
Highlands, where no tall crags tower, and the neighbors are urban and modern. 3
3
But in Kingsport strange tales are abroad, and even the Terrible Old Man admits 3
a thing untold by his grandfather. For now, when the wind sweeps boisterous 3
out of the north past the high ancient house that is one with the firmament, there 3
is broken at last that ominous, brooding silence ever before the bane of 3
3
3
3
850 3
3
3
3
Kingsport's maritime cotters. And old folk tell of pleasing voices heard singing 3
there, and of laughter that swells with joys beyond earth's joys; and say that at 3
evening the little low windows are brighter than formerly. They say, too, that the 3
fierce aurora comes oftener to that spot, shining blue in the north with visions of 3
frozen worlds while the crag and the cottage hang black and fantastic against 3
wild coruscations. And the mists of the dawn are thicker, and sailors are not 3
quite so sure that all the muffled seaward ringing is that of the solemn buoys. 3
3
Worst of all, though, is the shrivelling of old fears in the hearts of Kingsport's 3
young men, who grow prone to listen at night to the north wind's faint distant 3
sounds. They swear no harm or pain can inhabit that high peaked cottage, for in 3
the new voices gladness beats, and with them the tinkle of laughter and music. 3
What tales the sea-mists may bring to that haunted and northernmost pinnacle 3
they do not know, but they long to extract some hint of the wonders that knock 3
at the cliff-yawning door when clouds are thickest. And patriarchs dread lest 3
some day one by one they seek out that inaccessible peak in the sky, and learn 3
what centuried secrets hide beneath the steep shingled roof which is part of the 3
rocks and the stars and the ancient fears of Kingsport. That those venturesome 3
youths will come back they do not doubt, but they think a light may be gone 3
from their eyes, and a will from their hearts. And they do not wish quaint 3
Kingsport with its climbing lanes and archaic gables to drag listless down the 3
years while voice by voice the laughing chorus grows stronger and wilder in that 3
unknown and terrible eyrie where mists and the dreams of mists stop to rest on 3
their way from the sea to the skies. 3
3
They do not wish the souls of their young men to leave the pleasant hearths and 3
gambrel-roofed taverns of old Kingsport, nor do they wish the laughter and song 3
in that high rocky place to grow louder. For as the voice which has come has 3
brought fresh mists from the sea and from the north fresh lights, so do they say 3
that still other voices will bring more mists and more lights, till perhaps the 3
olden gods (whose existence they hint only in whispers for fear the 3
Congregational parson shall hear} may come out of the deep and from unknown 3
Kadath in the cold waste and make their dwelling on that evilly appropriate crag 3
so close to the gentle hills and valleys of quiet, simple fisher folk. This they do 3
not wish, for to plain people things not of earth are unwelcome; and besides, the 3
Terrible Old Man often recalls what Olney said about a knock that the lone 3
dweller feared, and a shape seen black and inquisitive against the mist through 3
those queer translucent windows of leaded bull's-eyes. 3
3
All these things, however, the Elder Ones only may decide; and meanwhile the 3
morning mist still comes up by that lovely vertiginous peak with the steep 3
ancient house, that gray, low-eaved house where none is seen but where evening 3
brings furtive lights while the north wind tells of strange revels, white and 3
3
3
3
851 3
3
3
3
feathery it comes from the deep to its brothers the clouds, full of dreams of dank 3
pastures and caves of leviathan. And when tales fly thick in the grottoes of 3
tritons, and conchs in seaweed cities blow wild tunes learned from the Elder 3
Ones, then great eager vapors flock to heaven laden with lore; and Kingsport, 3
nestling uneasy in its lesser cliffs below that awesome hanging sentinel of rock, 3
sees oceanward only a mystic whiteness, as if the cliff's rim were the rim of all 3
earth, and the solemn bells of the buoys tolled free in the aether of faery. 3

The Street 3

Published in December of 1920 in The Wolverine 3
3
There be those who say that things and places have souls, and there be those 3
who say they have not; I dare not say, myself, but I will tell of the Street. 3
3
Men of strength and honour fashioned that Street: good valiant men of our blood 3
who had come from the Blessed Isles across the sea. At first it was but a path 3
trodden by bearers of water from the woodland spring to the cluster of houses by 3
the beach. Then, as more men came to the growing cluster of houses and looked 3
about for places to dwell, they built cabins along the north side, cabins of stout 3
oaken logs with masonry on the side toward the forest, for many Indians lurked 3
there with fire-arrows. And in a few years more, men built cabins on the south 3
side of the Street. 3
3
Up and down the Street walked grave men in conical hats, who most of the time 3
carried muskets or fowling pieces. And there were also their bonneted wives and 3
sober children. In the evening these men with their wives and children would sit 3
about gigantic hearths and read and speak. Very simple were the things of which 3
they read and spoke, yet things which gave them courage and goodness and 3
helped them by day to subdue the forest and till the fields. And the children 3
would listen and learn of the laws and deeds of old, and of that dear England 3
which they had never seen or could not remember. 3
3
There was war, and thereafter no more Indians troubled the Street. The men, 3
busy with labour, waxed prosperous and as happy as they knew how to be. And 3
the children grew up comfortable, and more families came from the Mother Land 3
to dwell on the Street. And the children's children, and the newcomers' children, 3
grew up. The town was now a city, and one by one the cabins gave place to 3
houses — simple, beautiful houses of brick and wood, with stone steps and iron 3
railings and fanlights over the doors. No flimsy creations were these houses, for 3
they were made to serve many a generation. Within there were carven mantels 3
and graceful stairs, and sensible, pleasing furniture, china, and silver, brought 3
from the Mother Land. 3
3
So the Street drank in the dreams of a young people and rejoiced as its dwellers 3
became more graceful and happy. Where once had been only strength and 3
honour, taste and learning now abode as well. Books and paintings and music 3
came to the houses, and the young men went to the university which rose above 3
3
3
3
853 3
3
3
3
the plain to the north. In the place of conical hats and small-swords, of lace and 3
snowy periwigs, there were cobblestones over which clattered many a blooded 3
horse and rumbled many a gilded coach; and brick sidewalks with horse blocks 3
and hitching-posts. 3
3
There were in that Street many trees: elms and oaks and maples of dignity; so 3
that in the summer, the scene was all soft verdure and twittering bird-song. And 3
behind the houses were walled rose-gardens with hedged paths and sundials, 3
where at evening the moon and stars would shine bewitchingly while fragrant 3
blossoms glistened with dew. 3
3
So the Street dreamed on, past wars, calamities, and change. Once, most of the 3
young men went away, and some never came back. That was when they furled 3
the old flag and put up a new banner of stripes and stars. But though men talked 3
of great changes, the Street felt them not, for its folk were still the same, speaking 3
of the old familiar things in the old familiar accounts. And the trees still sheltered 3
singing birds, and at evening the moon and stars looked down upon dewy 3
blossoms in the walled rose-gardens. 3
3
In time there were no more swords, three-cornered hats, or periwigs in the Street. 3
How strange seemed the inhabitants with their walking-sticks, tall beavers, and 3
cropped heads! New sounds came from the distance — first strange puffings and 3
shrieks from the river a mile away, and then, many years later, strange puffings 3
and shrieks and rumblings from other directions. The air was not quite so pure 3
as before, but the spirit of the place had not changed. The blood and soul of their 3
ancestors had fashioned the Street. Nor did the spirit change when they tore 3
open the earth to lay down strange pipes, or when they set up tall posts bearing 3
weird wires. There was so much ancient lore in that Street, that the past could 3
not easily be forgotten. 3
3
Then came days of evil, when many who had known the Street of old knew it no 3
more, and many knew it who had not known it before, and went away, for their 3
accents were coarse and strident, and their mien and faces unpleasing. Their 3
thoughts, too, fought with the wise, just spirit of the Street, so that the Street 3
pined silently as its houses fell into decay, and its trees died one by one, and its 3
rose-gardens grew rank with weeds and waste. But it felt a stir of pride one day 3
when again marched forth young men, some of whom never came back. These 3
young men were clad in blue. 3
3
With the years, worse fortune came to the Street. Its trees were all gone now, and 3
its rose-gardens were displaced by the backs of cheap, ugly new buildings on 3
parallel streets. Yet the houses remained, despite the ravages of the years and the 3
storms and worms, for they had been made to serve many a generation. New 3
3
3
3
854 3
3
3
3
kinds of faces appeared in the Street, swarthy, sinister faces with furtive eyes and 3
odd features, whose owners spoke unfamihar words and placed signs in known 3
and unknown characters upon most of the musty houses. Push-carts crowded 3
the gutters. A sordid, undefinable stench settled over the place, and the ancient 3
spirit slept. 3
3
Great excitement once came to the Street. War and revolution were raging across 3
the seas; a dynasty had collapsed, and its degenerate subjects were flocking with 3
dubious intent to the Western Land. Many of these took lodgings in the battered 3
houses that had once known the songs of birds and the scent of roses. Then the 3
Western Land itself awoke and joined the Mother Land in her titanic struggle for 3
civilization. Over the cities once more floated the old flag, companioned by the 3
new flag, and by a plainer, yet glorious tricolour. But not many flags floated over 3
the Street, for therein brooded only fear and hatred and ignorance. Again young 3
men went forth, but not quite as did the young men of those other days. 3
Something was lacking. And the sons of those young men of other days, who did 3
indeed go forth in olive-drab with the true spirit of their ancestors, went from 3
distant places and knew not the Street and its ancient spirit. 3
3
Over the seas there was a great victory, and in triumph most of the young men 3
returned. Those who had lacked something lacked it no longer, yet did fear and 3
hatred and ignorance still brood over the Street; for many had stayed behind, 3
and many strangers had come from distance places to the ancient houses. And 3
the young men who had returned dwelt there no longer. Swarthy and sinister 3
were most of the strangers, yet among them one might find a few faces like those 3
who fashioned the Street and moulded its spirit. Like and yet unlike, for there 3
was in the eyes of all a weird, unhealthy glitter as of greed, ambition, 3
vindictiveness, or misguided zeal. Unrest and treason were abroad amongst an 3
evil few who plotted to strike the Western Land its death blow, that they might 3
mount to power over its ruins, even as assassins had mounted in that unhappy, 3
frozen land from whence most of them had come. And the heart of that plotting 3
was in the Street, whose crumbling houses teemed with alien makers of discord 3
and echoed with the plans and speeches of those who yearned for the appointed 3
day of blood, flame and crime. 3
3
Of the various odd assemblages in the Street, the Law said much but could prove 3
little. With great diligence did men of hidden badges linger and listen about such 3
places as Petrovitch's Bakery, the squalid Rifkin School of Modern Economics, 3
the Circle Social Club, and the Liberty Cafe. There congregated sinister men in 3
great numbers, yet always was their speech guarded or in a foreign tongue. And 3
still the old houses stood, with their forgotten lore of nobler, departed centuries; 3
of sturdy Colonial tenants and dewy rose-gardens in the moonlight. Sometimes a 3
3
3
3
855 3
3
3
3
lone poet or traveler would come to view them, and would try to picture them in 3
their vanished glory; yet of such travelers and poets there were not many. 3
3
The rumour now spread widely that these houses contained the leaders of a vast 3
band of terrorists, who on a designated day were to launch an orgy of slaughter 3
for the extermination of America and of all the fine old traditions which the 3
Street had loved. Handbills and papers fluttered about filthy gutters; handbills 3
and papers printed in many tongues and in many characters, yet all bearing 3
messages of crime and rebellion. In these writings the people were urged to tear 3
down the laws and virtues that our fathers had exalted, to stamp out the soul of 3
the old America— the soul that was bequeathed through a thousand and a half 3
years of Anglo-Saxon freedom, justice, and moderation. It was said that the swart 3
men who dwelt in the Street and congregated in its rotting edifices were the 3
brains of a hideous revolution, that at their word of command many millions of 3
brainless, besotted beasts would stretch forth their noisome talons from the 3
slums of a thousand cities, burning, slaying, and destroying till the land of our 3
fathers should be no more. All this was said and repeated, and many looked 3
forward in dread to the fourth day of July, about which the strange writings 3
hinted much; yet could nothing be found to place the guilt. None could tell just 3
whose arrest might cut off the damnable plotting at its source. Many times came 3
bands of blue-coated police to search the shaky houses, though at last they 3
ceased to come; for they too had grown tired of law and order, and had 3
abandoned all the city to its fate. Then men in olive-drab came, bearing muskets, 3
till it seemed as if in its sad sleep the Street must have some haunting dreams of 3
those other days, when musketbearing men in conical hats walked along it from 3
the woodland spring to the cluster of houses by the beach. Yet could no act be 3
performed to check the impending cataclysm, for the swart, sinister men were 3
old in cunning. 3
3
So the Street slept uneasily on, till one night there gathered in Petrovitch's 3
Bakery, and the Rifkin School of Modern Economics, and the Circle Social Club, 3
and Liberty Cafe, and in other places as well, vast hordes of men whose eyes 3
were big with horrible triumph and expectation. Over hidden wires strange 3
messages traveled, and much was said of still stranger messages yet to travel; but 3
most of this was not guessed till afterward, when the Western Land was safe 3
from the peril. The men in olive-drab could not tell what was happening, or what 3
they ought to do; for the swart, sinister men were skilled in subtlety and 3
concealment. 3
3
And yet the men in olive-drab will always remember that night, and will speak 3
of the Street as they tell of it to their grandchildren; for many of them were sent 3
there toward morning on a mission unlike that which they had expected. It was 3
known that this nest of anarchy was old, and that the houses were tottering from 3
3
3
3
856 3
3
3
3
the ravages of the years and the storms and worms; yet was the happening of 3
that summer night a surprise because of its very queer uniformity. It was, 3
indeed, an exceedingly singular happening, though after all, a simple one. For 3
without warning, in one of the small hours beyond midnight, all the ravages of 3
the years and the storms and the worms came to a tremendous climax; and after 3
the crash there was nothing left standing in the Street save two ancient chimneys 3
and part of a stout brick wall. Nor did anything that had been alive come alive 3
from the ruins. A poet and a traveler, who came with the mighty crowd that 3
sought the scene, tell odd stories. The poet says that all through the hours before 3
dawn he beheld sordid ruins indistinctly in the glare of the arc-lights; that there 3
loomed above the wreckage another picture wherein he could describe 3
moonlight and fair houses and elms and oaks and maples of dignity. And the 3
traveler declares that instead of the place's wonted stench there lingered a 3
delicate fragrance as of roses in full bloom. But are not the dreams of poets and 3
the tales of travelers notoriously false? 3
3
There be those who say that things and places have souls, and there be those 3
who say they have not; I dare not say, myself, but I have told you of the Street. 3

Manuscript Found On The Coast Of Yucatan 3
3
On August20, 1917, I, Karl Heinrich, Graf von Altberg-Ehrenstein, Lieutenant- 3
Commander in the Imperial German Navy and in charge of the submarine U-29, 3
deposit this bottle and record in the Atlantic Ocean at a point to me unknown but 3
probably about N. Latitude 20 degrees, W. Longitude 35 degrees, where my ship 3
lies disabled on the ocean floor. I do so because of my desire to set certain 3
unusual facts before the public; a thing I shall not in all probability survive to 3
accomplish in person, since the circumstances surrounding me are as menacing 3
as they are extraordinary, and involve not only the hopeless crippling of the U- 3
29, but the impairment of my iron German will in a manner most disastrous. 3
3
On the afternoon of June 18, as reported by wireless to the U-61, bound for Kiel, 3
we torpedoed the British freighter Victory, New York to Liverpool, in N. 3
Latitude 45 degrees 16 minutes, W. Longitude 28 degrees 34 minutes; permitting 3
the crew to leave in boats in order to obtain a good cinema view for the 3
admiralty records. The ship sank quite picturesquely, bow first, the stem rising 3
high out of the water whilst the hull shot down perpendicularly to the bottom of 3
the sea. Our camera missed nothing, and I regret that so fine a reel of film should 3
never reach Berlin. After that we sank the lifeboats with our guns and 3
submerged. 3
3
When we rose to the surface about sunset, a seaman's body was found on the 3
deck, hands gripping the railing in curious fashion. The poor fellow was young, 3
rather dark, and very handsome; probably an Italian or Greek, and undoubtedly 3
of the Victory's crew. He had evidently sought refuge on the very ship which 3
had been forced to destroy his own - one more victim of the unjust war of 3
aggression which the English pig-dogs are waging upon the Fatherland. Our 3
men searched him for souvenirs, and found in his coat pocket a very odd bit of 3
ivory carved to represent a youth's head crowned with laurel. My fellow-officer. 3
Lieutenant Kienze, believed that the thing was of great age and artistic value, so 3
took it from the men for himself. How it had ever come into the possession of a 3
common sailor neither he nor I could imagine. 3
3
As the dead man was thrown overboard there occurred two incidents which 3
created much disturbance amongst the crew. The fellow's eyes had been closed; 3
3
3
3
858 3
3
3
3
but in the dragging of his body to the rail they were jarred open, and many 3
seemed to entertain a queer delusion that they gazed steadily and mockingly at 3
Schmidt and Zimmer, who were bent over the corpse. The Boatswain Muller, an 3
elderly man who would have known better had he not been a superstitious 3
Alsatian swine, became so excited by this impression that he watched the body 3
in the water; and swore that after it sank a little it drew its limbs into a 3
swiinming position and sped away to the south under the waves. Kienze and I 3
did not like these displays of peasant ignorance, and severely reprimanded the 3
men, particularly Muller. 3
3
The next day a very troublesome situation was created by the indisposition of 3
some of the crew. They were evidently suffering from the nervous strain of our 3
long voyage, and had had bad dreams. Several seemed quite dazed and stupid; 3
and after satisfying myself that they were not feigning their weakness, I excused 3
them from their duties. The sea was rather rough, so we descended to a depth 3
where the waves were less troublesome. Here we were comparatively calm, 3
despite a somewhat puzzling southward current which we could not identify 3
from our oceanographic charts. The moans of the sick men were decidedly 3
annoying; but since they did not appear to demoralize the rest of the crew, we 3
did not resort to extreme measures. It was our plan to remain where we were 3
and intercept the liner Dacia, mentioned in information from agents in New 3
York. 3
3
In the early evening we rose to the surface, and found the sea less heavy. The 3
smoke of a battleship was on the northern horizon, but our distance and ability 3
to submerge made us safe. What worried us more was the talk of Boatswain 3
Muller, which grew wilder as night came on. He was in a detestably childish 3
state, and babbled of some illusion of dead bodies drifting past the undersea 3
portholes; bodies which looked at him intensely, and which he recognized in 3
spite of bloating as having seen dying during some of our victorious German 3
exploits. And he said that the young man we had found and tossed overboard 3
was their leader. This was very gruesome and abnormal, so we confined Muller 3
in irons and had him soundly whipped. The men were not pleased at his 3
punishment, but discipline was necessary. We also denied the request of a 3
delegation headed by Seaman Zimmer, that the curious carved ivory head be 3
cast into the sea. 3
3
On June 20, Seaman Bohin and Schmidt, who had been ill the day before, became 3
violently insane. I regretted that no physician was included in our complement 3
of officers, since German lives are precious; but the constant ravings of the two 3
concerning a terrible curse were most subversive of discipline, so drastic steps 3
were taken. The crew accepted the event in a sullen fashion, but it seemed to 3
3
3
3
859 3
3
3
3
quiet Muller; who thereafter gave us no trouble. In the evening we released him, 3
and he went about his duties silently. 3
3
In the week that followed we were all very nervous, watching for the Dacia. The 3
tension was aggravated by the disappearance of Muller and Zimmer, who 3
undoubtedly committed suicide as a result of the fears which had seemed to 3
harass them, though they were not observed in the act of jumping overboard. I 3
was rather glad to be rid of Muller, for even his silence had unfavorably affected 3
the crew. Everyone seemed inclined to be silent now, as though holding a secret 3
fear. Many were ill, but none made a disturbance. Lieutenant Kienze chafed 3
under the strain, and was annoyed by the merest trifle - such as the school of 3
dolphins which gathered about the U-29 in increasing numbers, and the growing 3
intensity of that southward current which was not on our chart. 3
3
It at length became apparent that we had missed the Dacia altogether. Such 3
failures are not uncommon, and we were more pleased than disappointed, since 3
our return to Wilhelmshaven was now in order. At noon June 28 we turned 3
northeastward, and despite some rather comical entanglements with the unusual 3
masses of dolphins, were soon under way. 3
3
The explosion in the engine room at 2 A.M. was wholly a surprise. No defect in 3
the machinery or carelessness in the men had been noticed, yet without warning 3
the ship was racked from end to end with a colossal shock. Lieutenant Kienze 3
hurried to the engine room, finding the fuel-tank and most of the mechanism 3
shattered, and Engineers Raabe and Schneider instantly killed. Our situation had 3
suddenly become grave indeed; for though the chemical air regenerators were 3
intact, and though we could use the devices for raising and submerging the ship 3
and opening the hatches as long as compressed air and storage batteries might 3
hold out, we were powerless to propel or guide the submarine. To seek rescue in 3
the life-boats would be to deliver ourselves into the hands of enemies 3
unreasonably embittered against our great German nation, and our wireless had 3
failed ever since the Victory affair to put us in touch with a fellow U-boat of the 3
Imperial Navy. 3
3
From the hour of the accident till July 2 we drifted constantly to the south, almost 3
without plans and encountering no vessel. Dolphins still encircled the U-29, a 3
somewhat remarkable circumstance considering the distance we had covered. 3
On the morning of July 2 we sighted a warship flying American colors, and the 3
men became very restless in their desire to surrender. Finally Lieutenant Menze 3
had to shoot a seaman named Traube, who urged this un-German act with 3
especial violence. This quieted the crew for the time, and we submerged unseen. 3
3
3
3
860 3
3
3
3
The next afternoon a dense flock of sea-birds appeared from the south, and the 3
ocean began to heave ominously. Closing our hatches, we awaited developments 3
until we realized that we must either submerge or be swamped in the mounting 3
waves. Our air pressure and electricity were diminishing, and we wished to 3
avoid all unnecessary use of our slender mechanical resources; but in this case 3
there was no choice. We did not descend far, and when after several hours the 3
sea was calmer, we decided to return to the surface. Here, however, a new 3
trouble developed; for the ship failed to respond to our direction in spite of all 3
that the mechanics could do. As the men grew more frightened at this undersea 3
imprisonment, some of them began to mutter again about Lieutenant Kienze's 3
ivory image, but the sight of an automatic pistol calmed them. We kept the poor 3
devils as busy as we could, tinkering at the machinery even when we knew it 3
was useless. 3
3
Kienze and I usually slept at different times; and it was during my sleep, about 5 3
A.M., July 4, that the general mutiny broke loose. The six remaining pigs of 3
seamen, suspecting that we were lost, had suddenly burst into a mad fury at our 3
refusal to surrender to the Yankee battleship two days before, and were in a 3
delirium of cursing and destruction. They roared like the animals they were, and 3
broke instruments and furniture indiscriminately; screaming about such 3
nonsense as the curse of the ivory image and the dark dead youth who looked at 3
them and swam away. Lieutenant Kienze seemed paralyzed and inefficient, as 3
one might expect of a soft, womanish Rhinelander. I shot all six men, for it was 3
necessary, and made sure that none remained alive. 3
3
We expelled the bodies through the double hatches and were alone in the U-29. 3
Kienze seemed very nervous, and drank heavily. It was decided that we remain 3
alive as long as possible, using the large stock of provisions and chemical supply 3
of oxygen, none of which had suffered from the crazy antics of those swine- 3
hound seamen. Our compasses, depth gauges, and other delicate instruments 3
were ruined; so that henceforth our only reckoning would be guess work, based 3
on our watches, the calendar, and our apparent drift as judged by any objects we 3
might spy through the portholes or from the conning tower. Fortunately we had 3
storage batteries still capable of long use, both for interior lighting and for the 3
searchlight. We often cast a beam around the ship, but saw only dolphins, 3
swimming parallel to our own drifting course. I was scientifically interested in 3
those dolphins; for though the ordinary Delphinus delphis is a cetacean 3
mammal, unable to subsist without air, I watched one of the swimmers closely 3
for two hours, and did not see him alter his submerged condition. 3
3
With the passage of time Kienze and I decided that we were still drifting south, 3
meanwhile sinking deeper and deeper. We noted the marine fauna and flora, and 3
read much on the subject in the books I had carried with.me for spare moments. I 3
3
3
3
861 3
3
3
3
could not help observing, however, the inferior scientific knowledge of my 3
companion. His mind was not Prussian, but given to imaginings and 3
speculations which have no value. The fact of our coming death affected him 3
curiously, and he would frequently pray in remorse over the men, women, and 3
children we had sent to the bottom; forgetting that all things are noble which 3
serve the German state. After a time he became noticeably unbalanced, gazing 3
for hours at his ivory image and weaving fanciful stories of the lost and forgotten 3
things under the sea. Sometimes, as a psychological experiment, I would lead 3
him on in the wanderings, and listen to his endless poetical quotations and tales 3
of sunken ships. I was very sorry for him, for I dislike to see a German suffer; but 3
he was not a good man to die with. For myself I was proud, knowing how the 3
Fatherland would revere my memory and how my sons would be taught to be 3
men like me. 3
3
On August 9, we espied the ocean floor, and sent a powerful beam from the 3
searchlight over it. It was a vast undulating plain, mostly covered with seaweed, 3
and strewn with the shells of small moflusks. Here and there were slimy objects 3
of puzzling contour, draped with weeds and encrusted with barnacles, which 3
Kienze declared must be ancient ships lying in their graves. He was puzzled by 3
one thing, a peak of solid matter, protruding above the oceanbed nearly four feet 3
at its apex; about two feet thick, with flat sides and smooth upper surfaces which 3
met at a very obtuse angle. I called the peak a bit of outcropping rock, but Kienze 3
thought he saw carvings on it. After a while he began to shudder, and turned 3
away from the scene, as if frightened; yet could give no explanation save that he 3
was overcome with the vastness, darkness, remoteness, antiquity, and mystery of 3
the oceanic abysses. His mind was tired, but I am always a German, and was 3
quick to notice two things: that the U-29 was standing the deep-sea pressure 3
splendidly, and that the peculiar dolphins were still about us, even at a depth 3
where the existence of high organisms is considered impossible by most 3
naturalists. That I had previously overestimated our depth, I was sure; but none 3
the less we must still have been deep enough to make these phenomena 3
remarkable. Our southward speed, as gauged by the ocean floor, was about as I 3
had estimated from the organisms passed at higher levels. 3
3
It was at 3:15 PM., August 12, that poor Kienze went wholly mad. He had been 3
in the conning tower using the searchlight when I saw him bound into the library 3
compartment where I sat reading, and his face at once betrayed him. I will repeat 3
here what he said, underlining the words he emphasized: "He is calling! He is 3
calling! I hear him! We must go!" As he spoke he took his ivory image from the 3
table, pocketed it, and seized my arm in an effort to drag me up the 3
companionway to the deck. In a moment I understood that he meant to open the 3
hatch and plunge with me into the water outside, a vagary of suicidal and 3
homicidal mania for which I was scarcely prepared. As I hung back and 3
3
3
3
862 3
3
3
3
attempted to soothe him he grew more violent, saying: "Come now - do not wait 3
until later; it is better to repent and be forgiven than to defy and be condemned." 3
Then I tried the opposite of the soothing plan, and told him he was mad - 3
pitifully demented. But he was unmoved, and cried: "If I am mad, it is mercy. 3
May the gods pity the man who in his callousness can remam sane to the hideous 3
end! Come and be mad whilst he still calls with mercy!" 3
3
This outburst seemed to relieve a pressure in his brain; for as he finished he grew 3
much milder, asking me to let him depart alone if I would not accompany him. 3
My course at once became clear. He was a German, but only a Rhinelander and a 3
commoner; and he was now a potentially dangerous madman. By complying 3
with his suicidal request I could immediately free myself from one who was no 3
longer a companion but a menace. I asked him to give me the ivory image before 3
he went, but this request brought from him such uncanny laughter that I did not 3
repeat it. Then I asked him if he wished to leave any keepsake or lock of hair for 3
his family in Germany in case I should be rescued, but again he gave me that 3
strange laugh. So as he climbed the ladder I went to the levers and, allowing 3
proper time-intervals, operated the machinery which sent him to his death. After 3
I saw that he was no longer in the boat I threw the searchlight around the water 3
in an effort to obtain a last glimpse of him since I wished to ascertain whether the 3
water-pressure would flatten him as it theoretically should, or whether the body 3
would be unaffected, like those extraordinary dolphins. I did not, however, 3
succeed in finding my late companion, for the dolphins were massed thickly and 3
obscuringly about the conning tower. 3
3
That evening I regretted that I had not taken the ivory image surreptitiously 3
from poor Kienze's pocket as he left, for the memory of it fascinated me. I could 3
not forget the youthful, beautiful head with its leafy crown, though I am not by 3
nature an artist. I was also sorry that I had no one with whom to converse. 3
Kienze, though not my mental equal, was much better than no one. I did not 3
sleep well that night, and wondered exactly when the end would come. Surely, I 3
had little enough chance of rescue. 3
3
The next day I ascended to the conning tower and commenced the customary 3
searchlight explorations. Northward the view was much the same as it had been 3
all the four days since we had sighted the bottom, but I perceived that the 3
drifting of the U-29 was less rapid. As I swung the beam around to the south, I 3
noticed that the ocean floor ahead fell away in a marked declivity, and bore 3
curiously regular blocks of stone in certain places, disposed as if in accordance 3
with definite patterns. The boat did not at once descend to match the greater 3
ocean depth, so I was soon forced to adjust the searchlight to cast a sharply 3
downward beam. Owing to the abruptness of the change a wire was 3
3
3
3
863 3
3
3
3
disconnected, which necessitated a delay of many minutes for repairs; but at 3
length the light streamed on again, flooding the marine valley below me. 3
3
I am not given to emotion of any kind, but my amazement was very great when I 3
saw what lay revealed in that electrical glow. And yet as one reared in the best 3
Kultur of Prussia, I should not have been amazed, for geology and tradition alike 3
tell us of great transpositions in oceanic and continental areas. What I saw was an 3
extended and elaborate array of ruined edifices; all of magnificent though 3
unclassified architecture, and in various stages of preservation. Most appeared to 3
be of marble, gleaming whitely in the rays of the searchlight, and the general 3
plan was of a large city at the bottom of a narrow valley, with numerous isolated 3
temples and villas on the steep slopes above. Roofs were fallen and columns 3
were broken, but there still remained an air of immemorially ancient splendor 3
which nothing could efface. 3
3
Confronted at last with the Atlantis I had formerly deemed largely a myth, I was 3
the most eager of explorers. At the bottom of that valley a river once had flowed; 3
for as I examined the scene more closely I beheld the remains of stone and 3
marble bridges and sea-walls, and terraces and embankments once verdant and 3
beautiful. In my enthusiasm I became nearly as idiotic and sentimental as poor 3
Kienze, and was very tardy in noticing that the southward current had ceased at 3
last, allowing the U-29 to settle slowly down upon the sunken city as an airplane 3
settles upon a town of the upper earth. I was slow, to, in realizing that the school 3
of unusual dolphins had vanished. 3
3
In about two hours the boat rested in a paved plaza close to the rocky wall of the 3
valley. On one side I could view the entire city as it sloped from the plaza down 3
to the old river-bank; on the other side, in startling proximity, I was confronted 3
by the richly ornate and perfectly preserved facade of a great building, evidently 3
a temple, hollowed from the solid rock. Of the original workmanship of this 3
titanic thing I can only make conjectures. The facade, of immense magnitude, 3
apparently covers a continuous hollow recess; for its windows are many and 3
widely distributed. In the center yawns a great open door, reached by an 3
impressive flight of steps, and surrounded by exquisite carvings like the figures 3
of Bacchanals in relief. Foremost of all are the great columns and frieze, both 3
decorated with sculptures of inexpressible beauty; obviously portraying 3
idealized pastoral scenes and processions of priests and priestesses bearing 3
strange ceremonial devices in adoration of a radiant god. The art is of the most 3
phenomenal perfection, largely Hellenic in idea, yet strangely individual. It 3
imparts an impression of terrible antiquity, as though it were the remotest rather 3
than the immediate ancestor of Greek art. Nor can I doubt that every detail of 3
this massive product was fashioned from the virgin hillside rock of our planet. It 3
is palpably a part of the valley wall, though how the vast interior was ever 3
3
3
3
864 3
3
3
3
excavated I cannot imagine. Perhaps a cavern or series of caverns furnished the 3
nucleus. Neither age nor submersion has corroded the pristine grandeur of this 3
awful fane - for fane indeed it must be - and today after thousands of years it 3
rests untarnished and inviolate in the endless night and silence of an ocean- 3
chasm. 3
3
I cannot reckon the number of hours I spent in gazing at the sunken city with its 3
buildings, arches, statues, and bridges, and the colossal temple with its beauty 3
and mystery. Though I knew that death was near, my curiosity was consuming; 3
and I threw the searchlight beam about in eager quest. The shaft of light 3
permitted me to learn many details, but refused to show anything within the 3
gaping door of the rock-hewn temple; and after a time I turned off the current, 3
conscious of the need of conserving power. The rays were now perceptibly 3
dimmer than they had been during the weeks of drifting. And as if sharpened by 3
the coming deprivation of light, my desire to explore the watery secrets grew. I, a 3
German, should be the first to tread those eon-forgotten ways! 3
3
I produced and examined a deep-sea diving suit of jointed metal, and 3
experimented with the portable light and air regenerator. Though I should have 3
trouble in managing the double hatches alone, I believed I could overcome all 3
obstacles with my scientific skill and actually walk about the dead city in person. 3
3
On August 16 I effected an exit from the U-29, and laboriously made my way 3
through the ruined and mud-choked streets to the ancient river. I found no 3
skeletons or other human remains, but gleaned a wealth of archeological lore 3
from sculptures and coins. Of this I cannot now speak save to utter my awe at a 3
culture in the full noon of glory when cave-dwellers roamed Europe and the Nile 3
flowed unwatched to the sea. Others, guided by this manuscript if it shall ever be 3
found, must unfold the mysteries at which I can only hint. I returned to the boat 3
as my electric batteries grew feeble, resolved to explore the rock temple on the 3
following day. 3
3
On the 17th, as my impulse to search out the mystery of the temple waxed still 3
more insistent, a great disappointment befell me; for I found that the materials 3
needed to replenish the portable light had perished in the mutiny of those pigs in 3
July. My rage was unbounded, yet my German sense forbade me to venture 3
unprepared into an utterly black interior which might prove the lair of some 3
indescribable marine monster or a labyrinth of passages from whose windings I 3
could never extricate myself. All I could do was to turn on the waning 3
searchlight of the U-29, and with its aid walk up the temple steps and study the 3
exterior carvings. The shaft of light entered the door at an upward angle, and I 3
peered in to see if I could glimpse anything, but all in vain. Not even the roof 3
was visible; and though I took a step or two inside after testing the floor with a 3
3
3
3
865 3
3
3
3
staff, I dared not go farther. Moreover, for the first time in my Hfe I experienced 3
the emotion of dread. I began to reahze how some of poor Kienze's moods had 3
arisen, for as the temple drew me more and more, I feared its aqueous abysses 3
with a bhnd and mounting terror. Returning to the submarine, I turned off the 3
hghts and sat thinking in the dark. Electricity must now be saved for 3
emergencies. 3
3
Saturday the 18th I spent in total darkness, tormented by thoughts and memories 3
that threatened to overcome my German will. Kienze bad gone mad and 3
perished before reaching this sinster remnant of a past unwholesomely remote, 3
and had advised me to go with him. Was, indeed. Fate preserving my reason 3
only to draw me irresistibly to an end more horrible and unthinkable than any 3
man has dreamed of? Clearly, my nerves were sorely taxed, and I must cast off 3
these impressions of weaker men. 3
3
I could not sleep Saturday night, and turned on the lights regardless of the 3
future. It was annoying that the electricity should not last out the air and 3
provisions. I revived my thoughts of euthanasia, and examined my automatic 3
pistol. Toward morning I must have dropped asleep with the lights on, for I 3
awoke in darkness yesterday afternoon to find the batteries dead. I struck several 3
matches in succession, and desperately regretted the improvidence which had 3
caused us long ago to use up the few candles we carried. 3
3
After the fading of the last match I dared to waste, I sat very quietly without a 3
light. As I considered the inevitable end my mind ran over preceding events, and 3
developed a hitherto dormant impression which would have caused a weaker 3
and more superstitious man to shudder. The head of the radiant god in the 3
sculptures on the rock temple is the same as that carven bit of ivory which the 3
dead sailor brought from the sea and which poor Kienze carried back into the 3
sea. 3
3
I was a little dazed by this coincidence, but did not become terrified. It is only the 3
inferior thinker who hastens to explain the singular and the complex by the 3
primitive shortcut of supernaturalism. The coincidence was strange, but I was 3
too sound a reasoner to connect circumstances which admit of no logical 3
connection, or to associate in any uncanny fashion the disastrous events which 3
had led from the Victory affair to my present plight. Feeling the need of more 3
rest, I took a sedative and secured some more sleep. My nervous condition was 3
reflected in my dreams, for I seemed to hear the cries of drowning persons, and 3
to see dead faces pressing against the portholes of the boat. And among the dead 3
faces was the living, mocking face of the youth with the ivory image. 3
3
3
3
866 3
3
3
3
I must be careful how I record my awakening today, for I am unstrung, and 3
much hallucination is necessarily mixed with fact. Psychologically my case is 3
most interesting, and I regret that it cannot be observed scientifically by a 3
competent German authority. Upon opening my eyes my first sensation was an 3
overmastering desire to visit the rock temple; a desire which grew every instant, 3
yet which I automatically sought to resist through some emotion of fear which 3
operated in the reverse direction. Next there came to me the impression of light 3
amidst the darkness of dead batteries, and I seemed to see a sort of 3
phosphorescent glow in the water through the porthole which opened toward 3
the temple. This aroused my curiosity, for I knew of no deep-sea organism 3
capable of emitting such luminosity. 3
3
But before I could investigate there came a third impression which because of its 3
irrationality caused me to doubt the objectivity of anything my senses might 3
record. It was an aural delusion; a sensation of rhythmic, melodic sound as of 3
some wild yet beautiful chant or choral hymn, coming from the outside through 3
the absolutely sound-proof hull of the U-29. Convinced of my psychological and 3
nervous abnormality, I lighted some matches and poured a stiff dose of sodium 3
bromide solution, which seemed to calm me to the extent of dispelling the 3
illusion of sound. But the phosphorescence remained, and I had difficulty in 3
repressing a childish impulse to go to the porthole and seek its source. It was 3
horribly realistic, and I could soon distinguish by its aid the familiar objects 3
around me, as well as the empty sodium bromide glass of which I had had no 3
former visual impression in its present location. This last circumstance made me 3
ponder, and I crossed the room and touched the glass. It was indeed in the place 3
where I had seemed to see it. Now I knew that the light was either real or part of 3
an hallucination so fixed and consistent that I could not hope to dispel it, so 3
abandoning all resistance I ascended to the conning tower to look for the 3
luminous agency. Might it not actually be another U-boat, offering possibilities of 3
rescue? 3
3
It is well that the reader accept nothing which follows as objective truth, for since 3
the events transcend natural law, they are necessity the subjective and unreal 3
creations of my overtaxed mind. When I attained the conning tower I found the 3
sea in general far less luminous than I had expected. There was no animal or 3
vegetable phosphorescence about, and the city that sloped down to the river was 3
invisible in blackness. What I did see was not spectacular, not grotesque or 3
terrifying, yet it removed my last vestige of trust in my consciousness. For the 3
door and windows of the undersea temple hewn from the rocky hill were vividly 3
aglow with a flickering radiance, as from a mighty altar-flame far within. 3
3
Later incidents are chaotic. As I stared at the uncannily lighted door and 3
windows, I became subject to the most extravagant visions - visions so 3
3
3
3
867 3
3
3
3
extravagant that I cannot even relate them. I fancied that I discerned objects in 3
the temple; objects both stationary and moving; and seemed to hear again the 3
unreal chant that had floated to me when first I awaked. And over all rose 3
thoughts and fears which centered in the youth from the sea and the ivory image 3
whose carving was duplicated on the frieze and columns of the temple before 3
me. I thought of poor Kienze, and wondered where his body rested with the 3
image he had carried back into the sea. He had warned me of something, and I 3
had not heeded - but he was a soft-headed Rhinelander who went mad at 3
troubles a Prussian could bear with ease. 3
3
The rest is very simple. My impulse to visit and enter the temple has now 3
become an inexplicable and imperious command which ultimately cannot be 3
denied. My own German will no longer controls my acts, and volition is 3
henceforward possible only in minor matters. Such madness it was which drove 3
Kienze to his death, bare-headed and unprotected in the ocean; but I am a 3
Prussian and a man of sense, and will use to the last what little will I have. When 3
first I saw that I must go, I prepared my diving suit, helmet, and air regenerator 3
for instant donning, and immediately commenced to write this hurried chronicle 3
in the hope that it may some day reach the world. I shall seal the manuscript in a 3
bottle and entrust it to the sea as I leave the U-29 for ever. 3
3
I have no fear, not even from the prophecies of the madman Kienze. What I have 3
seen cannot be true, and I know that this madness of my own will at most lead 3
only to suffocation when my air is gone. The light in the temple is a sheer 3
delusion, and I shall die calmly like a German, in the black and forgotten depths. 3
This demoniac laughter which I hear as I write comes only from my own 3
weakening brain. So I will carefully don my suit and walk boldly up the steps 3
into the primal shrine, that silent secret of unfathomed waters and uncounted 3
years. 3

The Terrible Old Man 3
3
Written 28 Jan 1920 3
3
Published July 1921 in The Tryout, Vol. 7, No. 4, p. 10-14. 3
3
It was the design of Angelo Ricci and Joe Czanek and Manuel Silva to call on the 3
Terrible Old Man. This old man dwells all alone in a very ancient house on Water 3
Street near the sea, and is reputed to be both exceedingly rich and exceedingly 3
feeble; which forms a situation very attractive to men of the profession of Messrs. 3
Ricci, Czanek, and Silva, for that profession was nothing less dignified than 3
robbery. 3
3
The inhabitants of Kingsport say and think many things about the Terrible Old 3
Man which generally keep him safe from the attention of gentlemen like Mr. 3
Ricci and his colleagues, despite the almost certain fact that he hides a fortune of 3
indefinite magnitude somewhere about his musty and venerable abode. He is, in 3
truth, a very strange person, believed to have been a captain of East India clipper 3
ships in his day; so old that no one can remember when he was young, and so 3
taciturn that few know his real name. Among the gnarled trees in the front yard 3
of his aged and neglected place he maintains a strange collection of large stones, 3
oddly grouped and painted so that they resemble the idols in some obscure 3
Eastern temple. This collection frightens away most of the small boys who love 3
to taunt the Terrible Old Man about his long white hair and beard, or to break 3
the small-paned windows of his dwelling with wicked missiles; but there are 3
other things which frighten the older and more curious folk who sometimes steal 3
up to the house to peer in through the dusty panes. These folk say that on a table 3
in a bare room on the ground floor are many peculiar bottles, in each a small 3
piece of lead suspended pendulum-wise from a string. And they say that the 3
Terrible Old Man talks to these bottles, addressing them by such names as Jack, 3
Scar-Face, Long Tom, Spanish Joe, Peters, and Mate Ellis, and that whenever he 3
speaks to a bottle the little lead pendulum within makes certain definite 3
vibrations as if in answer. 3
3
Those who have watched the tall, lean. Terrible Old Man in these peculiar 3
conversations, do not watch him again. But Angelo Ricci and Joe Czanek and 3
Manuel Silva were not of Kingsport blood; they were of that new and 3
heterogeneous alien stock which lies outside the charmed circle of New England 3
life and traditions, and they saw in the Terrible Old Man merely a tottering, 3
almost helpless grey-beard, who could not walk without the aid of his knotted 3
cane, and whose thin, weak hands shook pitifully. They were really quite sorry 3
in their way for the lonely, unpopular old fellow, whom everybody shunned. 3
3
3
3
869 3
3
3
3
and at whom all the dogs barked singularly. But business is business, and to a 3
robber whose soul is in his profession, there is a lure and a challenge about a 3
very old and very feeble man who has no account at the bank, and who pays for 3
his few necessities at the village store with Spanish gold and silver minted two 3
centuries ago. 3
3
Messrs. Ricci, Czanek, and Silva selected the night of April 11th for their call. Mr. 3
Ricci and Mr. Silva were to interview the poor old gentleman, whilst Mr. Czanek 3
waited for them and their presumable metallic burden with a covered motor-car 3
in Ship Street, by the gate in the tall rear wall of their host's grounds. Desire to 3
avoid needless explanations in case of unexpected police intrusions prompted 3
these plans for a quiet and unostentatious departure. 3
3
As prearranged, the three adventurers started out separately in order to prevent 3
any evil-minded suspicions afterward. Messrs. Ricci and Silva met in Water 3
Street by the old man's front gate, and although they did not like the way the 3
moon shone down upon the painted stones through the budding branches of the 3
gnarled trees, they had more important things to think about than mere idle 3
superstition. They feared it might be unpleasant work making the Terrible Old 3
Man loquacious concerning his hoarded gold and silver, for aged sea-captains 3
are notably stubborn and perverse. Still, he was very old and very feeble, and 3
there were two visitors. Messrs. Ricci and Silva were experienced in the art of 3
making unwilling persons voluble, and the screams of a weak and exceptionally 3
venerable man can be easily muffled. So they moved up to the one lighted 3
window and heard the Terrible Old Man talking childishly to his bottles with 3
pendulums. Then they donned masks and knocked politely at the weather- 3
stained oaken door. 3
3
Waiting seemed very long to Mr. Czanek as he fidgeted restlessly in the covered 3
motor-car by the Terrible Old Man's back gate in Ship Street. He was more than 3
ordinarily tender-hearted, and he did not like the hideous screams he had heard 3
in the ancient house just after the hour appointed for the deed. Had he not told 3
his colleagues to be as gentle as possible with the pathetic old sea-captain? Very 3
nervously he watched that narrow oaken gate in the high and ivy-clad stone 3
wall. Frequently he consulted his watch, and wondered at the delay. Had the old 3
man died before revealing where his treasure was hidden, and had a thorough 3
search become necessary? Mr. Czanek did not like to wait so long in the dark in 3
such a place. Then he sensed a soft tread or tapping on the walk inside the gate, 3
heard a gentle fumbling at the rusty latch, and saw the narrow, heavy door 3
swing inward. And in the pallid glow of the single dim street-lamp he strained 3
his eyes to see what his colleagues had brought out of that sinister house which 3
loomed so close behind. But when he looked, he did not see what he had 3
expected; for his colleagues were not there at all, but only the Terrible Old Man 3
3
3
3
870 3
3
3
3
leaning quietly on his knotted cane and smiling hideously. Mr. Czanek had never 3
before noticed the colour of that man's eyes; now he saw that they were yellow. 3
3
Little things make considerable excitement in little towns, which is the reason 3
that Kingsport people talked all that spring and summer about the three 3
unidentifiable bodies, horribly slashed as with many cutlasses, and horribly 3
mangled as by the tread of many cruel boot-heels, which the tide washed in. And 3
some people even spoke of things as trivial as the deserted motor-car found in 3
Ship Street, or certain especially inhuman cries, probably of a stray animal or 3
migratory bird, heard in the night by wakeful citizens. But in this idle village 3
gossip the Terrible Old Man took no interest at all. He was by nature reserved, 3
and when one is aged and feeble, one's reserve is doubly strong. Besides, so 3
ancient a sea- captain must have witnessed scores of things much more stirring 3
in the far-off days of his unremembered youth. 3

The Thing on the Doorstep 3

3
Published January 1937 in Weird Tales, Vol. 29, No. 1, p. 52-70. 3
3
I 3
3
It is true that I have sent six bullets through the head of my best friend, and yet I 3
hope to show by this statement that I am not his murderer. At first I shall be 3
called a madman - madder than the man I shot in his cell at the Arkham 3
Sanitarium. Later some of my readers will weigh each statement, correlate it with 3
the known facts, and ask themselves how I could have believed otherwise than I 3
did after facing the evidence of that horror - that thing on the doorstep. 3
3
Until then I also saw nothing but madness in the wild tales I have acted on. Even 3
now I ask myself whether I was misled - or whether I am not mad after all. I do 3
not know - but others have strange things to tell of Edward and Asenath Derby, 3
and even the stolid police are at their wits' ends to account for that last terrible 3
visit. They have tried weakly to concoct a theory of a ghastly jest or warning by 3
discharged servants, yet they know in their hearts that the truth is something 3
infinitely more terrible and incredible. 3
3
So I say that I have not murdered Edward Derby. Rather have I avenged him, 3
and in so doing purged the earth of a horror whose survival might have loosed 3
untold terrors on all mankind. There are black zones of shadow close to our daily 3
paths, and now and then some evil soul breaks a passage through. When that 3
happens, the man who knows must strike before reckoning the consequences. 3
3
I have known Edward Pickman Derby all his life. Eight years my junior, he was 3
so precocious that we had much in common from the time he was eight and I 3
was sixteen. He was the most phenomenal child scholar I have ever known, and 3
at seven was writing verse of a sombre, fantastic, almost morbid cast which 3
astonished the tutors surrounding him. Perhaps his private education and 3
coddled seclusion had something to do with his premature flowering. An only 3
child, he had organic weaknesses which startled his doting parents and caused 3
them to keep him closely chained to their side. He was never allowed out 3
without his nurse, and seldom had a chance to play unconstrainedly with other 3
children. All this doubtless fostered a strange secretive life in the boy, with 3
imagination as his one avenue of freedom. 3
3
At any rate, his juvenile learning was prodigious and bizarre; and his facile 3
writings such as to captivate me despite my greater age. About that time I had 3
3
3
3
872 3
3
3
3
leanings toward art of a somewhat grotesque cast, and I found in this younger 3
child a rare kindred spirit. What lay behind our joint love of shadows and 3
marvels was, no doubt, the ancient, mouldering, and subtly fearsome town in 3
which we live - witch-cursed, legend-haunted Arkham, whose huddled, sagging 3
gambrel roofs and crumbling Georgian balustrades brood out the centuries 3
beside the darkly muttering Miskatonic. 3
3
As time went by I turned to architecture and gave up my design of illustrating a 3
book of Edward's demoniac poems, yet our comradeship suffered no lessening. 3
Young Derby's odd genius developed remarkably, and in his eighteenth year his 3
collected nightmare-lyrics made a real sensation when issued under the title 3
Azathoth and Other Horrors. He was a close correspondent of the notorious 3
Baudelairean poet Justin Geoffrey, who wrote The People of the Monolith and 3
died screaming in a madhouse in 1926 after a visit to a sinister, ill-regarded 3
village in Hungary. 3
3
In self-reliance and practical affairs, however, Derby was greatly retarded 3
because of his coddled existence. His health had improved, but his habits of 3
childish dependence were fostered by over-careful parents, so that he never 3
travelled alone, made independent decisions, or assumed responsibilities. It was 3
early seen that he would not be equal to a struggle in the business or professional 3
arena, but the family fortune was so ample that this formed no tragedy. As he 3
grew to years of manhood he retained a deceptive aspect of boyishness. Blond 3
and blue-eyed, he had the fresh complexion of a child; and his attempt to raise a 3
moustache were discernible only with difficulty. His voice was soft and light, 3
and his unexercised life gave him a juvenile chubbiness rather than the 3
paunchiness of premature middle age. He was of good height, and his handsome 3
face would have made him a notable gallant had not his shyness held him to 3
seclusion and bookishness. 3
3
Derby's parents took him abroad every summer, and he was quick to seize on 3
the surface aspects of European thought and expression. His Poe-like talents 3
turned more and more toward the decadent, and other artistic sensitiveness and 3
yearnings were half-aroused in him. We had great discussions in those days. I 3
had been through Harvard, had studied in a Boston architect's office, had 3
married, and had finally returned to Arkham to practise my profession - settling 3
in the family homestead in Saltonstall Street since my father had moved to 3
Florida for his health. Edward used to call almost every evening, till I came to 3
regard him as one of the household. He had a characteristic way of ringing the 3
doorbell or sounding the knocker that grew to be a veritable code signal, so that 3
after dinner I always listened for the familiar three brisk strokes followed by two 3
more after a pause. Less frequently I would visit at his house and note with envy 3
the obscure volumes in his constantly growing library. 3

3
Derby went through Miskatonic University in Arkahm since his parents would 3
not let him board away from them. He entered at sixteen and completed his 3
course in three years, majoring in English and French literature and receiving 3
high marks in everything but mathematics and the sciences. He mingled very 3
little with the other students, though looking enviously at the "daring" or 3
"Bohemian" set - whose superficially "smart" language and meaningless ironic 3
pose he aped, and whose dubious conduct he wished he dared adopt. 3
3
What he did do was to become an almost fanatical devotee of subterranean 3
magical lore, for which Miskatonic's library was and is famous. Always a dweller 3
on the surface of phantasy and strangeness, he now delved deep into the actual 3
runes and riddles left by a fabulous past for the guidance or puzzlement of 3
posterity. He read things like the frightful Book of Eibon, the Unaussprechlichen 3
Kulten of von Junzt, and the forbidden Necronomicon of the mad Arab Abdul 3
Alhazred, though he did not tell his parents he had seen them. Edward was 3
twenty when my son and only child was born, and seemed pleased when I 3
named the newcomer Edward Derby Upton after him. 3
3
By the time he was twenty-five Edward Derby was a prodigiously learned man 3
and a fairly well known poet and fantaisiste though his lack of contacts and 3
responsibilities had slowed down his literary growth by making his products 3
derivative and over-bookish. I was perhaps his closest friend - finding him an 3
inexhaustible mine of vital theoretical topics, while he relied on me for advice in 3
whatever matters he did not wish to refer to his parents. He remained single - 3
more through shyness, inertia, and parental protectiveness than through 3
inclination - and moved in society only to the slightest and most perfunctory 3
extent. When the war came both health and ingrained timidity kept him at home. 3
I went to Plattsburg for a commission but never got overseas. 3
3
So the years wore on. Edward's mother died when he was thirty four and for 3
months he was incapacitated by some odd psychological malady. His father took 3
him to Europe, however, and he managed to pull out of his trouble without 3
visible effects. Afterward he seemed to feel a sort of grotesque exhilaration, as if 3
of partial escape from some unseen bondage. He began to mingle in the more 3
"advanced" college set despite his middle age, and was present at some 3
extremely wild doings - on one occasion paying heavy blackmail (which he 3
borrowed of me) to keep his presence at a certain affair from his father's notice. 3
Some of the whispered rumors about the wild Miskatonic set were extremely 3
singular. There was even talk of black magic and of happenings utterly beyond 3
credibility. 3

3
Edward was thirty-eight when he met Asenath Waite. She was, I judge, about 3
twenty-three at the time; and was taking a special course in mediaeval 3
metaphysics at Miskatonic. The daughter of a friend of mine had met her before - 3
in the Hall School at Kingsport - and had been inclined to shun her because of 3
her odd reputation. She was dark, smallish, and very good-looking except for 3
overprotuberant eyes; but something in her expression alienated extremely 3
sensitive people. It was, however, largely her origin and conversation which 3
caused average folk to avoid her. She was one of the Innsmouth Waites, and dark 3
legends have clustered for generations about crumbling, half-deserted 3
Innsmouth and its people. There are tales of horrible bargains about the year 3
1850, and of a strange element "not quite human" in the ancient families of the 3
run-down fishing port - tales such as only old-time Yankees can devise and 3
repeat with proper awesomeness. 3
3
Asenath's case was aggravated by the fact that she was Ephraim Waite's 3
daughter - the child of his old age by an unknown wife who always went veiled. 3
Ephraim lived in a half-decayed mansion in Washington Street, Innsmouth, and 3
those who had seen the place (Arkham folk avoid going to Innsmouth whenever 3
they can) declared that the attic windows were always boarded, and that strange 3
sounds sometimes floated from within as evening drew on. The old man was 3
known to have been a prodigious magical student in his day, and legend averred 3
that he could raise or quell storms at sea according to his whim. I had seen him 3
once or twice in my youth as he came to Arkham to consult forbidden tomes at 3
the college library, and had hated his wolfish, saturnine face with its tangle of 3
iron-grey beard. He had died insane - under rather queer circumstances - just 3
before his daughter (by his will made a nominal ward of the principal) entered 3
the Hall School, but she had been his morbidly avid pupil and looked fiendishly 3
like him at times. 3
3
The friend whose daughter had gone to school with Asenath Waite repeated 3
many curious things when the news of Edward's acquaintance with her began to 3
spread about. Asenath, it seemed, had posed as a kind of magician at school; and 3
had really seemed able to accomplish some highly baffling marvels. She 3
professed to be able to raise thunderstorms, though her seeming success was 3
generally laid to some uncanny knack at prediction. All animals markedly 3
disliked her, and she could make any dog howl by certain motions of her right 3
hand. There were times when she displayed snatches of knowledge and 3
language very singular - and very shocking - for a young girl; when she would 3
frighten her schoolmates with leers and winks of an inexplicable kind, and 3
would seem to extract an obscene zestful irony from her present situation. 3
3
Most unusual, though, were the well-attested cases of her influence over other 3
persons. She was, beyond question, a genuine hypnotist. By gazing peculiarly at 3
3
3
3
875 3
3
3
3
a fellow-student she would often give the latter a distinct feeling of exchanged 3
personality - as if the subject were placed momentarily in the magician's body 3
and able to stare half across the room at her real body, whose eyes blazed and 3
protruded with an alien expression. Asenath often made wild claims about the 3
nature of consciousness and about its independence of the physical frame - or at 3
least from the life-processes of the physical frame. Her crowning rage, however, 3
was that she was not a man; since she believed a male brain had certain unique 3
and far-reaching cosmic powers. Given a man's brain, she declared, she could 3
not only equal but surpass her father in mastery of unknown forces. 3
3
Edward met Asenath at a gathering of "intelligentsia" held in one of the 3
students' rooms, and could talk of nothing else when he came to see me the next 3
day. He had found her full of the interests and erudition which engrossed him 3
most, and was in addition wildly taken with her appearance. I had never seen 3
the young woman, and recalled casual references only faintly, but I knew who 3
she was. It seemed rather regrettable that Derby should become so upheaved 3
about her; but I said nothing to discourage him, since infatuation thrives on 3
opposition. He was not, he said, mentioning her to his father. 3
3
In the next few weeks I heard of very little but Asenath from young Derby. 3
Others now remarked Edward's autumnal gallantry, though they agreed that he 3
did not look even nearly his actual age, or seem at all inappropriate as an escort 3
for his bizarre divinity. He was only a trifle paunchy despite his indolence and 3
self-indulgence, and his face was absolutely without lines. Asenath, on the other 3
hand, had the premature crow's feet which come from the exercises of an intense 3
will. 3
3
About this time Edward brought the girl to call on me, and I at once saw that his 3
interest was by no means one-sided. She eyed him continually with an almost 3
predatory air, and I perceived that their intimacy was beyond untangling. Soon 3
afterward I had a visit from old Mr. Derby, whom I had always admired and 3
respected. He had heard the tales of his son's new friendship, and had wormed 3
the whole truth out of "the boy." Edward meant to marry Asenath, and had even 3
been looking at houses in the suburbs. Knowing my usually great influence with 3
his son, the father wondered if I could help to break the ill-advised affair off; but 3
I regretfully expressed my doubts. This time it was not a question of Edward's 3
weak will but of the woman's strong will. The perennial child had transferred his 3
dependence from the parental image to a new and stronger image, and nothing 3
could be done about it. 3
3
The wedding was performed a month later - by a justice of the peaoe, according 3
to the bride's request. Mr. Derby, at my advice, offered no opposition, and he, 3
my wife, my son, and I attended the brief ceremony - the other guests being wild 3
3
3
3
876 3
3
3
3
young people from the college. Asenath had bought the old Crowninshield place 3
in the country at the end of High Street, and they proposed to settle there after a 3
short trip to Innsmouth, whence three servants and some books and household 3
goods were to be brought. It was probably not so much consideration for 3
Edward and his father as a personal wish to be near the college, its library, and 3
its crowd of "sophisticates," that made Asenath settle in Arkham instead of 3
returning permanently home. 3
3
When Edward called on me after the honeymoon I thought he looked slightly 3
changed. Asenath had made him get rid of the undeveloped moustache, but 3
there was more than that. He looked soberer and more thoughtful, his habitual 3
pout of childish rebelliousness being exchanged for a look almost of genuine 3
sadness. I was puzzled to decide whether I liked or disliked the change. 3
Certainly he seemed for the moment more normally adult than ever before. 3
Perhaps the marriage was a good thing - might not the change of dependence 3
form a start toward actual neutralisaton, leading ultimately to responsible 3
independence? He came alone, for Asenath was very busy. She had brought a 3
vast store of books and apparatus from Innsmouth (Derby shuddered as he 3
spoke the name), and was finishing the restoration of the Crowninshield house 3
and grounds. 3
3
Her home - in that town - was a rather disgusting place, but certain objects in it 3
had taught him some surprising things. He was progressing fast in esoteric lore 3
now that he had Asenath's guidance. Some of the experiments she proposed 3
were very daring and radical - he did not feel at liberty to describe them - but he 3
had confidence in her powers and intentions. The three servants were very queer 3
- an incredibly aged couple who had been with old Ephraim and referred 3
occasionally to him and to Asenath's dead mother in a cryptic way, and a 3
swarthy young wench who had marked anomalies of feature and seemed to 3
exude a perpetual odour of fish. 3
3
Ill 3
3
For the next two years I saw less and less of Derby. A fortnight would sometimes 3
slip by without the familiar three-and-two strokes at the front door; and when he 3
did call - or when, as happened with increasing infrequency, I called on him - he 3
was very little disposed to converse on vital topics. He had become secretive 3
about those occult studies which he used to describe and discuss so minutely, 3
and preferred not to talk of his wife. She had aged tremendously since her 3
marriage, till now - oddly enough - she seemed the elder of the two. Her face 3
held the most concentratedly determined expression I had ever seen, and her 3
whole aspect seemed to gain a vague, unplaceable repulsiveness. My wife and 3
son noticed it as much as I, and we all ceased gradually to call on her - for which. 3
3
3
3
877 3
3
3
3
Edward admitted in one of his boyishly tactless moments, she was unmitigatedly 3
grateful. Occasionally the Derbys would go on long trips - ostensibly to Europe, 3
though Edward sometimes hinted at obscurer destinations. 3
3
It was after the first year that people began talking about the change in Edward 3
Derby. It was very casual talk, for the change was purely psychological; but it 3
brought up some interesting points. Now and then, it seemed Edward was 3
observed to wear an expression and to do things wholly incompatible with his 3
usual flabby nature. For example - although in the old days he could not drive a 3
car, he was now seen occasionally to dash into or out of the old Crowninshield 3
driveway with Asenath's powerful Packard, handling it like a master, and 3
meeting traffic entanglements with a skill and determination utterly alien to his 3
accustomed nature. In such cases he seemed always to be just back from some 3
trip or just starting on one - what sort of trip, no one could guess, although he 3
mostly favoured the Innsmouth road. 3
3
Oddly, the metamorphosis did not seem altogether pleasing. People said he 3
looked too much like his wife, or like old Ephraim Waite himself, in these 3
moments - or perhaps these moments seemed unnatural because they were so 3
rare. Sometimes, hours after starting out in this way, he would return listlessly 3
sprawled on the rear seat of the car while an obviously hired chauffeur or 3
mechanic drove. Also, his preponderant aspect on the streets during his 3
decreasing round of social contacts (including, I may say, his calls on me) was 3
the old-time indecisive one - its irresponsible childishness even more marked 3
than in the past. While Asenath's face aged, Edward - aside from those 3
exceptional occasions - actually relaxed into a kind of exaggerated immaturity, 3
save when a trace of the new sadness or understanding would flash across it. It 3
was really very puzzling. Meanwhile the Derbys almost dropped out of the gay 3
college circle - not through their own disgust, we heard, but because something 3
about their present studies shocked even the most callous of the other decadents. 3
3
It was in the third year of the marriage that Edward began to hint openly to me 3
of a certain fear and dissatisfaction. He would let fall remarks about things 3
"going too far," and would talk darkly about the need of "gaining his identity." 3
At first I ignored such references, but in time I began to question him guardedly, 3
remembering what my friend's daughter had said about Asenath's hypnotic 3
influence over the other girls at school - the cases where students had thought 3
they were in her body looking across the room at themselves. This questioning 3
seemed to make him at once alarmed and grateful, and once he mumbled 3
something about having a serious talk with me later. About this time old Mr. 3
Derby died, for which I was afterward very thankful. Edward was badly upset, 3
though by no means disorganized. He had seen astonishingly little of his parent 3
since his marriage, for Asenath had concentrated in herself all his vital sense of 3
3
3
3
878 3
3
3
3
family linkage. Some called him callous in his loss - especially since those jaunty 3
and confident moods in the car began to increase. He now wished to move back 3
into the old family mansion, but Asenath insisted on staying in the 3
Crowninshield house to which she had become well adjusted. 3
3
Not long afterward my wife heard a curious thing from a friend - one of the few 3
who had not dropped the Derbys. She had been out to the end of High Street to 3
call on the couple, and had seen a car shoot briskly out of the drive with 3
Edward's oddly confident and almost sneering face above the wheel. Ringing the 3
bell, she had been told by the repulsive wench that Asenath was also out; but 3
had chanced to look at the house in leaving. There, at one of Edward's library 3
windows, she had glimpsed a hastily withdrawn face - a face whose expression 3
of pain, defeat, and wistful hopelessness was poignant beyond description. It 3
was - incredibly enough in view of its usual domineering cast - Asenath' s; yet the 3
caller had vowed that in that instant the sad, muddled eyes of poor Edward were 3
gazing out from it. 3
3
Edward's calls now grew a trifle more frequent, and his hints occasionally 3
became concrete. What he said was not to be believed, even in centuried and 3
legend-haunted Arkham; but he threw out his dark lore with a sincerity and 3
convincingness which made one fear for his sanity. He talked about terrible 3
meetings in lonely places, of Cyclopean ruins in the heart of the Maine woods 3
beneath which vast staircases led down to abysses of nighted secrets, of complex 3
angles that led through invisible walls to other regions of space and time, and of 3
hideous exchanges of personality that permitted explorations in remote and 3
forbidden places, on other worlds, and in different space-time continua. 3
3
He would now and then back up certain crazy hints by exhibiting objects which 3
utterly nonplussed me - elusively coloured and bafflingly textured objects like 3
nothing ever heard of on earth, whose insane curves and surfaces answered no 3
conceivable purpose, and followed no conceivable geometry. These things, he 3
said, came "from outside"; and his wife knew how to get them. Sometimes - but 3
always in frightened and ambiguous whisper - he would suggest things about 3
old Ephraim Waite, whom he had seen occasionally at the college library in the 3
old days. These adumbrations were never specific, but seemed to revolve around 3
some especially horrible doubt as to whether the old wizard were really dead - in 3
a spiritual as well as corporeal sense. 3
3
At times Derby would halt abruptly in his revelations, and I wondered whether 3
Asenath could possibly have divined his speech at a distance and cut him off 3
through some unknown sort of telepathic mesmerism - some power of the kind 3
she had displayed at school. Certainly, she suspected that he told me things, for 3
as the weeks passed she tried to stop his visits with words and glances of a most 3
3
3
3
879 3
3
3
3
inexplicable potency. Only with difficulty could he get to see me, for although he 3
would pretend to be going somewhere else, some invisible force would generally 3
clog his motions or make him forget his destination for the time being. His visits 3
usually came when Asenath was way - "away in her own body," as he once 3
oddly put it. She always found out later - the servants watched his goings and 3
coming - but evidently she thought it inexpedient to do anything drastic. 3
3
IV 3
3
Derby had been married more than three years on that August day when I got 3
that telegram from Maine. I had not seen him for two months, but had heard he 3
was away "on business." Asenath was supposed to be with him, though 3
watchful gossip declared there was someone upstairs in the house behind the 3
doubly curtained windows. They had watched the purchases made by the 3
servants. And now the town marshal of Chesuncook had wired of the draggled 3
madman who stumbled out of the woods with delirious ravings and screamed to 3
me for protection. It was Edward - and he had been just able to recall his own 3
name and address. 3
3
Chesuncook is close to the wildest, deepest, and least explored forest belt in 3
Maine, and it took a whole day of feverish jolting through fantastic and 3
forbidding scenery to get there in a car. I found Derby in a cell at the town farm, 3
vacillating between frenzy and apathy. He knew me at once, and began pouring 3
out a meaningless, half-incoherent torrent of words in my direction. 3
3
"Dan, for God's sake! The pit of the shoggoths! Down the six thousand steps... 3
the abomination of abominations... I never would let her take me, and then I 3
found myself there - la! Shub-Niggurath! - The shape rose up from the altar, and 3
there were five hundred that howled - The Hooded Thing bleated 'Kamog! 3
Kamog!' - that was old Ephraim's secret name in the coven - 1 was there, where 3
she promised she wouldn't take me - A minute before I was locked in the library, 3
and then I was there where she had gone with my body - in the place of utter 3
blasphemy, the unholy pit where the black realm begins and the watcher guards 3
the gate - 1 saw a shoggoth - it changed shape - 1 can't stand it - I'll kill her if she 3
ever sends me there again - I'll kill that entity - her, him, it - I'll kill it! I'll kill it 3
with my own hands!" 3
3
It took me an hour to quiet him, but he subsided at last. The next day I got him 3
decent clothes in the village, and set out with him for Arkham. His fury of 3
hysteria was spent, and he was inclined to be silent, though he began muttering 3
darkly to himself when the car passed through Augusta - as if the sight of a city 3
aroused unpleasant memories. It was clear that he did not wish to go home; and 3
considering the fantastic delusions he seemed to have about his wife - delusions 3
3
3
3
880 3
3
3
3
undoubtedly springing from some actual hypnotic ordeal to which he had been 3
subjected - 1 thought it would be better if he did not. I would, I resolved, put him 3
up myself for a time; no matter what unpleasantness it would make with 3
Asenath. Later I would help him get a divorce, for most assuredly there were 3
mental factors which made this marriage suicidal for him. When we struck open 3
country again Derby's muttering faded away, and I let him nod and drowse on 3
the seat beside me as I drove. 3
3
During our sunset dash through Portland the muttering commenced again, more 3
distinctly than before, and as I listened I caught a stream of utterly insane drivel 3
about Asenath. The extent to which she had preyed on Edward's nerves was 3
plain, for he had woven a whole set of hallucinations around her. His present 3
predicament, he mumbled furtively, was only one of a long series. She was 3
getting hold of him, and he knew that some day she would never let go. Even 3
now she probably let him go only when she had to, because she couldn't hold on 3
long at a time. She constantly took his body and went to nameless places for 3
nameless rites, leaving him in her body and locking him upstairs - but sometimes 3
she couldn't hold on, and he would find himself suddenly in his own body again 3
in some far-off, horrible, and perhaps unknown place. Sometimes she'd get hold 3
of him again and sometimes she couldn't. Often he was left stranded somewhere 3
as I had found him - time and again he had to find his way home from frightful 3
distances, getting somebody to drive the car after he found it. 3
3
The worst thing was that she was holding on to him longer and longer at a time. 3
She wanted to be a man - to be fully human - that was why she got hold of him. 3
She had sensed the mixture of fine-wrought brain and weak will in him. Some 3
day she would crowd him out and disappear with his body - disappear to 3
become a great magician like her father and leave him marooned in that female 3
shell that wasn't even quite human. Yes, he knew about the Innsmouth blood 3
now. There had been traffick with things from the sea - it was horrible. . . And old 3
Ephraim - he had known the secret, and when he grew old did a hideous thing to 3
keep alive - he wanted to live forever - Asenath would succeed - one successful 3
demonstration had taken place already. 3
3
As Derby muttered on I turned to look at him closely, verifying the impression of 3
change which an earlier scrutiny had given me. Paradoxically, he seemed in 3
better shape than usual - harder, more normally developed, and without the 3
trace of sickly flabbiness caused by his indolent habits. It was as if he had been 3
really active and properly exercised for the first time in his coddled life, and I 3
judged that Asenath's force must have pushed him into unwonted channels of 3
motion and alertness. But just now his mind was in a pitiable state; for he was 3
mumbling wild extravagances about his wife, about black magic, about old 3
Ephraim, and about some revelation which would convince even me. He 3
3
3
3
881 3
3
3
3
repeated names which I recognized from bygone browsings in forbidden 3
volumes, and at times made me shudder with a certain thread of mythological 3
consistency - or convincing coherence - which ran through his maundering. 3
Again and again he would pause, as if to gather courage for some final and 3
terrible disclosure. 3
3
"Dan, Dan, don't you remember him - wild eyes and the unkempt beard that 3
never turned white? He glared at me once, and I never forgot it. Now she glares 3
that way. And I know why! He found it in the Necronomicon - the formula. I 3
don't dare tell you the page yet, but when I do you can read and understand. 3
Then you will know what has engulfed me. On, on, on, on - body to body to 3
body - he means never to die. The life-glow - he knows how to break the link. . . it 3
can flicker on a while even when the body is dead. I'll give you hints and maybe 3
you'll guess. Listen, Dan - do you know why my wife always takes such pains 3
with that silly backhand writing? Have you ever seen a manuscript of old 3
Ephraim's? Do you want to know why I shivered when I saw some hasty notes 3
Asenath had jotted down? 3
3
"Asenath - is there such a person? Why did they half-think there was poison in 3
old Ephraim's stomach? Why do the Gilmans whisper about the way he shrieked 3
- like a frightened child - when he went mad and Asenath locked him up in the 3
padded attic room where - the other - had been? Was it old Ephraim's soul that 3
was locked in? Who locked in whom? Why had he been looking for months for 3
someone with a fine mind and a weak will? - Why did he curse that his daughter 3
wasn't a son? Tell me? Daniel Upton - what devilish exchange was perpetrated in 3
the house of horror where that blasphemous monster had his trusting, weak- 3
willed half-human child at his mercy? Didn't he make it permanent - as she'll do 3
in the end with me? Tell me why that thing that calls itself Asenath writes 3
differently off guard, so that you can't tell its script from - " 3
3
Then the thing happened. Derby's voice was rising to a thin treble scream as he 3
raved, when suddenly it was shut off with an almost mechanical click. I thought 3
of those other occasions at my home when his confidences had abruptly ceased - 3
when I had half-fancied that some obscure telepathic wave of Asenath's mental 3
force was intervening to keep him silent. This, though, was something altogether 3
different - and, I felt, infinitely more horrible. The face beside me was twisted 3
almost unrecognizably for a moment, while through the whole body there 3
passed a shivering motion - as if all the bones, organs, muscles, nerves, and 3
glands were adjusting themselves to a radically different posture, set of stresses, 3
and general personality. 3
3
Just where the supreme horror lay, I could not for my life tell; yet there swept 3
over me such a swamping wave of sickness and repulsion - such a freezing. 3
3
3
3
882 3
3
3
3
petrifying sense of utter alienage and abnormality - that my grasp of the wheel 3
grew feeble and uncertain. The figure beside me seemed less like a lifelong friend 3
than like some monstrous intrusion from outer space - some damnable, utterly 3
accursed focus of unknown and malign cosmic forces. 3
3
I had faltered only a moment, but before another moment was over my 3
companion had seized the wheel and forced me to change places with him. The 3
dusk was now very thick, and the lights of Portland far behind, so I could not see 3
much of his face. The blaze of his eyes, though, was phenomenal; and I knew that 3
he must now be in that queerly energized state - so unlike his usual self - which 3
so many people had noticed. It seemed odd and incredible that listless Edward 3
Derby - he who could never assert himself, and who had never learned to drive - 3
should be ordering me about and taking the wheel of my own car, yet that was 3
precisely what had happened. He did not speak for some time, and in my 3
inexplicable horror I was glad he did not. 3
3
In the lights of Biddeford and Saco I saw his firmly set mouth, and shivered at 3
the blaze of his eyes. The people were right - he did look damnably like his wife 3
and like old Ephraim when in these moods. I did not wonder that the moods 3
were disliked - there was certainly something unnatural in them, and I felt the 3
sinister element all the more because of the wild ravings I had been hearing. This 3
man, for all my lifelong knowledge of Edward Pickman Derby, was a stranger - 3
an intrusion of some sort from the black abyss. 3
3
He did not speak until we were on a dark stretch of road, and when he did his 3
voice seemed utterly unfamiliar. It was deeper, firmer, and more decisive than I 3
had ever known it to be; while its accent and pronunciation were altogether 3
changed - though vaguely, remotely, and rather disturbingly recalling something 3
I could not quite place. There was, I thought, a trace of very profound and very 3
genuine irony in the timbre - not the flashy, meaninglessly jaunty pseudo-irony 3
of the callow "sophisticate," which Derby had habitually affected, but something 3
grim, basic, pervasive, and potentially evil. I marvelled at the self-possession so 3
soon following the spell of panic-struck muttering. 3
3
"I hope you'll forget my attack back there, Upton," he was saying. "You know 3
what my nerves are, and I guess you can excuse such things. I'm enormously 3
grateful, of course, for this lift home. 3
3
"And you must forget, too, any crazy things I may have been saying about my 3
wife - and about things in general. That's what comes from overstudy in a field 3
like mine. My philosophy is full of bizarre concepts, and when the mind gets 3
worn out it cooks up all sorts of imaginary concrete applications. I shall take a 3
3
3
3
883 3
3
3
3
rest from now on - you probably won't see me for some time, and you needn't 3
blame Asenath for it. 3
3
"This trip was a bit queer, but it's really very simple. There are certain Indian 3
relics in the north wood - standing stones, and all that - which mean a good deal 3
in folklore, and Asenath and I are following that stuff up. It was a hard search, so 3
I seem to have gone off my head. I must send somebody for the car when I get 3
home. A month's relaxation will put me on my feet." 3
3
I do not recall just what my own part of the conversation was, for the baffling 3
alienage of my seatmate filled all my consciousness. With every moment my 3
feeling of elusive cosmic horror increased, till at length I was in a virtual delirium 3
of longing for the end of the drive. Derby did not offer to relinquish the wheel, 3
and I was glad of the speed with which Portsmouth and Newburyport flashed 3
by. 3
3
At the junction where the main highway runs inland and avoids Innsmouth, I 3
was half-afraid my driver would take the bleak shore road that goes through that 3
damnable place. He did not, however, but darted rapidly past Rowley and 3
Ipswich toward our destination. We reached Arkham before midnight, and 3
found the lights still on at the old Crowninshield house. Derby left the car with a 3
hasty repetition of his thanks, and I drove home alone with a curious feeling of 3
relief. It had been a terrible drive - all the more terrible because I could not quite 3
tell why - and I did not regret Derby's forecast of a long absence from my 3
company. 3
3
The next two months were full of rumours. People spoke of seeing Derby more 3
and more in his new energized state, and Asenath was scarcely ever in to her 3
callers. I had only one visit from Edward, when he called briefly in Asenath's car 3
- duly reclaimed from wherever he had left it in Maine - to get some books he 3
had lent me. He was in his new state, and paused only long enough for some 3
evasively polite remarks. It was plain that he had nothing to discuss with me 3
when in this condition - and I noticed that he did not even trouble to give the old 3
three-and-two signal when ringing the doorbell. As on that evening in the car, I 3
felt a faint, infinitely deep horror which I could not explain; so that his swift 3
departure was a prodigious relief. 3
3
In mid-September Derby was away for a week, and some of the decadent college 3
set talked knowingly of the matter - hinting at a meeting with a notorious cult- 3
leader, lately expelled from England, who had established headquarters in New 3
York. For my part I could not get that strange ride from Maine out of my head. 3
The transformation I had witnessed had affected me profoundly, and I caught 3
3
3
3
884 3
3
3
3
myself again and again trying to account for the thing - and for the extreme 3
horror it had inspired in me. 3
3
But the oddest rumours were those about the sobbing in the old Crowninshield 3
house. The voice seemed to be a woman's, and some of the younger people 3
thought it sounded like Asenath's. It was heard only at rare intervals, and would 3
sometimes be choked off as if by force. There was talk of an investigation, but 3
this was dispelled one day when Asenath appeared in the streets and chatted in a 3
sprightly way with a large number of acquaintances - apologizing for her recent 3
absence and speaking incidentally about the nervous breakdown and hysteria of 3
a guest from Boston. The guest was never seen, but Asenath's appearance left 3
nothing to be said. And then someone complicated matters by whispering that 3
the sobs had once or twice been in a man's voice. 3
3
One evening in mid-October, I heard the familiar three-and-two ring at the front 3
door. Answering it myself, I found Edward on the steps, and saw in a moment 3
that his personality was the old one which I had not encountered since the day of 3
his ravings on that terrible ride from Chesuncook. His face was twitching with a 3
mixture of odd emotions in which fear and triumph seemed to share dominion, 3
and he looked furtively over his shoulder as I closed the door behind him. 3
3
Following me clumsily to the study, he asked for some whiskey to steady his 3
nerves. I forbore to question him, but waited till he felt like beginning whatever 3
he wanted to say. At length he ventured some information in a choking voice. 3
3
"Asenath has gone, Dan. We had a long talk last night while the servants were 3
out, and I made her promise to stop preying on me. Of course I had certain - 3
certain occult defences I never told you about. She had to give in, but got 3
frightfully angry. Just packed up and started for New York - walked right out to 3
catch the eight-twenty in to Boston. I suppose people will talk, but I can't help 3
that. You needn't mention that there was any trouble - just say she's gone on a 3
long research trip. 3
3
"She's probably going to stay with one of her horrible groups of devotees. I hope 3
she'll go west and get a divorce - anyhow, I've made her promise to keep away 3
and let me alone. It was horrible, Dan - she was stealing my body - crowding me 3
out - making a prisoner of me. I lay low and pretended to let her do it, but I had 3
to be on the watch. I could plan if I was careful, for she can't read my mind 3
literally, or in detail. All she could read of my planning was a sort of general 3
mood of rebellion - and she always thought I was helpless. Never thought I 3
could get the best of her. . . but I had a spell or two that worked." 3
3
Derby looked over his shoulder and took some more whiskey. 3
3
3
3
885 3
3
3
3
"I paid off those damned servants this morning when they got back. They were 3
ugly about it, and asked questions, but they went. They're her kin - Innsmouth 3
people - and were hand and glove with her. I hope they'll let me alone - 1 didn't 3
like the way they laughed when they walked away. I must get as many of Dad's 3
old servants again as I can. I'll move back home now. 3
3
"I suppose you think I'm crazy, Dan - but Arkham history ought to hint at things 3
that back up what I've told you - and what I'm going to tell you. You've seen one 3
of the changes, too - in your car after I told you about Asenath that day coming 3
home from Maine. That was when she got me - drove me out of my body. The 3
last thing I remember was when I was all worked up trying to tell you what that 3
she-devil is. Then she got me, and in a flash I was back at the house - in the 3
library where those damned servants had me locked up - and in that cursed 3
fiend's body that isn't even human. . . You know it was she you must have ridden 3
home with - that preying wolf in my body - You ought to have known the 3
difference!" 3
3
I shuddered as Derby paused. Surely, I had known the difference - yet could I 3
accept an explanation as insane as this? But my distracted caller was growing 3
even wilder. 3
3
"I had to save myself - 1 had to, Dan! She'd have got me for good at Hallowmass 3
- they hold a Sabbat up there beyond Chesuncook, and the sacrifice would have 3
clinched things. She'd have got me for good - she'd have been I, and I'd have 3
been she - forever - too late - My body'd have been hers for good - She'd have 3
been a man, and fully human, just as she wanted to be - 1 suppose she'd have put 3
me out of the way - killed her own ex-body with me in it, damn her, just as she 3
did before - just as she did, or it did before - " Edward's face was now atrociously 3
distorted, and he bent it uncomfortably close to mine as his voice fell to a 3
whisper. 3
3
"You must know what I hinted in the car - that she isn't Asenath at all, but really 3
old Ephraim himself. I suspected it a year and a half ago, and I know it now. Her 3
handwriting shows it when she goes off guard - sometimes she jots down a note 3
in writing that's just like her father's manuscripts, stroke for stroke - and 3
sometimes she says things that nobody but an old man like Ephraim could say. 3
He changed forms with her when he felt death coming - she was the only one he 3
could find with the right kind of brain and a weak enough will - he got her body 3
permanently, just as she almost got mine, and then poisoned the old body he'd 3
put her into. Haven't you seen old Ephraim's soul glaring out of that she-devil's 3
eyes dozens of times - and out of mine when she has control of my body?" 3
3
3
3
886 3
3
3
3
The whisperer was panting, and paused for breath. I said nothing; and when he 3
resumed his voice was nearer normal. This, I reflected, was a case for the asylum, 3
but I would not be the one to send him there. Perhaps time and freedom from 3
Asenath would do its work. I could see that he would never wish to dabble in 3
morbid occultism again. 3
3
"I'll tell you more later - I must have a long rest now. I'll tell you something of 3
the forbidden horrors she led me into - something of the age-old horrors that 3
even now are festering in out-of-the-way corners with a few monstrous priests to 3
keep them alive. Some people know things about the universe that nobody ought 3
to know, and can do things that nobody ought to be able to do. I've been in it up 3
to my neck, but that's the end. Today I'd burn that damned Necronomicon and 3
all the rest if I were librarian at Miskatonic. 3
3
"But she can't get me now. I must get out of that accursed house as soon as I can, 3
and settle down at home. You'll help me, I know, if I need help. Those devilish 3
servants, you know - and if people should get too inquisitive about Asenath. You 3
see, I can't give them her address... Then there are certain groups of searchers - 3
certain cults, you know - that might misunderstand our breaking up... some of 3
them have damnably curious ideas and methods. I know you'll stand by me if 3
anything happens - even if I have to tell you a lot that will shock you. . ." 3
3
I had Edward stay and sleep in one of the guest-chambers that night, and in the 3
morning he seemed calmer. We discussed certain possible arrangements for his 3
moving back into the Derby mansion, and I hoped he would lose no time in 3
making the change. He did not call the next evening, but I saw him frequently 3
during the ensuing weeks. We talked as little as possible about strange and 3
unpleasant things, but discussed the renovation of the old Derby house, and the 3
travels which Edward promised to take with my son and me the following 3
summer. 3
3
Of Asenath we said almost nothing, for I saw that the subject was a peculiarly 3
disturbing one. Gossip, of course, was rife; but that was no novelty in connection 3
with the strange menage at the old Crowninshield house. One thing I did not like 3
was what Derby's banker let fall in an over-expansive mood at the Miskatonic 3
Club - about the cheques Edward was sending regularly to a Moses and Abigail 3
Sargent and a Eunice Babson in Innsmouth. That looked as if those evil-faced 3
servants were extorting some kind of tribute from him - yet he had not 3
mentioned the matter to me. 3
3
I wished that the summer - and my son's Harvard vacation - would come, so that 3
we could get Edward to Europe. He was not, I soon saw, mending as rapidly as I 3
had hoped he would; for there was something a bit hysterical in his occasional 3
3
3
3
887 3
3
3
3
exhilaration, while his moods of fright and depression were altogether too 3
frequent. The old Derby house was ready by December, yet Edward constantly 3
put off moving. Though he hated and seemed to fear the Crowninshield place, he 3
was at the same time queerly enslaved by it. He could not seem to begin 3
dismantling things, and invented every kind of excuse to postpone action. When 3
I pointed this out to him he appeared unaccountably frightened. His father's old 3
butler - who was there with other reacquired servants - told me one day that 3
Edward's occasional prowlings about the house, and especially down cellar, 3
looked odd and unwholesome to him. I wondered if Asenath had been writing 3
disturbing letters, but the butler said there was no mail which could have come 3
from her. 3
3
It was about Christmas that Derby broke down one evening while calling on me. 3
I was steering the conversation toward next summer's travels when he suddenly 3
shrieked and leaped up from his chair with a look of shocking, uncontrollable 3
fright - a cosmic panic and loathing such as only the nether gulfs of nightmare 3
could bring to any sane mind. 3
3
"My brain! My brain! God, Dan - it's tugging - from beyond - knocking - clawing 3
- that she-devil - even now - Ephraim - Kamog! Kamog! - The pit of the 3
shoggoths - la! Shub-Niggurath! The Goat with a Thousand Young!. . . 3
3
"The flame - the flame - beyond body, beyond life - in the earth - oh, God!" 3
3
I pulled him back to his chair and poured some wine down his throat as his 3
frenzy sank to a dull apathy. He did not resist, but kept his lips moving as if 3
talking to himself. Presently I realized that he was trying to talk to me, and bent 3
my ear to his mouth to catch the feeble words. 3
3
"Again, again - she's trying - I might have known - nothing can stop that force; 3
not distance nor magic, nor death - it comes and comes, mostly in the night - I 3
can't leave - it's horrible - oh, God, Dan, if you only knew as I do just how 3
horrible it is..." 3
3
When he had slumped down into a stupor I propped him with pillows and let 3
normal sleep overtake him. I did not call a doctor, for I knew what would be said 3
of his sanity, and wished to give nature a chance if I possibly could. He waked at 3
midnight, and I put him to bed upstairs, but he was gone by morning. He had let 3
himself quietly out of the house - and his butler, when called on the wire, said he 3
was at home pacing about the library. 3
3
Edward went to pieces rapidly after that. He did not call again, but I went daily 3
to see him. He would always be sitting in his library, staring at nothing and 3
3
3
3
888 3
3
3
3
having an air of abnormal listening. Sometimes he talked rationally, but always 3
on trivial topics. Any mention of his trouble, of future plans, or of Asenath 3
would send him into a frenzy. His butler said he had frightful seizures at night, 3
during which he might eventually do himself harm. 3
3
I had a long talk with his doctor, banker, and lawyer, and finally took the 3
physician with two specialist colleagues to visit him. The spasms that resulted 3
from the first questions were violent and pitiable - and that evening a closed car 3
took his poor struggling body to the Arkham Sanitarium. I was made his 3
guardian and called on him twice weekly - almost weeping to hear his wild 3
shrieks, awesome whispers, and dreadful, droning repetitions of such phrases as 3
"I had to do it - I had to do it - it'll get me - it'll get me - down there - down there 3
in the dark - Mother! Mother! Dan! Save me - save me -" 3
3
How much hope of recovery there was, no one could say, but I tried my best to 3
be optimistic. Edward must have a home if he emerged, so I transferred his 3
servants to the Derby mansion, which would surely be his sane choice. What to 3
do about the Crowninshield place with its complex arrangements and collections 3
of utterly inexplicable objects I could not decide, so left it momentarily 3
untouched - telling the Derby household to go over and dust the chief rooms 3
once a week, and ordering the furnace man to have a fire on those days. 3
3
The final nightmare came before Candlemas - heralded, in cruel irony, by a false 3
gleam of hope. One morning late in January the sanitarium telephoned to report 3
that Edward's reason had suddenly come back. His continuous memory, they 3
said, was badly impaired; but sanity itself was certain. Of course he must remain 3
some time for observation, but there could be little doubt of the outcome. All 3
going well, he would surely be free in a week. 3
3
I hastened over in a flood of delight, but stood bewildered when a nurse took me 3
to Edward's room. The patient rose to greet me, extending his hand with a polite 3
smile; but I saw in an instant that he bore the strangely energized personality 3
which had seemed so foreign to his own nature - the competent personality I had 3
found so vaguely horrible, and which Edward himself had once vowed was the 3
intruding soul of his wife. There was the same blazing vision - so like Asenath's 3
and old Ephraim's - and the same firm mouth; and when he spoke I could sense 3
the same grim, pervasive irony in his voice - the deep irony so redolent of 3
potential evil. This was the person who had driven my car through the night five 3
months before - the person I had not seen since that brief call when he had 3
forgotten the oldtime doorbell signal and stirred such nebulous fears in me - and 3
now he filled me with the same dim feeling of blasphemous alienage and 3
ineffable cosmic hideousness. 3
3
3
3
889 3
3
3
3
He spoke affably of arrangements for release - and there was nothing for me to 3
do but assent, despite some remarkable gaps in his recent memories. Yet I felt 3
that something was terribly, inexplicably wrong and abnormal. There were 3
horrors in this thing that I could not reach. This was a sane person - but was it 3
indeed the Edward Derby I had known? If not, who or what was it - and where 3
was Edward? Ought it to be free or confined - or ought it to be extirpated from 3
the face of the earth? There was a hint of the abysmally sardonic in everything 3
the creature said - the Asenath-like eyes lent a special and baffling mockery to 3
certain words about the early liberty earned by an especially close confinement! I 3
must have behaved very awkwardly, and was glad to beat a retreat. 3
3
All that day and the next I racked my brain over the problem. What had 3
happened? What sort of mind looked out through those alien eyes in Edward's 3
face? I could think of nothing but this dimly terrible enigma, and gave up all 3
efforts to perform my usual work. The second morning the hospital called up to 3
say that the recovered patient was unchanged, and by evening I was close to a 3
nervous collapse-a state I admit, though others will vow it coloured my 3
subsequent vision. I have nothing to say on this point except that no madness of 3
mine could account for all the evidence. 3
3
V 3
3
It was in the night-after that second evening - that stark, utter horror burst over 3
me and weighted my spirit with a black, clutching panic from which it can never 3
shake free. It began with a telephone call just before midnight. I was the only one 3
up, and sleepily took down the receiver in the library. No one seemed to be on 3
the wire, and I was about to hang up and go to bed when my ear caught a very 3
faint suspicion of sound at the other end. Was someone trying under great 3
difficulties to talk? As I listened I thought I heard a sort of half-liquid bubbling 3
noise - "glub... glub... glub" - which had an odd suggestion of inarticulate, 3
unintelligible word and syllable divisions. I called "Who is it?" But the only 3
answer was "glub... glub... glub-glub." I could only assume that the noise was 3
mechanical; but fancying that it might be a case of a broken instrument able to 3
receive but not to send, I added, "I can't hear you. Better hang up and try 3
Information." Immediately I heard the receiver go on the hook at the other end. 3
3
This, I say, was just about midnight. When the call was traced afterward it was 3
found to come from the old Crowninshield house, though it was fully half a 3
week from the housemaid's day to be there. I shall only hint what was found at 3
that house - the upheaval in a remote cellar storeroom, the tracks, the dirt, the 3
hastily rifled wardrobe, the baffling marks on the telephone, the clumsily used 3
stationery, and the detestable stench lingering over everything. The police, poor 3
fools, have their smug little theories, and are still searching for those sinister 3
3
3
3
890 3
3
3
3
discharged servants - who have dropped out of sight amidst the present furore. 3
They speak of a ghouhsh revenge for things that were done, and say I was 3
included because I was Edward's best friend and adviser. 3
3
Idiots! Do they fancy those brutish clowns could have forged that handwriting? 3
Do they fancy they could have brought what later came? Are they blind to the 3
changes in that body that was Edward's? As for me, I now believe all that 3
Edward Derby ever told me. There are horrors beyond life's edge that we do not 3
suspect, and once in a while man's evil prying calls them just within our range. 3
Ephraim - Asenat - that devil called them in, and they engulfed Edward as they 3
are engulfing me. 3
3
Can I be sure that I am safe? Those powers survive the life of the physical form. 3
The next day - in the afternoon, when I pulled out of my prostration and was 3
able to walk and talk coherently - 1 went to the madhouse and shot him dead for 3
Edward's and the world's sake, but can I be sure till he is cremated? They are 3
keeping the body for some silly autopsies by different doctors - but I say he must 3
be cremated. He must be cremated - he who was not Edward Derby when I shot 3
him. I shall go mad if he is not, for I may be the next. But my will is not weak - 3
and I shall not let it be undermined by the terrors I know are seething around it. 3
One life - Ephraim, Asenath, and Edward - who now? I will not be driven out of 3
my body. . . I will not change souls with that bullet-ridden lich in the madhouse! 3
3
But let me try to tell coherently of that final horror. I will not speak of what the 3
police persistently ignored - the tales of that dwarfed, grotesque, malodorous 3
thing met by at least three wayfarers in High Street just before two o'clock, and 3
the nature of the single footprints in certain places. I will say only that just about 3
two the doorbell and knocker waked me - doorbell and knocker both, aplied 3
alternately and uncertainly in a kind of weak desperation, and each trying to 3
keep Edward's old signal of three-and-two strokes. 3
3
Roused from sound sleep, my mind leaped into a turmoil. Derby at the door - 3
and remembering the old code! That new personality had not remembered it... 3
was Edward suddenly back in his rightful state? Why was he here in such 3
evident stress and haste? Had he been released ahead of time, or had he escaped? 3
Perhaps, I thought as I flung on a robe and bounded downstairs, his return to his 3
own self had brought raving and violence, revoking his discharge and driving 3
him to a desperate dash for freedom. Whatever had happened, he was good old 3
Edward again, and I would help him! 3
3
When I opened the door into the elm-arched blackness a gust of insufferably 3
foetid wind almost flung me prostrate. I choked in nausea, and for a second 3
scarcely saw the dwarfed, humped figure on the steps. The summons had been 3
3
3
3
891 3
3
3
3
Edward's, but who was this foul, stunted parody? Where had Edward had time 3
to go? His ring had sounded only a second before the door opened. 3
3
The caller had on one of Edward's overcoats - its bottom almost touching the 3
ground, and its sleeves rolled back yet still covering the hands. On the head was 3
a slouch hat pulled low, while a black silk muffler concealed the face. As I 3
stepped unsteadily forward, the figure made a semi-liquid sound like that I had 3
heard over the telephone - "glub... glub..." - and thrust at me a large, closely 3
written paper impaled on the end of a long pencil. Still reeling from the morbid 3
and unaccountable foetor, I seized the paper and tried to read it in the light from 3
the doorway. 3
3
Beyond question, it was in Edward's script. But why had he written when he was 3
close enough to ring - and why was the script so awkward, coarse and shaky? I 3
could make out nothing in the dim half light, so edged back into the hall, the 3
dwarf figure clumping mechanically after but pausing on the inner door's 3
threshold. The odour of this singular messenger was really appalling, and I 3
hoped (not in vain, thank God!) that my wife would not wake and confront it. 3
3
Then, as I read the paper, I felt my knees give under me and my vision go black. I 3
was lying on the floor when I came to, that accursed sheet still clutched in my 3
fear-rigid hand. This is what it said. 3
3
"Dan - go to the sanitarium and kill it. Exterminate it. It isn't Edward Derby any 3
more. She got me - it's Asenath - and she has been dead three months and a half. 3
I lied when I said she had gone away. I killed her. I had to. It was sudden, but we 3
were alone and I was in my right body. I saw a candlestick and smashed her 3
head in. She would have got me for good at Hallowmass. 3
3
"I buried her in the farther cellar storeroom under some old boxes and cleaned 3
up all the traces. The servants suspected next morning, but they have such 3
secrets that they dare not tell the police. I sent them off, but God knows what 3
they - and others of the cult - will do. 3
3
"I thought for a while I was all right, and then I felt the tugging at my brain. I 3
knew what it was - I ought to have remembered. A soul like hers - or Ephraim's - 3
is half detached, and keeps right on after death as long as the body lasts. She was 3
getting me - making me change bodies with her-seizing my body and purting me 3
in that corpse of hers buried in the cellar. 3

in my body at the sanitarium - permanently, for it was after Hallowmass, and the 3

It was only afterward that I read the last half of this paper, for I had fainted at the 3
end of the third paragraph. I fainted again when I saw and smelled what 3
cluttered up the threshold where the warm air had struck it. The messenger 3
would not move or have consciousness any more. 3
3
The butler, tougher-fibred than I, did not faint at what met him in the hall in the 3
morning. Instead, he telephoned the police. When they came I had been taken 3
upstairs to bed, but the - other mass - lay where it had collapsed in the night. The 3
men put handkerchiefs to their noses. 3
3
What they finally found inside Edward's oddly-assorted clothes was mostly 3
liquescent horror. There were bones, to - and a crushed-in skull. Some dental 3
work positively identified the skull as Asenath's. 3

In relating the circumstances which have led to my confinement within this 3
refuge for the demented, I am aware that my present position will create a 3
natural doubt of the authenticity of my narrative. It is an unfortunate fact that the 3
bulk of humanity is too limited in its mental vision to weigh with patience and 3
intelligence those isolated phenomena, seen and felt only by a psychologically 3
sensitive few, which lie outside its common experience. Men of broader intellect 3
know that there is no sharp distinction betwixt the real and the unreal; that all 3
things appear as they do only by virtue of the delicate individual physical and 3
mental media through which we are made conscious of them; but the prosaic 3
materialism of the majority condemns as madness the flashes of supersight 3
which penetrate the common veil of obvious empricism. 3
3
My name is Jervas Dudley, and from earliest childhood I have been a dreamer 3
and a visionary. Wealthy beyond the necessity of a commercial life, and 3
temperamentally unfitted for the formal studies and social recreation of my 3
acquaintances, I have dwelt ever in realms apart from the visible world; 3
spending my youth and adolescence in ancient and little known books, and in 3
roaming the fields and groves of the region near my ancestral home. I do not 3
think that what I read in these books or saw in these fields and groves was 3
exactly what other boys read and saw there; but of this I must say little, since 3
detailed speech would but confirm those cruel slanders upon my intellect which 3
I sometimes overhear from the whispers of the stealthy attendants around me. It 3
is sufficient for me to relate events without analyzing causes. 3
3
I have said that I dwelt apart from the visible world, but I have not said that I 3
dwelt alone. This no human creature may do; for lacking the fellowship of the 3
living, he inevitably draws upon the companionship of things that are not, or are 3
no longer, living. Close by my home there lies a singular wooded hollow, in 3
whose twilight deeps I spent most of my time; reading, thinking, and dreaming. 3
Down its moss-covered slopes my first steps of infancy were taken, and around 3
its grotesquely gnarled oak trees my first fancies of boyhood were woven. Well 3
did I come to know the presiding dryads of those trees, and often have I watched 3
their wild dances in the struggling beams of a waning moon but of these things I 3
must not now speak. I will tell only of the lone tomb in the darkest of the hillside 3
thickets; the deserted tomb of the Hydes, an old and exalted family whose last 3
3
3
3
894 3
3
3
3
direct descendant had been laid within its black recesses many decades before 3
my birth. 3
3
The vault to which I refer is of ancient granite, weathered and discolored by the 3
mists and dampness of generations. Excavated back into the hillside, the 3
structure is visible only at the entrance. The door, a ponderous and forbidding 3
slab of stone, hangs upon rusted iron hinges, and is fastened ajar in a queerly 3
sinister way by means of heavy iron chains and padlocks, according to a 3
gruesome fashion of half a century ago. The abode of the race whose scions are 3
here inurned had once crowned the declivity which holds the tomb, but had long 3
since fallen victim to the flames which sprang up from a stroke of lightning. Of 3
the midnight storm which destroyed this gloomy mansion, the older inhabitants 3
of the region sometimes speak in hushed and uneasy voices; alluding to what 3
they call 'divine wrath' in a manner that in later years vaguely increased the 3
always strong fascination which I had felt for the forest-darkened sepulcher. One 3
man only had perished in the fire. When the last of the Hydes was buried in this 3
place of shade and stillness, the sad urnful of ashes had come from a distant 3
land, to which the family had repaired when the mansion burned down. No one 3
remains to lay flowers before the granite portal, and few care to brave the 3
depressing shadows which seem to linger strangely about the water-worn 3
stones. 3
3
I shall never forget the afternoon when first I stumbled upon the half-hidden 3
house of death. It was in midsummer, when the alchemy of nature transmutes 3
the sylvan landscape to one vivid and almost homogeneous mass of green; when 3
the senses are well-nigh intoxicated with the surging seas of moist verdure and 3
the subtly indefinable odors of the soil and the vegetation. In such surroundings 3
the mind loses its perspective; time and space become trivial and unreal, and 3
echoes of a forgotten prehistoric past beat insistently upon the enthralled 3
consciousness. 3
3
All day I had been wandering through the mystic groves of the hollow; thinking 3
thoughts I need not discuss, and conversing with things I need not name. In 3
years a child of ten, I had seen and heard many wonders unknown to the throng; 3
and was oddly aged in certain respects. When, upon forcing my way between 3
two savage clumps of briars, I suddenly encountered the entrance of the vault, I 3
had no knowledge of what I had discovered. The dark blocks of granite, the door 3
so curiously ajar, and the funeral carvings above the arch, aroused in me no 3
associations of mournful or terrible character. Of graves and tombs I knew and 3
imagined much, but had on account of my peculiar temperament been kept from 3
all personal contact with churchyards and cemeteries. The strange stone house 3
on the woodland slope was to me only a source of interest and speculation; and 3
its cold, damp interior, into which I vainly peered through the aperture so 3
3
3
3
895 3
3
3
3
tantalizingly left, contained for me no hint of death or decay. But in that instant 3
of curiosity was born the madly unreasoning desire which has brought me to this 3
hell of confinement. Spurred on by a voice which must have come from the 3
hideous soul of the forest, I resolved to enter the beckoning gloom in spite of the 3
ponderous chains which barred my passage. In the waning light of day I 3
alternately rattled the rusty impediments with a view to throwing wide the stone 3
door, and essayed to squeeze my slight form through the space already 3
provided; but neither plan met with success. At first curious, I was now frantic; 3
and when in the thickening twilight I returned to my home, I had sworn to the 3
hundred gods of the grove that at any cost I would some day force an entrance to 3
the black, chilly depths that seemed calling out to me. The physician with the 3
iron-grey beard who comes each day to my room, once told a visitor that this 3
decision marked the beginning of a pitiful monomania; but I will leave final 3
judgment to my readers when they shall have learnt all. 3
3
The months following my discovery were spent in futile attempts to force the 3
complicated padlock of the slightly open vault, and in carefully guarded 3
inquiries regarding the nature and history of the structure. With the traditionally 3
receptive ears of the small boy, I learned much; though an habitual secretiveness 3
caused me to tell no one of my information or my resolve. It is perhaps worth 3
mentioning that I was not at all surprised or terrified on learning of the nature of 3
the vault. My rather original ideas regarding life and death had caused me to 3
associate the cold clay with the breathing body in a vague fashion; and I felt that 3
the great and sinister family of the burned-down mansion was in some way 3
represented within the stone space I sought to explore. Mumbled tales of the 3
weird rites and godless revels of bygone years in the ancient hall gave to me a 3
new and potent interest in the tomb, before whose door I would sit for hours at a 3
time each day. Once I thrust a candie within the nearly closed entrance, but could 3
see nothing save a flight of damp stone steps leading downward. The odor of the 3
place repelled yet bewitched me. I felt I had known it before, in a past remote 3
beyond all recollection; beyond even my tenancy of the body I now possess. 3
3
The year after I first beheld the tomb, I stumbled upon a worm-eaten translation 3
of Plutarch's Lives in the book-filled attic of my home. Reading the life of 3
Theseus, I was much impressed by that passage telling of the great stone beneath 3
which the boyish hero was to find his tokens of destiny whenever he should 3
become old enough to lift its enormous weight. The legend had the effect of 3
dispelling my keenest impatience to enter the vault, for it made me feel that the 3
time was not yet ripe. Later, I told myself, I should grow to a strength and 3
ingenuity which might enable me to unfasten the heavily chained door with ease; 3
but until then I would do better by conforming to what seemed the will of Fate. 3
3
3
3
896 3
3
3
3
Accordingly my watches by the dank portal became less persistent, and much of 3
my time was spent in other though equally strange pursuits. I would sometimes 3
rise very quietly in the night, stealing out to walk in those church-yards and 3
places of burial from which I had been kept by my parents. What I did there I 3
may not say, for I am not now sure of the reality of certain things; but I know 3
that on the day after such a nocturnal ramble I would often astonish those about 3
me with my knowledge of topics almost forgotten for many generations. It was 3
after a night like this that I shocked the community with a queer conceit about 3
the burial of the rich and celebrated Squire Brewster, a maker of local history 3
who was interred in 1711, and whose slate headstone, bearing a graven skull and 3
crossbones, was slowly crumbling to powder. In a moment of childish 3
imagination I vowed not only that the undertaker, Goodman Simpson, had 3
stolen the silver-buckled shoes, silken hose, and satin small-clothes of the 3
deceased before burial; but that the Squire himself, not fully inanimate, had 3
turned twice in his mound- covered coffin on the day after interment. 3
3
But the idea of entering the tomb never left my thoughts; being indeed 3
stimulated by the unexpected genealogical discovery that my own maternal 3
ancestry possessed at least a slight link with the supposedly extinct family of the 3
Hydes. Last of my paternal race, I was likewise the last of this older and more 3
mysterious line. I began to feel that the tomb was mine, and to look forward with 3
hot eagerness to the time when I might pass within that stone door and down 3
those slimy stone steps in the dark. I now formed the habit of listening very 3
intently at the slightly open portal, choosing my favorite hours of midnight 3
stillness for the odd vigil. By the time I came of age, I had made a small clearing 3
in the thicket before the mold-stained facade of the hillside, allowing the 3
surrounding vegetation to encircle and overhang the space like the walls and 3
roof of a sylvan bower. This bower was my temple, the fastened door my shrine, 3
and here I would lie outstretched on the mossy ground, thinking strange 3
thoughts and dreaming strange dreams. 3
3
The night of the first revelation was a sultry one. I must have fallen asleep from 3
fatigue, for it was with a distinct sense of awakening that I heard the voices. Of 3
these tones and accents I hesitate to speak; of their quality I will not speak; but I 3
may say that they presented certain uncanny differences in vocabulary, 3
pronunciation, and mode of utterance. Every shade of New England dialect, 3
from the uncouth syllables of the Puritan colonists to the precise rhetoric of fifty 3
years ago, seemed represented in that shadowy colloquy, though it was only 3
later that I noticed the fact. At the time, indeed, my attention was distracted from 3
this matter by another phenomenon; a phenomenon so fleeting that I could not 3
take oath upon its reality. I barely fancied that as I awoke, a light had been 3
hurriedly extinguished within the sunken sepulcher. I do not think I was either 3
astounded or panic-stricken, but I know that I was greatly and permanently 3
3
3
3
897 3
3
3
3
changed that night. Upon returning home I went with much directness to a 3
rotting chest in the attic, wherein I found the key which next day unlocked with 3
ease the barrier I had so long stormed in vain. 3
3
It was in the soft glow of late afternoon that I first entered the vault on the 3
abandoned slope. A spell was upon me, and my heart leaped with an exultation I 3
can but ill describe. As I closed the door behind me and descended the dripping 3
steps by the light of my lone candle, I seemed to know the way; and though the 3
candle sputtered with the stifling reek of the place, I felt singularly at home in the 3
musty, charnel- house air. Looking about me, I beheld many marble slabs 3
bearing coffins, or the remains of coffins. Some of these were sealed and intact, 3
but others had nearly vanished, leaving the silver handles and plates isolated 3
amidst certain curious heaps of whitish dust. Upon one plate I read the name of 3
Sir Geoffrey Hyde, who had come from Sussex in 1640 and died here a few years 3
later. In a conspicuous alcove was one fairly well preserved and untenanted 3
casket, adorned with a single name which brought me both a smile and a 3
shudder. An odd impulse caused me to climb upon the broad slab, extinguish 3
my candle, and lie down within the vacant box. 3
3
In the gray light of dawn I staggered from the vault and locked the chain of the 3
door behind me. I was no longer a young man, though but twenty-one winters 3
had chilled my bodily frame. Early-rising villagers who observed my homeward 3
progress looked at me strangely, and marveled at the signs of ribald revelry 3
which they saw in one whose life was known to be sober and solitary. I did not 3
appear before my parents till after a long and refreshing sleep. 3
3
Henceforward I haunted the tomb each night; seeing, hearing, and doing things I 3
must never recall. My speech, always susceptible to environmental influences, 3
was the first thing to succumb to the change; and my suddenly acquired 3
archaism of diction was soon remarked upon. Later a queer boldness and 3
recklessness came into my demeanor, till I unconsciously grew to possess the 3
bearing of a man of the world despite my lifelong seclusion. My formerly silent 3
tongue waxed voluble with the easy grace of a Chesterfield or the godless 3
cynicism of a Rochester. I displayed a peculiar erudition utterly unlike the 3
fantastic, monkish lore over which I had pored in youth; and covered the fly- 3
leaves of my books with facile impromptu epigrams which brought up 3
suggestions of Gay, Prior, and the sprightliest of the Augustan wits and 3
rimesters. One morning at breakfast I came close to disaster by declaiming in 3
palpably liquorish accents an effusion of Eighteenth Century bacchanalian mirth, 3
a bit of Georgian playfulness never recorded in a book, which ran something like 3
this: 3
3
3
3
898 3
3
3
3
Come hither, my lads, with your tankards of ale. And drink to the present before 3
it shall fail; Pile each on your platter a mountain of beef. For 'tis eating and 3
drinking that bring us relief: So fill up your glass. For life will soon pass; When 3
you're dead ye'll ne'er drink to your king or your lass! 3
3
Anacreon had a red nose, so they say; But what's a red nose if ye're happy and 3
gay? Gad split me! I'd rather be red whilst I'm here. Than white as a lily and 3
dead half a year! So Betty, my miss. Come give me a kiss; In hell there's no 3
innkeeper's daughter like this! 3
3
Young Harry, propp'd up just as straight as he's able. Will soon lose his wig and 3
slip under the table. But fill up your goblets and pass 'em around Better under 3
the table than under the ground! So revel and chaff As ye thirstily quaff: Under 3
six feet of dirt 'tis less easy to laugh! 3
3
The fiend strike me blue! I'm scarce able to walk. And damn me if I can stand 3
upright or talk! Here, landlord, bid Betty to summon a chair; I'll try home for a 3
while, for my wife is not there! So lend me a hand; I'm not able to stand. But I'm 3
gay whilst I linger on top of the land! 3
3
About this time I conceived my present fear of fire and thunderstorms. 3
Previously indifferent to such things, I had now an unspeakable horror of them; 3
and would retire to the innermost recesses of the house whenever the heavens 3
threatened an electrical display. A favorite haunt of mine during the day was the 3
ruined cellar of the mansion that had burned down, and in fancy I would picture 3
the structure as it had been in its prime. On one occasion I startled a villager by 3
leading him confidently to a shallow subcellar, of whose existence I seemed to 3
know in spite of the fact that it had been unseen and forgotten for many 3
generations. 3
3
At last came that which I had long feared. My parents, alarmed at the altered 3
manner and appearance of their only son, commenced to exert over my 3
movements a kindly espionage which threatened to result in disaster. I had told 3
no one of my visits to the tomb, having guarded my secret purpose with 3
religious zeal since childhood; but now I was forced to exercise care in threading 3
the mazes of the wooded hollow, that I might throw off a possible pursuer. My 3
key to the vault I kept suspended from a cord about my neck, its presence known 3
only to me. I never carried out of the sepulcher any of the things I came upon 3
whilst within its walls. 3
3
One morning as I emerged from the damp tomb and fastened the chain of the 3
portal with none too steady hand, I beheld in an adjacent thicket the dreaded 3
face of a watcher. Surely the end was near; for my bower was discovered, and 3
3
3
3
899 3
3
3
3
the objective of my nocturnal journeys revealed. The man did not accost me, so I 3
hastened home in an effort to overhear what he might report to my careworn 3
father. Were my sojourns beyond the chained door about to be proclaimed to the 3
world? Imagine my delighted astonishment on hearing the spy inform my parent 3
in a cautious whisper that I had spent the night in the bower outside the tomb; 3
my sleep-filmed eyes fixed upon the crevice where the padlocked portal stood 3
ajar! By what miracle had the watcher been thus deluded? I was now convinced 3
that a supernatural agency protected me. Made bold by this heaven-sent 3
circumstance, I began to resume perfect openness in going to the vault; confident 3
that no one could witness my entrance. For a week I tasted to the full joys of that 3
charnel conviviality which I must not describe, when the thing happened, and I 3
was borne away to this accursed abode of sorrow and monotony. 3
3
I should not have ventured out that night; for the taint of thunder was in the 3
clouds, and a hellish phosphoresence rose from the rank swamp at the bottom of 3
the hollow. The call of the dead, too, was different. Instead of the hillside tomb, it 3
was the charred cellar on the crest of the slope whose presiding demon beckoned 3
to me with unseen fingers. As I emerged from an intervening grove upon the 3
plain before the ruin, I beheld in the misty moonlight a thing I had always 3
vaguely expected. The mansion, gone for a century, once more reared its stately 3
height to the raptured vision; every window ablaze with the splendor of many 3
candles. Up the long drive rolled the coaches of the Boston gentry, whilst on foot 3
came a numerous assemblage of powdered exquisites from the neighboring 3
mansions. With this throng I mingled, though I knew I belonged with the hosts 3
rather than with the guests. Inside the hall were music, laughter, and wine on 3
every hand. Several faces I recognized; though I should have known them better 3
had they been shriveled or eaten away by death and decomposition. Amidst a 3
wild and reckless throng I was the wildest and most abandoned. Gay blasphemy 3
poured in torrents from my lips, and in shocking sallies I heeded no law of God, 3
or nature. 3
3
Suddenly a peal of thunder, resonant even above the din of the swinish revelry, 3
clave the very roof and laid a hush of fear upon the boisterous company. Red 3
tongues of flame and searing gusts of heat engulfed the house; and the 3
roysterers, struck with terror at the descent of a calamity which seemed to 3
transcend the bounds of unguided nature, fled shrieking into the night. I alone 3
remained, riveted to my seat by a groveling fear which I had never felt before. 3
And then a second horror took possession of my soul. Burnt alive to ashes, my 3
body dispersed by the four winds, I might never lie in the tomb of the Hydes! 3
Was not my coffin prepared for me? Had I not a right to rest till eternity amongst 3
the descendants of Sir Geoffrey Hyde? Aye! I would claim my heritage of death, 3
even though my soul go seeking through the ages for another corporeal 3
3
3
3
900 3
3
3
3
tenement to represent it on that vacant slab in the alcove of the vault. Jervas 3
Hyde should never share the sad fate of Palinurus! 3
3
As the phantom of the burning house faded, I found myself screaming and 3
struggling madly in the arms of two men, one of whom was the spy who had 3
followed me to the tomb. Rain was pouring down in torrents, and upon the 3
southern horizon were flashes of lightning that had so lately passed over our 3
heads. My father, his face lined with sorrow, stood by as I shouted my demands 3
to be laid within the tomb, frequently admonishing my captors to treat me as 3
gently as they could. A blackened circle on the floor of the ruined cellar told of a 3
violent stroke from the heavens; and from this spot a group of curious villagers 3
with lanterns were prying a small box of antique workmanship, which the 3
thunderbolt had brought to light. 3
3
Ceasing my futile and now objectless writhing, I watched the spectators as they 3
viewed the treasure- trove, and was permitted to share in their discoveries. The 3
box, whose fastenings were broken by the stroke which had unearthed it, 3
contained many papers and objects of value, but I had eyes for one thing alone. It 3
was the porcelain miniature of a young man in a smartly curled bag-wig, and 3
bore the initials 'J- H.' The face was such that as I gazed, I might well have been 3
studying my mirror. 3
3
On the following day I was brought to this room with the barred windows, but I 3
have been kept informed of certain things through an aged and simple-minded 3
servitor, for whom I bore a fondness in infancy, and who, like me, loves the 3
churchyard. What I have dared relate of my experiences within the vault has 3
brought me only pitying smiles. My father, who visits me frequently, declares 3
that at no time did I pass the chained portal, and swears that the rusted padlock 3
had not been touched for fifty years when he examined it. He even says that all 3
the village knew of my journeys to the tomb, and that I was often watched as I 3
slept in the bower outside the grim facade, my half-open eyes fixed on the 3
crevice that leads to the interior. Against these assertions I have no tangible proof 3
to offer, since my key to the padlock was lost in the struggle on that night of 3
horrors. The strange things of the past which I have learned during those 3
nocturnal meetings with the dead he dismisses as the fruits of my lifelong and 3
omnivorous browsing amongst the ancient volumes of the family library. Had it 3
not been for my old servant Hiram, I should have by this time become quite 3
convinced of my madness. 3
3
But Hiram, loyal to the last, has held faith in me, and has done that which impels 3
me to make public at least part of my story. A week ago he burst open the lock 3
which chains the door of the tomb perpetually ajar, and descended with a lantern 3
into the murky depths. On a slab in an alcove he found an old but empty coffin 3
3
3
3
901 3
3
3
3
whose tarnished plate bears the single word: Jervas. In that coffin and in that 3
vault they have promised me I shall be buried. 3

The Transition of Juan Romero 3
3
Written September 16, 1919 3
3
Published in Marginalia, Arkham House, 1944, p. 276-84 3
3
Of the events which took place at the Norton Mine on October eighteenth and 3
nineteenth, 1894, I have no desire to speak. A sense of duty to science is all that 3
impels me to recall, in the last years of my life, scenes and happenings fraught 3
with a terror doubly acute because I cannot wholly define it. But I believe that 3
before I die I should tell what I know of the - shall I say transition - of Juan 3
Romero. 3
3
My name and origin need not be related to posterity; in fact, I fancy it is better 3
that they should not be, for when a man suddenly migrates to the States or the 3
Colonies, he leaves his past behind him. Besides, what I once was is not in the 3
least relevant to my narrative; save perhaps the fact that during my service in 3
India I was more at home amongst white-bearded native teachers than amongst 3
my brother-officers. I had delved not a little into odd Eastern lore when 3
overtaken by the calamities which brought about my new life in America's vast 3
West - a life wherein I found it well to accept a name - my present one - which is 3
very common and carries no meaning. 3
3
In the summer and autumn of 1894 I dwelt in the drear expanses of the Cactus 3
Mountains, employed as a common labourer at the celebrated Norton Mine, 3
whose discovery by an aged prospector some years before had turned the 3
surrounding region from a nearly unpeopled waste to a seething cauldron of 3
sordid life. A cavern of gold, lying deep beneath a mountain lake, had enriched 3
its venerable finder beyond his wildest dreams, and now formed the seat of 3
extensive tunneling operations on the part of the corporation to which it had 3
finally been sold. Additional grottoes had been found, and the yield of yellow 3
metal was exceedingly great; so that a mighty and heterogeneous army of miners 3
toiled day and night in the numerous passages and rock hollows. The 3
Superintendent, a Mr. Arthur, often discussed the singularity of the local 3
geological formations; speculating on the probable extent of the chain of caves, 3
and estimating the future of the titanic mining enterprises. He considered the 3
auriferous cavities the result of the action of water, and believed the last of them 3
would soon be opened. 3
3
It was not long after my arrival and employment that Juan Romero came to the 3
Norton Mine. One of the large herd of unkempt Mexicans attracted thither from 3
the neighbouring country, he at first attracted attention only because of his 3
3
3
3
903 3
3
3
3
features; which though plainly of the Red Indian type, were yet remarkable for 3
their light colour and refined conformation, being vastly unlike those of the 3
average "greaser" or Piute of the locality. It is curious that although he differed 3
so widely from the mass of Hispanicised and tribal Indians, Romero gave not the 3
least impression of Caucasian blood. It was not the Castilian conquistador or the 3
American pioneer, but the ancient and noble Aztec, whom imagination called to 3
view when the silent peon would rise in the early morning and gaze in 3
fascination at the sun as it crept above the eastern hills, meanwhile stretching out 3
his arms to the orb as if in the performance of some rite whose nature he did not 3
himself comprehend. But save for his face, Romero was not in any way 3
suggestive of nobility. Ignorant and dirty, he was at home amongst the other 3
brown-skinned Mexicans; having come (so I was afterward told) from the very 3
lowest sort of surroundings. He had been found as a child in a crude mountain 3
hut, the only survivor of an epidemic which had stalked lethally by. Near the 3
hut, close to a rather unusual rock fissure, had lain two skeletons, newly picked 3
by vultures, and presumably forming the sole remains of his parents. No one 3
recalled their identity, and they were soon forgotten by the many. Indeed, the 3
crumbling of the adobe hut and the closing of the rock-fissure by a subsequent 3
avalanche had helped to efface even the scene from recollection. Reared by a 3
Mexican cattle-thief who had given him his name, Juan differed little from his 3
fellows. 3
3
The attachment which Romero manifested toward me was undoubtedly 3
commenced through the quaint and ancient Hindoo ring which I wore when not 3
engaged in active labour. Of its nature, and manner of coming into my 3
possession, I cannot speak. It was my last link with a chapter of my life forever 3
closed, and I valued it highly. Soon I observed that the odd-looking Mexican was 3
likewise interested; eyeing it with an expression that banished all suspicion of 3
mere covetousness. Its hoary hieroglyphs seemed to stir some faint recollection 3
in his untutored but active mind, though he could not possibly have beheld their 3
like before. Within a few weeks after his advent, Romero was like a faithful 3
servant to me; this notwithstanding the fact that I was myself but an ordinary 3
miner. Our conversation was necessarily limited. He knew but a few words of 3
English, while I found my Oxonian Spanish was something quite different from 3
the patois of the peon of New Spain. 3
3
The event which I am about to relate was unheralded by long premonitions. 3
Though the man Romero had interested me, and though my ring had affected 3
him peculiarly, I think that neither of us had any expectation of what was to 3
follow when the great blast was set off. Geological considerations had dictated 3
an extension of the mine directly downward from the deepest part of the 3
subterranean area; and the belief of the Superintendent that only solid rock 3
would be encountered, had led to the placing of a prodigious charge of 3
3
3
3
904 3
3
3
3
dynamite. With this work Romero and I were not connected, wherefore our first 3
knowledge of extraordinary conditions came from others. The charge, heavier 3
perhaps than had been estimated, had seemed to shake the entire mountain. 3
Windows in shanties on the slope outside were shattered by the shock, whilst 3
miners throughout the nearer passages were knocked from their feet. Jewel Lake, 3
which lay above the scene of action, heaved as in a tempest. Upon investigation it 3
was seen that a new abyss yawned indefinitely below the seat of the blast; an 3
abyss so monstrous that no handy line might fathom it, nor any lamp illuminate 3
it. Baffled, the excavators sought a conference with the Superintendent, who 3
ordered great lengths of rope to be taken to the pit, and spliced and lowered 3
without cessation till a bottom might be discovered. 3
3
Shortly afterward the pale-faced workmen apprised the Superintendent of their 3
failure. Firmly though respectfully, they signified their refusal to revisit the 3
chasm or indeed to work further in the mine until it might be sealed. Something 3
beyond their experience was evidently confronting them, for so far as they could 3
ascertain, the void below was infinite. The Superintendent did not reproach 3
them. Instead, he pondered deeply, and made plans for the following day. The 3
night shift did not go on that evening. At two in the morning a lone coyote on the 3
mountain began to howl dismally. From somewhere within the works a dog 3
barked an answer; either to the coyote - or to something else. A storm was 3
gathering around the peaks of the range, and weirdly shaped clouds scudded 3
horribly across the blurred patch of celestial light which marked a gibbous 3
moon's attempts to shine through many layers of cirro-stratus vapours. It was 3
Romero's voice, coming from the bunk above, that awakened me, a voice excited 3
and tense with some vague expectation I could not understand: 3
3
"Madre de Dios! - el sonido - ese sonido - oiga Vd! - lo oye Vd? - senor, THAT 3
SOUND!" 3
3
I listened, wondering what sound he meant. The coyote, the dog, the storm, all 3
were audible; the last named now gaining ascendancy as the wind shrieked more 3
and more frantically. Flashes of lightning were visible through the bunk-house 3
window. I questioned the nervous Mexican, repeating the sounds I had heard: 3
3
"El coyote - el perro - el viento?" 3
3
But Romero did not reply. Then he commenced whispering as in awe: 3
3
"El ritmo, senor - el ritmo de la tierra - THAT THROB DOWN IN THE 3
GROUND!" 3
3
3
3
905 3
3
3
3
And now I also heard; heard and shivered and without knowing why. Deep, 3
deep, below me was a sound - a rhythm, just as the peon had said - which, 3
though exceedingly faint, yet dominated even the dog, the coyote, and the 3
increasing tempest. To seek to describe it was useless - for it was such that no 3
description is possible. Perhaps it was like the pulsing of the engines far down in 3
a great liner, as sensed from the deck, yet it was not so mechanical; not so devoid 3
of the element of the life and consciousness. Of all its qualities, remoteness in the 3
earth most impressed me. To my mind rushed fragments of a passage in Joseph 3
Glanvil which Poe has quoted with tremendous effectl: 3
3
" the vastness, profundity, and unsearchableness of His works, which have a 3
3
depth in them greater than the well of Democritus." 3
3
Suddenly Romero leaped from his bunk, pausing before me to gaze at the 3
strange ring on my hand, which glistened queerly in every flash of lightning, and 3
then staring intently in the direction of the mine shaft. I also rose, and both of us 3
stood motionless for a time, straining our ears as the uncanny rhythm seemed 3
more and more to take on a vital quality. Then without apparent volition we 3
began to move toward the door, whose rattling in the gale held a comforting 3
suggestion of earthly reality. The chanting in the depths - for such the sound now 3
seemed to be - grew in volume and distinctness; and we felt irresistibly urged 3
out into the storm and thence to the gaping blackness of the shaft. 3
3
We encountered no living creature, for the men of the night shift had been 3
released from duty, and were doubtless at the Dry Gulch settlement pouring 3
sinister rumours into the ear of some drowsy bartender. From the watchman's 3
cabin, however, gleamed a small square of yellow light like a guardian eye. I 3
dimly wondered how the rhythmic sound had affected the watchman; but 3
Romero was moving more swiftly now, and I followed without pausing. 3
3
As we descended the shaft, the sound beneath grew definitely composite. It 3
struck me as horribly like a sort of Oriental ceremony, with beating of drums and 3
chanting of many voices. I have, as you are aware, been much in India. Romero 3
and I moved without material hesitancy through drifts and down ladders; ever 3
toward the thing that allured us, yet ever with a pitifully helpless fear and 3
reluctance. At one time I fancied I had gone mad - this was when, on wondering 3
how our way was lighted in the absence of lamp or candle, I realized that the 3
ancient ring on my finger was glowing with eerie radiance, diffusing a pallid 3
lustre through the damp, heavy air around. 3
3
It was without warning that Romero, after clambering down one of the many 3
wide ladders, broke into a run and left me alone. Some new and wild note in the 3
drumming and chanting, perceptible but slightly to me, had acted on him in a 3
3
3
3
906 3
3
3
3
startling fashion; and with a wild outcry he forged ahead unguided in the 3
cavern's gloom. I heard his repeated shrieks before me, as he stumbled 3
awkwardly along the level places and scrambled madly down the rickety 3
ladders. And frightened as I was, I yet retained enough of my perception to note 3
that his speech, when articulate, was not of any sort known to me. Harsh but 3
impressive polysyllables had replaced the customary mixture of bad Spanish and 3
worse English, and of these, only the oft repeated cry "Huitzilopotchli" seemed 3
in the least familiar. Later I definitely placed that word in the works of a great 3
historian! - and shuddered when the association came to me. 3
3
The climax of that awful night was composite but fairly brief, beginning just as I 3
reached the final cavern of the journey. Out of the darkness immediately ahead 3
burst a final shriek from the Mexican, which was joined by such a chorus of 3
uncouth sound as I could never hear again and survive. In that moment it 3
seemed as if all the hidden terrors and monstrosities of earth had become 3
articulate in an effort to overwhelm the human race. Simultaneously the light 3
from my ring was extinguished, and I saw a new light glimmering from lower 3
space but a few yards ahead of me. I had arrived at the abyss, which was now 3
redly aglow, and which had evidently swallowed up the unfortunate Romero. 3
Advancing, I peered over the edge of that chasm which no line could fathom, 3
and which was now a pandemonium of flickering flame and hideous uproar. At 3
first I beheld nothing but a seething blur of luminosity; but then shapes, all 3
infinitely distant, began to detach themselves from the confusion, and I saw - 3
was it Juan Romero? - but God! I dare not tell you what I saw! ...Some power 3
from heaven, coming to my aid, obliterated both sights and sounds in such a 3
crash as may be heard when two universes collide in space. Chaos supervened, 3
and I knew the peace of oblivion. 3
3
I hardly know how to continue, since conditions so singular are involved; but I 3
will do my best, not even trying to differentiate betwixt the real and the 3
apparent. When I awakened, I was safe in my bunk and the red glow of dawn 3
was visible at the window. Some distance away the lifeless body of Juan Romero 3
lay upon a table, surrounded by a group of men, including the camp doctor. The 3
men were discussing the strange death of the Mexican as he lay asleep; a death 3
seemingly connected in some way with the terrible bolt of lightning which had 3
struck and shaken the mountain. No direct cause was evident, and an autopsy 3
failed to show any reason why Romero should not be living. Snatches of 3
conversation indicated beyond a doubt that neither Romero nor I had left the 3
bunk-house during the night; that neither of us had been awake during the 3
frightful storm which had passed over the Cactus range. That storm, said men 3
who had ventured down the mine shaft, had caused extensive caving-in, and had 3
completely closed the deep abyss which had created so much apprehension the 3
day before. When I asked the watchman what sounds he had heard prior to the 3
3
3
3
907 3
3
3
3
mighty thunder-bolt; he mentioned a coyote, a dog, and the snarHng mountain 3
wind - nothing more. Nor do I doubt his word. 3
3
Upon the resumption of work. Superintendent Arthur called upon some 3
especially dependable men to make a few investigations around the spot where 3
the gulf had appeared. Though hardly eager, they obeyed, and a deep boring 3
was made. Results were very curious. The roof of the void, as seen when it was 3
open, was not by any means thick; yet now the drills of the investigators met 3
what appeared to be a limitless extent of solid rock. Finding nothing else, not 3
even gold, the Superintendent abandoned his attempts; but a perplexed look 3
occasionally steals over his countenance as he sits thinking at his desk. 3
3
One other thing is curious. Shortly after waking on that morning after the storm, 3
I noticed the unaccountable absence of my Hindoo ring from my finger. I had 3
prized it greatly, yet nevertheless felt a sensation of relief at its disappearance. If 3
one of my fellow-miners appropriated it, he must have been quite clever in 3
disposing of his booty, for despite advertisements and a police search, the ring 3
was never seen again. Somehow I doubt if it was stolen by mortal hands, for 3
many strange things were taught me in India. 3
3
My opinion of my whole experience varies from time to time. In broad daylight, 3
and at most seasons I am apt to think the greater part of it a mere dream; but 3
sometimes in the autumn, about two in the morning when the winds and 3
animals howl dismally, there comes from inconceivable depths below a 3
damnable suggestion of rhythmical throbbing ...and I feel that the transition of 3
Juan Romero was a terrible one indeed. 3

3
On a verdant slope of Mount Maenalus, in Arcadia, there stands an olive grove 3
about the ruins of a villa. Close by is a tomb, once beautiful with the sublimest 3
sculptures, but now fallen into as great decay as the house. At one end of that 3
tomb, its curious roots displacing the time-stained blocks of Panhellic marble, 3
grows an unnaturally large olive tree of oddly repellent shape; so like to some 3
grotesque man, or death- distorted body of a man, that the country folk fear to 3
pass it at night when the moon shines faintly through the crooked boughs. 3
Mount Maenalus is a chosen haunt of dreaded Pan, whose queer companions are 3
many, and simple swains believe that the tree must have some hideous kinship 3
to these weird Panisci; but an old bee-keeper who lives in the neighboring 3
cottage told me a different story. 3
3
Many years ago, when the hillside villa was new and resplendent, there dwelt 3
within it the two sculptors Kalos and Musides. From Lydia to Neapolis the 3
beauty of their work was praised, and none dared say that the one excelled the 3
other in skill. The Hermes of Kalos stood in a marble shrine in Corinth, and the 3
Pallas of Musides surmounted a pillar in Athens near the Parthenon. All men 3
paid homage to Kalos and Musides, and marvelled that no shadow of artistic 3
jealousy cooled the warmth of their brotherly friendship. 3
3
But though Kalos and Musides dwelt in unbroken harmony, their natures were 3
not alike. Whilst Musides revelled by night amidst the urban gaieties of Tegea, 3
Saios would remain at home; stealing away from the sight of his slaves into the 3
cool recesses of the olive grove. There he would meditate upon the visions that 3
filled his mind, and there devise the forms of beauty which later became 3
immortal in breathing marble. Idle folk, indeed, said that Kalos conversed with 3
the spirits of the grove, and that his statues were but images of the fauns and 3
dryads he met there for he patterned his work after no living model. 3
3
So famous were Kalos and Musides, that none wondered when the Tyrant of 3
Syracuse sent to them deputies to speak of the costly statue of Tyche which he 3
had planned for his city. Of great size and cunning workmanship must the statue 3
be, for it was to form a wonder of nations and a goal of travellers. Exalted 3
beyond thought would be he whose work should gain acceptance, and for this 3
honor Kalos and Musides were invited to compete. Their brotherly love was well 3
known, and the crafty Tyrant surmised that each, instead of concealing his work 3
3
3
3
909 3
3
3
3
from the other, would offer aid and advice; this charity producing two images of 3
unheard of beauty, the loveher of which would eclipse even the dreams of poets. 3
3
With joy the sculptors hailed the Tyrant's offer, so that in the days that followed 3
their slaves heard the ceaseless blows of chisels. Not from each other did Kalos 3
and Musides conceal their work, but the sight was for them alone. Saving theirs, 3
no eyes beheld the two divine figures released by skillful blows from the rough 3
blocks that had imprisoned them since the world began. 3
3
At night, as of yore, Musides sought the banquet halls of Tegea whilst Kalos 3
wandered alone in the olive Grove. But as time passed, men observed a want of 3
gaiety in the once sparkling Musides. It was strange, they said amongst 3
themselves that depression should thus seize one with so great a chance to win 3
art's loftiest reward. Many months passed yet in the sour face of Musides came 3
nothing of the sharp expectancy which the situation should arouse. 3
3
Then one day Musides spoke of the illness of Kalos, after which none marvelled 3
again at his sadness, since the sculptors' attachment was known to be deep and 3
sacred. Subsequently many went to visit Kalos, and indeed noticed the pallor of 3
his face; but there was about him a happy serenity which made his glance more 3
magical than the glance of Musides who was clearly distracted with anxiety and 3
who pushed aside all the slaves in his eagerness to feed and wait upon his friend 3
with his own hands. Hidden behind heavy curtains stood the two unfinished 3
figures of Tyche, little touched of late by the sick man and his faithful attendant. 3
3
As Kalos grew inexplicably weaker and weaker despite the ministrations of 3
puzzled physicians and of his assiduous friend, he desired to be carried often to 3
the grove which he so loved. There he would ask to be left alone, as if wishing to 3
speak with unseen things. Musides ever granted his requests, though his eyes 3
filled with visible tears at the thought that Kalos should care more for the fauns 3
and the dryads than for him. At last the end drew near, and Kalos discoursed of 3
things beyond this life. Musides, weeping, promised him a sepulchre more 3
lovely than the tomb of Mausolus; but Kalos bade him speak no more of marble 3
glories. Only one wish now haunted the mind of the dying man; that twigs from 3
certain olive trees in the grove be buried by his resting place-close to his head. 3
And one night, sitting alone in the darkness of the olive grove, Kalos died. 3
Beautiful beyond words was the marble sepulchre which stricken Musides 3
carved for his beloved friend. None but Kalos himself could have fashioned such 3
basreliefs, wherein were displayed all the splendours of Elysium. Nor did 3
Musides fail to bury close to Kalos' head the olive twigs from the grove. 3
3
As the first violence of Musides' grief gave place to resignation, he labored with 3
diligence upon his figure of Tyche. All honour was now his, since the Tyrant of 3
3
3
3
910 3
3
3
3
Syracuse would have the work of none save him or Kalos. His task proved a vent 3
for his emotion and he toiled more steadily each day, shunning the gaieties he 3
once had relished. Meanwhile his evenings were spent beside the tomb of his 3
friend, where a young olive tree had sprung up near the sleeper's head. So swift 3
was the growth of this tree, and so strange was its form, that all who beheld it 3
exclaimed in surprise; and Musides seemed at once fascinated and repelled. 3
3
Three years after the death of Kalos, Musides despatched a messenger to the 3
Tyrant, and it was whispered in the agora at Tegea that the mighty statue was 3
finished. By this time the tree by the tomb had attained amazing proportions, 3
exceeding all other trees of its kind, and sending out a singularly heavy branch 3
above the apartment in which Musides labored. As many visitors came to view 3
the prodigious tree, as to admire the art of the sculptor, so that Musides was 3
seldom alone. But he did not mind his multitude of guests; indeed, he seemed to 3
dread being alone now that his absorbing work was done. The bleak mountain 3
wind, sighing through the olive grove and the tomb-tree, had an uncanny way of 3
forming vaguely articulate sounds. 3
3
The sky was dark on the evening that the Tyrant's emissaries came to Tegea. It 3
was definitely known that they had come to bear away the great image of Tyche 3
and bring eternal honour to Musides, so their reception by the proxenoi was of 3
great warmth. As the night wore on a violent storm of wind broke over the crest 3
of Maenalus, and the men from far Syracuse were glad that they rested snugly in 3
the town. They talked of their illustrious Tyrant, and of the splendour of his 3
capital and exulted in the glory of the statue which Musides had wrought for 3
him. And then the men of Tegea spoke of the goodness of Musides, and of his 3
heavy grief for his friend and how not even the coming laurels of art could 3
console him in the absence of Kalos, who might have worn those laurels instead. 3
Of the tree which grew by the tomb, near the head of Kalos, they also spoke. The 3
wind shrieked more horribly, and both the Syracusans and the Arcadians prayed 3
to Aiolos. 3
3
In the sunshine of the morning the proxenoi led the Tyrant's messengers up the 3
slope to the abode of the sculptor, but the night wind had done strange things. 3
Slaves' cries ascended from a scene of desolation, and no more amidst the olive 3
grove rose the gleaming colonnades of that vast hall wherein Musides had 3
dreamed and toiled. Lone and shaken mourned the humble courts and the lower 3
walls, for upon the sumptuous greater peri-style had fallen squarely the heavy 3
overhanging bough of the strange new tree, reducing the stately poem in marble 3
with odd completeness to a mound of unsightly ruins. Strangers and Tegeans 3
stood aghast, looking from the wreckage to the great, sinister tree whose aspect 3
was so weirdly human and whose roots reached so queerly into the sculptured 3
sepulchre of Kalos. And their fear and dismay increased when they searched the 3
3
3
3
911 3
3
3
3
fallen apartment, for of the gentle Musides, and of the marvellously fashioned 3
image of Tyche, no trace could be discovered. Amidst such stupendous ruin only 3
chaos dwelt, and the representatives of two cities left disappointed; Syracusans 3
that they had no statue to bear home, Tegeans that they had no artist to crown. 3
However, the Syracusans obtained after a while a very splendid statue in Athens, 3
and the Tegeans consoled themselves by erecting in the agora a marble temple 3
commemorating the gifts, virtues, and brotherly piety of Musides. 3
3
But the olive grove still stands, as does the tree growing out of the tomb of Kalos, 3
and the old bee-keeper told me that sometimes the boughs whisper to one 3
another in the night wind, saying over and over again. "Oida! Oida! -I know! I 3
know!" 3

We were sitting on a dilapidated seventeenth-century tomb in the late afternoon 3
of an autumn day at the old burying ground in Arkham, and speculating about 3
the unnamable. Looking toward the giant willow in the cemetery, whose trunk 3
had nearly engulfed an ancient, illegible slab, I had made a fantastic remark 3
about the spectral and unmentionable nourishment which the colossal roots 3
must be sucking from that hoary, charnel earth; when my friend chided me for 3
such nonsense and told me that since no interments had occurred there for over a 3
century, nothing could possibly exist to nourish the tree in other than an 3
ordinary manner. Besides, he added, my constant talk about "unnamable" and 3
"unmentionable" things was a very puerile device, quite in keeping with my 3
lowly standing as an author. I was too fond of ending my stories with sights or 3
sounds which paralyzed my heroes' faculties and left them without courage, 3
words, or associations to tell what they had experienced. We know things, he 3
said, only through our five senses or our intuitions; wherefore it is quite 3
impossible to refer to any object or spectacle which cannot be clearly depicted by 3
the solid definitions of fact or the correct doctrines of theology - preferably those 3
of the Congregationalist, with whatever modifications tradition and Sir Arthur 3
Conan Doyle may supply. 3
3
With this friend, Joel Manton, I had often languidly disputed. He was principal 3
of the East High School, born and bred in Boston and sharing New England's 3
self-satisfied deafness to the delicate overtones of life. It was his view that only 3
our normal, objective experiences possess any esthetic significance, and that it is 3
the province of the artist not so much to rouse strong emotion by action, ecstasy, 3
and astonishment, as to maintain a placid interest and appreciation by accurate, 3
detailed transcripts of everyday affairs. Especially did he object to my 3
preoccupation with the mystical and the unexplained; for although believing in 3
the supernatural much more fully than I, he would not admit that it is 3
sufficiently commonplace for literary treatment. That a mind can find its greatest 3
pleasure in escapes from the daily treadmill, and in original and dramatic 3
recombinations of images usually thrown by habit and fatigue into the 3
hackneyed patterns of actual existence, was something virtually incredible to his 3
clear, practical, and logical intellect. With him all things and feelings had fixed 3
dimensions, properties, causes, and effects; and although he vaguely knew that 3
the mind sometimes holds visions and sensations of far less geometrical, 3
classifiable, and workable nature, he believed himself justified in drawing an 3
3
3
3
913 3
3
3
3
arbitrary line and ruling out of court all that cannot be experienced and 3
understood by the average citizen. Besides, he was almost sure that nothing can 3
be really "unnamable." It didn't sound sensible to him. 3
3
Though I well realized the futility of imaginative and metaphysical arguments 3
against the complacency of an orthodox sun-dweller, something in the scene of 3
this afternoon colloquy moved me to more than usual contentiousness. The 3
crumbling slate slabs, the patriarchal trees, and the centuried gambrel roofs of 3
the witch-haunted old town that stretched around, all combined to rouse my 3
spirit in defense of my work; and I was soon carrying my thrusts into the 3
enemy's own country. It was not, indeed, difficult to begin a counter-attack, for I 3
knew that Joel Manton actually half clung to many old-wives' superstitions 3
which sophisticated people had long outgrown; beliefs in the appearance of 3
dying persons at distant places, and in the impressions left by old faces on the 3
windows through which they had gazed all their lives. To credit these 3
whisperings of rural grandmothers, I now insisted, argued a faith in the existence 3
of spectral substances on the earth apart from and subsequent to their material 3
counterparts. It argued a capability of believing in phenomena beyond all normal 3
notions; for if a dead man can transmit his visible or tangible image half across 3
the world, or down the stretch of the centuries, how can it be absurd to suppose 3
that deserted houses are full of queer sentient things, or that old graveyards teem 3
with the terrible, unbodied intelligence of generations? And since spirit, in order 3
to cause all the manifestations attributed to it, cannot be limited by any of the 3
laws of matter, why is it extravagant to imagine psychically living dead things in 3
shapes - or absences of shapes - which must for human spectators be utterly and 3
appallingly "unnamable"? "Common sense" in reflecting on these subjects, I 3
assured my friend with some warmth, is merely a stupid absence of imagination 3
and mental flexibility. 3
3
Twilight had now approached, but neither of us felt any wish to cease speaking. 3
Manton seemed unimpressed by my arguments, and eager to refute them, 3
having that confidence in his own opinions which had doubtless caused his 3
success as a teacher; whilst I was too sure of my ground to fear defeat. The dusk 3
fell, and lights faintly gleamed in some of the distant windows, but we did not 3
move. Our seat on the tomb was very comfortable, and I knew that my prosaic 3
friend would not mind the cavernous rift in the ancient, root-disturbed 3
brickwork close behind us, or the utter blackness of the spot brought by the 3
intervention of a tottering, deserted seventeenth-century house between us and 3
the nearest lighted road. There in the dark, upon that riven tomb by the deserted 3
house, we talked on about the "unnamable" and after my friend had finished his 3
scoffing I told him of the awful evidence behind the story at which he had 3
scoffed the most. 3

My tale had been called The Attic Window, and appeared in the January, 1922, 3
issue of Whispers. In a good many places, especially the South and the Pacific 3
coast, they took the magazines off the stands at the complaints of silly milk-sops; 3
but New England didn't get the thrill and merely shrugged its shoulders at my 3
extravagance. The thing, it was averred, was biologically impossible to start with; 3
merely another of those crazy country mutterings which Cotton Mather had been 3
gullible enough to dump into his chaotic Magnalia Christi Americana, and so 3
poorly authenticated that even he had not ventured to name the locality where 3
the horror occurred. And as to the way I amplified the bare jotting of the old 3
mystic - that was quite impossible, and characteristic of a flighty and notional 3
scribbler! Mather had indeed told of the thing as being born, but nobody but a 3
cheap sensationalist would think of having it grow up, look into people's 3
windows at night, and be hidden in the attic of a house, in flesh and in spirit, till 3
someone saw it at the window centuries later and couldn't describe what it was 3
that turned his hair gray. All this was flagrant trashiness, and my friend Manton 3
was not slow to insist on that fact. Then I told him what I had found in an old 3
diary kept between 1706 and 1723, unearthed among family papers not a mile 3
from where we were sitting; that, and the certain reality of the scars on my 3
ancestor's chest and back which the diary described. I told him, too, of the fears 3
of others in that region, and how they were whispered down for generations; 3
and how no mythical madness came to the boy who in 1793 entered an 3
abandoned house to examine certain traces suspected to be there. 3
3
It had been an eldritch thing - no wonder sensitive students shudder at the 3
Puritan age in Massachusetts. So little is known of what went on beneath the 3
surface - so little, yet such a ghastly festering as it bubbles up putrescently in 3
occasional ghoulish glimpses. The witchcraft terror is a horrible ray of light on 3
what was stewing in men's crushed brains, but even that is a trifle. There was no 3
beauty; no freedom - we can see that from the architectural and household 3
remains, and the poisonous sermons of the cramped divines. And inside that 3
rusted iron straitjacket lurked gibbering hideousness, perversion, and diabolism. 3
Here, truly, was the apotheosis of The Unnamable. 3
3
Cotton Mather, in that demoniac sixth book which no one should read after dark, 3
minced no words as he flung forth his anathema. Stern as a Jewish prophet, and 3
laconically unamazed as none since his day could be, he told of the beast that 3
had brought forth what was more than beast but less than man - the thing with 3
the blemished eye - and of the screaming drunken wretch that hanged for having 3
such an eye. This much he baldly told, yet without a hint of what came after. 3
Perhaps he did not know, or perhaps he knew and did not dare to tell. Others 3
knew, but did not dare to tell - there is no public hint of why they whispered 3
about the lock on the door to the attic stairs in the house of a childless, broken. 3
3
3

3
3
3
embittered old man who had put up a blank slate slab by an avoided grave, 3
although one may trace enough evasive legends to curdle the thinnest blood. 3
3
It is all in that ancestral diary I found; all the hushed innuendoes and furtive 3
tales of things with a blemished eye seen at windows in the night or in deserted 3
meadows near the woods. Something had caught my ancestor on a dark valley 3
road, leaving him with marks of horns on his chest and of apelike claws on his 3
back; and when they looked for prints in the trampled dust they found the mixed 3
marks of split hooves and vaguely anthropoid paws. Once a post-rider said he 3
saw an old man chasing and calling to a frightful loping, nameless thing on 3
Meadow Hill in the thinly moonlit hours before dawn, and many believed him. 3
Certainly, there was strange talk one night in 1710 when the childless, broken old 3
man was buried in the crypt behind his own house in sight of the blank slate 3
slab. They never unlocked that attic door, but left the whole house as it was, 3
dreaded and deserted. When noises came from it, they whispered and shivered; 3
and hoped that the lock on that attic door was strong. Then they stopped hoping 3
when the horror occurred at the parsonage, leaving not a soul alive or in one 3
piece. With the years the legends take on a spectral character - I suppose the 3
thing, if it was a living thing, must have died. The memory had lingered 3
hideously - all the more hideous because it was so secret. 3
3
During this narration my friend Manton had become very silent, and I saw that 3
my words had impressed him. He did not laugh as I paused, but asked quite 3
seriously about the boy who went mad in 1793, and who had presumably been 3
the hero of my fiction. I told him why the boy had gone to that shunned, 3
deserted house, and remarked that he ought to be interested, since he believed 3
that windows retained latent images of those who had sat at them. The boy had 3
gone to look at the windows of that horrible attic, because of tales of things seen 3
behind them, and had come back screaming maniacally. 3
3
Manton remained thoughtful as I said this, but gradually reverted to his 3
analytical mood. He granted for the sake of argument that some unnatural 3
monster had really existed, but reminded me that even the most morbid 3
perversion of nature need not be unnamable or scientifically indescribable. I 3
admired his clearness and persistence, and added some further revelations I had 3
collected among the old people. Those later spectral legends, I made plain, 3
related to monstrous apparitions more frightful than anything organic could be; 3
apparitions of gigantic bestial forms sometimes visible and sometimes only 3
tangible, which floated about on moonless nights and haunted the old house, the 3
crypt behind it, and the grave where a sapling had sprouted beside an illegible 3
slab. Whether or not such apparitions had ever gored or smothered people to 3
death, as told in uncorroborated traditions, they had produced a strong and 3
consistent impression; and were yet darkly feared by very aged natives, though 3
3
3
3
916 3
3
3
3
largely forgotten by the last two generations - perhaps dying for lack of being 3
thought about. Moreover, so far as esthetic theory was involved, if the psychic 3
emanations of human creatures be grotesque distortions, what coherent 3
representation could express or portray so gibbous and infamous a nebulosity as 3
the specter of a malign, chaotic perversion, itself a morbid blasphemy against 3
nature? Molded by the dead brain of a hybrid nightmare, would not such a 3
vaporous terror constitute in all loathsome truth the exquisitely, the shriekingly 3
unnamable? 3
3
The hour must now have grown very late. A singularly noiseless bat brushed by 3
me, and I believe it touched Manton also, for although I could not see him I felt 3
him raise his arm. Presently he spoke. 3
3
"But is that house with the attic window still standing and deserted?" 3
3
"Yes," I answered, "I have seen it." 3
3
"And did you find anything there - in the attic or anywhere else?" 3
3
"There were some bones up under the eaves. They may have been what that boy 3
saw - if he was sensitive he wouldn't have needed anything in the window-glass 3
to unhinge him. If they all came from the same object it must have been an 3
hysterical, delirious monstrosity. It would have been blasphemous to leave such 3
bones in the world, so I went back with a sack and took them to the tomb behind 3
the house. There was an opening where I could dump them in. Don't think I was 3
a fool - you ought to have seen that skull. It had four-inch horns, but a face and 3
jaw something like yours and mine." 3
3
At last I could feel a real shiver run through Manton, who had moved very near. 3
But his curiosity was undeterred. 3
3
"And what about the window-panes?" 3
3
"They were all gone. One window had lost its entire frame, and in all the others 3
there was not a trace of glass in the little diamond apertures. They were that kind 3
- the old lattice windows that went out of use before 1700. 1 don't believe they've 3
had any glass for a hundred years or more - maybe the boy broke 'em if he got 3
that far; the legend doesn't say." 3
3
Manton was reflecting again. 3
3
"I'd like to see that house. Carter. Where is it? Glass or no glass, I must explore it 3
a little. And the tomb where you put those bones, and the other grave without an 3
inscription - the whole thing must be a bit terrible." 3
3
3
3
917 3
3
3
3
"You did see it - until it got dark." 3
3
My friend was more wrought upon than I had suspected, for at this touch of 3
harmless theatricalism he started neurotically away from me and actually cried 3
out with a sort of gulping gasp which released a strain of previous repression. It 3
was an odd cry, and all the more terrible because it was answered. For as it was 3
still echoing, I heard a creaking sound through the pitchy blackness, and knew 3
that a lattice window was opening in that accursed old house beside us. And 3
because all the other frames were long since fallen, I knew that it was the grisly 3
glassless frame of that demoniac attic window. 3
3
Then came a noxious rush of noisome, frigid air from that same dreaded 3
direction, followed by a piercing shriek just beside me on that shocking rifted 3
tomb of man and monster. In another instant I was knocked from my gruesome 3
bench by the devilish threshing of some unseen entity of titanic size but 3
undetermined nature; knocked sprawling on the root-clutched mold of that 3
abhorrent graveyard, while from the tomb came such a stifled uproar of gasping 3
and whirring that my fancy peopled the rayless gloom with Miltonic legions of 3
the misshapen damned. There was a vortex of withering, ice-cold wind, and then 3
the rattle of loose bricks and plaster; but I had mercifully fainted before I could 3
learn what it meant. 3
3
Manton, though smaller than I, is more resilient; for we opened our eyes at 3
almost the same instant, despite his greater injuries. Our couches were side by 3
side, and we knew in a few seconds that we were in St. Mary's Hospital. 3
Attendants were grouped about in tense curiosity, eager to aid our memory by 3
telling us how we came there, and we soon heard of the farmer who had found 3
us at noon in a lonely field beyond Meadow Hill, a mile from the old burying 3
ground, on a spot where an ancient slaughterhouse is reputed to have stood. 3
Manton had two malignant wounds in the chest, and some less severe cuts or 3
gougings in the back. I was not so seriously hurt, but was covered with welts and 3
contusions of the most bewildering character, including the print of a split hoof. 3
It was plain that Manton knew more than I, but he told nothing to the puzzled 3
and interested physicians till he had learned what our injuries were. Then he said 3
we were the victims of a vicious bull - though the animal was a difficult thing to 3
place and account for. 3
3
After the doctors and nurses had left, I whispered an awestruck question: 3
3
"Good God, Manton, but what was it? Those scars - was it like that?" 3
3
And I was too dazed to exult when he whispered back a thing I had half 3
expected - 3
3
3
3
918 3
3
3
3
"No - it wasn't that way at all. It was everywhere - a gelatin - a slime yet it had 3
shapes, a thousand shapes of horror beyond all memory. There were eyes - and a 3
blemish. It was the pit - the maelstrom - the ultimate abomination. Carter, it was 3
the unnamable! 3

The Very Old Folk 3
3
3
3
From a letter written to "Melmoth" (Donald Wandrei) on Thursday, November 3
3, 1927 3
3
It was a flaming sunset or late afternoon in the tiny provincial town of Pompelo, 3
at the foot of the Pyrenees in Hispania Citerior. The year must have been in the 3
late republic, for the province was still ruled by a senatorial proconsul instead of 3
a praetorian legate of Augustus, and the day was the first before the Kalends of 3
November. The hills rose scarlet and gold to the north of the little town, and the 3
westering sun shone ruddily and mystically on the crude new stone and plaster 3
buildings of the dusty forum and the wooden walls of the circus some distance to 3
the east. Groups of citizens - broad-browed Roman colonists and coarse-haired 3
Romanised natives, together with obvious hybrids of the two strains, alike clad 3
in cheap woollen togas - and sprinklings of helmeted legionaries and coarse- 3
mantled, black-bearded tribesmen of the circumambient Vascones - all thronged 3
the few paved streets and forum; moved by some vague and ill-defined 3
uneasiness. 3
3
I myself had just alighted from a litter, which the Illyrian bearers seemed to have 3
brought in some haste from Calagurris, across the Iberus to the southward. It 3
appeared that I was a provincial quaestor named L. Caelius Rufus, and that I had 3
been summoned by the proconsul, P. Scribonius Libo, who had come from 3
Tarraco some days before. The soldiers were the fifth cohort of the Xllth legion, 3
under the military tribune Sex. Asellius; and the legatus of the whole region, Cn. 3
Balbutius, had also come from Calagurris, where the permanent station was. 3
3
The cause of the conference was a horror that brooded on the hills. All the 3
townsfolk were frightened, and had begged the presence of a cohort from 3
Calagurris. It was the Terrible Season of the autumn, and the wild people in the 3
mountains were preparing for the frightful ceremonies which only rumour told 3
of in the towns. They were the very old folk who dwelt higher up in the hills and 3
spoke a choppy language which the Vascones could not understand. One seldom 3
saw them; but a few times a year they sent down little yellow, squint-eyed 3
messengers (who looked like Scythians) to trade with the merchants by means of 3
gestures, and every spring and autumn they held the infamous rites on the 3
peaks, their bowlings and altar-fires throwing terror into the villages. Always the 3
same - the night before the Kalends of Mains and the night before the Kalends of 3
November. Townsfolk would disappear just before these nights, and would 3
never be heard of again. And there were whispers that the native shepherds and 3
farmers were not ill-disposed toward the very old folk - that more than one 3
thatched hut was vacant before midnight on the two hideous Sabbaths. 3
3
3
3
920 3
3
3
3
This year the horror was very great, for the people knew that the wrath of the 3
very old folk was upon Pompelo. Three months previously five of the little 3
squint-eyed traders had come down from the hills, and in a market brawl three 3
of them had been killed. The remaining two had gone back wordlessly to their 3
mountains - and this autumn not a single villager had disappeared. There was 3
menace in this immunity. It was not like the very old folk to spare their victims at 3
the Sabbath. It was too good to be normal, and the villagers were afraid. 3
3
For many nights there had been a hollow drumming on the hills, and at last the 3
aedile Tib. Annaeus Stilpo (half native in blood) had sent to Balbutius at 3
Calagurris for a cohort to stamp out the Sabbath on the terrible night. Balbutius 3
had carelessly refused, on the ground that the villagers' fears were empty, and 3
that the loathsome rites of hill folk were of no concern to the Roman People 3
unless our own citizens were menaced. I, however, who seemed to be a close 3
friend of Balbutius, had disagreed with him; averring that I had studied deeply 3
in the black forbidden lore, and that I believed the very old folk capable of 3
visiting almost any nameless doom upon the town, which after all was a Roman 3
settlement and contained a great number of our citizens. The complaining 3
aedile's own mother Helvia was a pure Roman, the daughter of M. Helvius 3
Cinna, who had come over with Scipio's army. Accordingly I had sent a slave - a 3
nimble little Greek called Antipater - to the proconsul with letters, and 3
Scribonius had heeded my plea and ordered Balbutius to send his fifth cohort, 3
under Asellius, to Pompelo; entering the hills at dusk on the eve of November's 3
Kalends and stamping out whatever nameless orgies he might find - bringing 3
such prisoners as he might take to Tarraco for the next propraetor's court. 3
Balbutius, however, had protested, so that more correspondence had ensued. I 3
had written so much to the proconsul that he had become gravely interested, and 3
had resolved to make a personal inquiry into the horror. 3
3
He had at length proceeded to Pompelo with his lictors and attendants; there 3
hearing enough rumours to be greatly impressed and disturbed, and standing 3
firmly by his order for the Sabbath's extirpation. Desirous of conferring with one 3
who had studied the subject, he ordered me to accompany Asellius' cohort - and 3
Balbutius had also come along to press his adverse advice, for he honestly 3
believed that drastic military action would stir up a dangerous sentiment of 3
unrest amongst the Vascones both tribal and settled. 3
3
So here we all were in the mystic sunset of the autumn hills - old Scribonius Libo 3
in his toga praetexta, the golden light glancing on his shiny bald head and 3
wrinkled hawk face, Balbutius with his gleaming helmet and breastplate, blue- 3
shaven lips compressed in conscientiously dogged opposition, young Asellius 3
with his polished greaves and superior sneer, and the curious throng of 3
townsfolk, legionaries, tribesmen, peasants, lictors, slaves, and attendants. I 3
3
3
3
921 3
3
3
3
myself seemed to wear a common toga, and to have no especially distinguishing 3
characteristic. And everywhere horror brooded. The town and country folk 3
scarcely dared speak aloud, and the men of Libo's entourage, who had been 3
there nearly a week, seemed to have caught something of the nameless dread. 3
Old Scribonius himself looked very grave, and the sharp voices of us later 3
comers seemed to hold something of curious inappropriateness, as in a place of 3
death or the temple of some mystic god. 3
3
We entered the praetorium and held grave converse. Balbutius pressed his 3
objections, and was sustained by Asellius, who appeared to hold all the natives 3
in extreme contempt while at the same time deeming it inadvisable to excite 3
them. Both soldiers maintained that we could better afford to antagonise the 3
minority of colonists and civilised natives by inaction, than to antagonise a 3
probable majority of tribesmen and cottagers by stamping out the dread rites. 3
3
I, on the other hand, renewed my demand for action, and offered to accompany 3
the cohort on any expedition it might undertake. I pointed out that the barbarous 3
Vascones were at best turbulent and uncertain, so that skirmishes with them 3
were inevitable sooner or later whichever course we might take; that they had 3
not in the past proved dangerous adversaries to our legions, and that it would ill 3
become the representatives of the Roman People to suffer barbarians to interfere 3
with a course which the justice and prestige of the Republic demanded. That, on 3
the other hand, the successful administration of a province depended primarily 3
upon the safety and good-will of the civilised element in whose hands the local 3
machinery of commerce and prosperity reposed, and in whose veins a large 3
mixture of our own Italian blood coursed. These, though in numbers they might 3
form a minority, were the stable element whose constancy might be relied on, 3
and whose cooperation would most firmly bind the province to the Imperium of 3
the Senate and the Roman People. It was at once a duty and an advantage to 3
afford them the protection due to Roman citizens; even (and here I shot a 3
sarcastic look at Balbutius and Asellius) at the expense of a little trouble and 3
activity, and of a slight interruption of the draught-playing and cock- fighting at 3
the camp in Calagurris. That the danger to the town and inhabitants of Pompelo 3
was a real one, I could not from my studies doubt. I had read many scrolls out of 3
Syria and ^gyptus, and the cryptic towns of Etruria, and had talked at length 3
with the bloodthirsty priest of Diana Aricina in his temple in the woods 3
bordering Lacus Nemorensis. There were shocking dooms that might be called 3
out of the hills on the Sabbaths; dooms which ought not to exist within the 3
territories of the Roman People; and to permit orgies of the kind known to 3
prevail at Sabbaths would be but little in consonance with the customs of those 3
whose forefathers, A. Postumius being consul, had executed so many Roman 3
citizens for the practice of the Bacchanalia - a matter kept ever in memory by the 3
Senatus Consultum de Bacchanalibus, graven upon bronze and set open to every 3
3
3
3
922 3
3
3
3
eye. Checked in time, before the progress of the rites might evoke anything with 3
which the iron of a Roman pilum might not be able to deal, the Sabbath would 3
not be too much for the powers of a single cohort. Only participants need be 3
apprehended, and the sparing of a great number of mere spectators would 3
considerably lessen the resentment which any of the sympathising country folk 3
might feel. In short, both principle and policy demanded stern action; and I could 3
not doubt but that Publius Scribonius, bearing in mind the dignity and 3
obligations of the Roman People, would adhere to his plan of despatching the 3
cohort, me accompanying, despite such objections as Balbutius and Asellius - 3
speaking indeed more like provincials than Romans - might see fit to offer and 3
multiply. 3
3
The slanting sun was now very low, and the whole hushed town seemed draped 3
in an unreal and malign glamour. Then P. Scribonius the proconsul signified his 3
approval of my words, and stationed me with the cohort in the provisional 3
capacity of a centurio primipilus; Balbutius and Asellius assenting, the former 3
with better grace than the latter. As twilight fell on the wild autumnal slopes, a 3
measured, hideous beating of strange drums floated down from afar in terrible 3
rhythm. Some few of the legionarii shewed timidity, but sharp commands 3
brought them into line, and the whole cohort was soon drawn up on the open 3
plain east of the circus. Libo himself, as well as Balbutius, insisted on 3
accompanying the cohort; but great difficulty was suffered in getting a native 3
guide to point out the paths up the mountain. Finally a young man named 3
Vercellius, the son of pure Roman parents, agreed to take us at least past the 3
foothills. We began to march in the new dusk, with the thin silver sickle of a 3
young moon trembling over the woods on our left. That which disquieted us 3
most was the fact that the Sabbath was to be held at all. Reports of the coming 3
cohort must have reached the hills, and even the lack of a final decision could not 3
make the rumour less alarming - yet there were the sinister drums as of yore, as 3
if the celebrants had some peculiar reason to be indifferent whether or not the 3
forces of the Roman People marched against them. The sound grew louder as we 3
entered a rising gap in the hills, steep wooded banks enclosing us narrowly on 3
either side, and displaying curiously fantastic tree-trunks in the light of our 3
bobbing torches. All were afoot save Libo, Balbutius, Asellius, two or three of the 3
centuriones, and myself, and at length the way became so steep and narrow that 3
those who had horses were forced to leave them; a squad of ten men being left to 3
guard them, though robber bands were not likely to be abroad on such a night of 3
terror. Once in a while it seemed as though we detected a skulking form in the 3
woods nearby, and after a half- hour's climb the steepness and narrowness of the 3
way made the advance of so great a body of men - over 300, all told - exceedingly 3
cumbrous and difficult. Then with utter and horrifying suddenness we heard a 3
frightful sound from below. It was from the tethered horses - they had screamed, 3
not neighed, but screamed... and there was no light down there, nor the sound 3
3
3
3
923 3
3
3
3
of any human thing, to shew why they had done so. At the same moment 3
bonfires blazed out on all the peaks ahead, so that terror seemed to lurk equally 3
well before and behind us. Looking for the youth Vercellius, our guide, we found 3
only a crumpled heap weltering in a pool of blood. In his hand was a short 3
sword snatched from the belt of D. Vibulanus, a subcenturio, and on his face was 3
such a look of terror that the stoutest veterans turned pale at the sight. He had 3
killed himself when the horses screamed... he, who had been born and lived all 3
his life in that region, and knew what men whispered about the hills. All the 3
torches now began to dim, and the cries of frightened legionaries mingled with 3
the unceasing screams of the tethered horses. The air grew perceptibly colder, 3
more suddenly so than is usual at November's brink, and seemed stirred by 3
terrible undulations which I could not help connecting with the beating of huge 3
wings. The whole cohort now remained at a standstill, and as the torches faded I 3
watched what I thought were fantastic shadows outlined in the sky by the 3
spectral luminosity of the Via Lactea as it flowed through Perseus, Cassiopeia, 3
Cepheus, and Cygnus. Then suddenly all the stars were blotted from the sky - 3
even bright Deneb and Vega ahead, and the lone Altair and Fomalhaut behind 3
us. And as the torches died out altogether, there remained above the stricken and 3
shrieking cohort only the noxious and horrible altar-flames on the towering 3
peaks; hellish and red, and now silhouetting the mad, leaping, and colossal 3
forms of such nameless beasts as had never a Phrygian priest or Campanian 3
grandam whispered of in the wildest of furtive tales. And above the nighted 3
screaming of men and horses that daemonic drumming rose to louder pitch, 3
whilst an ice-cold wind of shocking sentience and deliberateness swept down 3
from those forbidden heights and coiled about each man separately, till all the 3
cohort was struggling and screaming in the dark, as if acting out the fate of 3
Laocoon and his sons. Only old Scribonius Libo seemed resigned. He uttered 3
words amidst the screaming, and they echo still in my ears. "Malitia vetus - 3
malitia vetus est . . . venit . . . tandem venit ..." 3
3
And then I waked. It was the most vivid dream in years, drawing upon wells of 3
the subconscious long untouched and forgotten. Of the fate of that cohort no 3
record exists, but the town at least was saved - for encyclopaedias tell of the 3
survival of Pompelo to this day, under the modern Spanish name of 3
Pompelona... 3

Bear in mind closely that I did not see any actual visual horror at the end. To say 3
that a mental shock was the cause of what I inferred - that last straw which sent 3
me racing out of the lonely Akeley farmhouse and through the wild domed hills 3
of Vermont in a commandeered motor at night - is to ignore the plainest facts of 3
my final experience. Notwithstanding the deep things I saw and heard, and the 3
admitted vividness the impression produced on me by these things, I cannot 3
prove even now whether I was right or wrong in my hideous inference. For after 3
all Akeley's disappearance establishes nothing. People found nothing amiss in 3
his house despite the bullet-marks on the outside and inside. It was just as 3
though he had walked out casually for a ramble in the hills and failed to return. 3
There was not even a sign that a guest had been there, or that those horrible 3
cylinders and machines had been stored in the study. That he had mortally 3
feared the crowded green hills and endless trickle of brooks among which he had 3
been born and reared, means nothing at all, either; for thousands are subject to 3
just such morbid fears. Eccentricity, moreover, could easily account for his 3
strange acts and apprehensions toward the last. 3
3
The whole matter began, so far as I am concerned, with the historic and 3
unprecedented Vermont floods of November 3, 1927. I was then, as now, an 3
instructor of literature at Miskatonic University in Arkham, Massachusetts, and 3
an enthusiastic amateur student of New England folklore. Shortly after the flood, 3
amidst the varied reports of hardship, suffering, and organized relief which filled 3
the press, there appeared certain odd stories of things found floating in some of 3
the swollen rivers; so that many of my friends embarked on curious discussions 3
and appealed to me to shed what light I could on the subject. I felt flattered at 3
having my folklore study taken so seriously, and did what I could to belittle the 3
wild, vague tales which seemed so clearly an outgrowth of old rustic 3
superstitions. It amused me to find several persons of education who insisted 3
that some stratum of obscure, distorted fact might underlie the rumors. 3
3
The tales thus brought to my notice came mostly through newspaper cuttings; 3
though one yarn had an oral source and was repeated to a friend of mine in a 3
letter from his mother in Hardwick, Vermont. The type of thing described was 3
essentially the same in all cases, though there seemed to be three separate 3
3
3
3
925 3
3
3
3
instances involved - one connected with the Winooski River near Montpeher, 3
another attached to the West River in Windham County beyond Newfane, and a 3
third centering in the Passumpsic in Caledonia County above Lyndonville. Of 3
course many of the stray items mentioned other instances, but on analysis they 3
all seemed to boil down to these three. In each case country folk reported seeing 3
one or more very bizarre and disturbing objects in the surging waters that 3
poured down from the unfrequented hills, and there was a widespread tendency 3
to connect these sights with a primitive, half-forgotten cycle of whispered legend 3
which old people resurrected for the occasion. 3

What people thought they saw were organic shapes not quite like any they had 3
ever seen before. Naturally, there were many human bodies washed along by the 3
streams in that tragic period; but those who described these strange shapes felt 3
quite sure that they were not human, despite some superficial resemblances in 3
size and general outline. Nor, said the witnesses, could they have been any kind 3
of animal known to Vermont. They were pinkish things about five feet long; with 3
crustaceous bodies bearing vast pairs of dorsal fins or membranous wings and 3
several sets of articulated limbs, and with a sort of convoluted ellipsoid, covered 3
with multitudes of very short antennae, where a head would ordinarily be. It 3
was really remarkable how closely the reports from different sources tended to 3
coincide; though the wonder was lessened by the fact that the old legends, 3
shared at one time throughout the hill country, furnished a morbidly vivid 3
picture which might well have coloured the imaginations of all the witnesses 3
concerned. It was my conclusion that such witnesses - in every case naive and 3
simple backwoods folk - had glimpsed the battered and bloated bodies of human 3
beings or farm animals in the whirling currents; and had allowed the half- 3
remembered folklore to invest these pitiful objects with fantastic attributes. 3
3
The ancient folklore, while cloudy, evasive, and largely forgotten by the present 3
generation, was of a highly singular character, and obviously reflected the 3
influence of still earlier Indian tales. I knew it well, though I had never been in 3
Vermont, through the exceedingly rare monograph of Eli Davenport, which 3
embraces material orally obtained prior to 1839 among the oldest people of the 3
state. This material, moreover, closely coincided with tales which I had 3
personally heard from elderly rustics in the mountains of New Hampshire. 3
Briefly summarized, it hinted at a hidden race of monstrous beings which lurked 3
somewhere among the remoter hills - in the deep woods of the highest peaks, 3
and the dark valleys where streams trickle from unknown sources. These beings 3
were seldom glimpsed, but evidences of their presence were reported by those 3
who had ventured farther than usual up the slopes of certain mountains or into 3
certain deep, steep-sided gorges that even the wolves shunned. 3
3

3
There were queer footprints or claw-prints in the mud of brook-margins and 3
barren patches, and curious circles of stones, with the grass around them worn 3
away, which did not seem to have been placed or entirely shaped by Nature. 3
There were, too, certain caves of problematical depth in the sides of the hills; 3
with mouths closed by boulders in a manner scarcely accidental, and with more 3
than an average quota of the queer prints leading both toward and away from 3
them - if indeed the direction of these prints could be justly estimated. And worst 3
of all, there were the things which adventurous people had seen very rarely in 3
the twilight of the remotest valleys and the dense perpendicular woods above 3
the limits of normal hill- climbing. 3
3
It would have been less uncomfortable if the stray accounts of these things had 3
not agreed so well. As it was, nearly all the rumors had several points in 3
common; averring that the creatures were a sort of huge, light-red crab with 3
many pairs of legs and with two great batlike wings in the middle of the back. 3
They sometimes walked on all their legs, and sometimes on the hindmost pair 3
only, using the others to convey large objects of indeterminate nature. On one 3
occasion they were spied in considerable numbers, a detachment of them wading 3
along a shallow woodland watercourse three abreast in evidently disciplined 3
formation. Once a specimen was seen flying - launching itself from the top of a 3
bald, lonely hill at night and vanishing in the sky after its great flapping wings 3
had been silhouetted an instant against the full moon 3
3
These things seemed content, on the whole, to let mankind alone; though they 3
were at times held responsible for the disappearance of venturesome individuals 3
- especially persons who built houses too close to certain valleys or too high up 3
on certain mountains. Many localities came to be known as inadvisable to settle 3
in, the feeling persisting long after the cause was forgotten. People would look 3
up at some of the neighbouring mountain-precipices with a shudder, even when 3
not recalling how many settlers had been lost, and how many farmhouses burnt 3
to ashes, on the lower slopes of those grim, green sentinels. 3
3
But while according to the earliest legends the creatures would appear to have 3
harmed only those trespassing on their privacy; there were later accounts of their 3
curiosity respecting men, and of their attempts to establish secret outposts in the 3
human world. There were tales of the queer claw-prints seen around farmhouse 3
windows in the morning, and of occasional disappearances in regions outside the 3
obviously haunted areas. Tales, besides, of buzzing voices in imitation of human 3
speech which made surprising offers to lone travelers on roads and cart-paths in 3
the deep woods, and of children frightened out of their wits by things seen or 3
heard where the primal forest pressed close upon their door-yards. In the final 3
layer of legends - the layer just preceding the decline of superstition and the 3
abandonment of close contact with the dreaded places - there are shocked 3
3
3
3
927 3
3
3
3
references to hermits and remote farmers who at some period of Hfe appeared to 3
have undergone a repellent mental change, and who were shunned and 3
whispered about as mortals who had sold themselves to the strange beings. In 3
one of the northeastern counties it seemed to be a fashion about 1800 to accuse 3
eccentric and unpopular recluses of being allies or representatives of the 3
abhorred things. 3
3
As to what the things were - explanations naturally varied. The common name 3
applied to them was "those ones/' or "the old ones/' though other terms had a 3
local and transient use. Perhaps the bulk of the Puritan settlers set them down 3
bluntly as familiars of the devil, and made them a basis of awed theological 3
speculation. Those with Celtic legendry in their heritage - mainly the Scotch-Irish 3
element of New Hampshire, and their kindred who had settled in Vermont on 3
Governor Wentworth's colonial grants - linked them vaguely with the malign 3
fairies and "little people" of the bogs and raths, and protected themselves with 3
scraps of incantation handed down through many generations. But the Indians 3
had the most fantastic theories of all. While different tribal legends differed, 3
there was a marked consensus of belief in certain vital particulars; it being 3
unanimously agreed that the creatures were not native to this earth. 3
3
The Pennacook myths, which were the most consistent and picturesque, taught 3
that the Winged Ones came from the Great Bear in the sky, and had mines in our 3
earthly hills whence they took a kind of stone they could not get on any other 3
world. They did not live here, said the myths, but merely maintained outposts 3
and flew back with vast cargoes of stone to their own stars in the north. They 3
harmed only those earth-people who got too near them or spied upon them. 3
Animals shunned them through instinctive hatred, not because of being hunted. 3
They could not eat the things and animals of earth, but brought their own food 3
from the stars. It was bad to get near them, and sometimes young hunters who 3
went into their hills never came back. It was not good, either, to listen to what 3
they whispered at night in the forest with voices like a bee's that tried to be like 3
the voices of men. They knew the speech of all kinds of men - Pennacooks, 3
Hurons, men of the Five Nations - but did not seem to have or need any speech 3
of their own. They talked with their heads, which changed colour in different 3
ways to mean different things. 3
3
All the legendry, of course, white and Indian alike, died down during the 3
nineteenth century, except for occasional atavistical flareups. The ways of the 3
Vermonters became settled; and once their habitual paths and dwellings were 3
established according to a certain fixed plan, they remembered less and less what 3
fears and avoidances had determined that plan, and even that there had been 3
any fears or avoidances. Most people simply knew that certain hilly regions were 3
considered as highly unhealthy, unprofitable, and generally unlucky to live in. 3
3
3
3
928 3
3
3
3
and that the farther one kept from them the better off one usually was. In time 3
the ruts of custom and economic interest became so deeply cut in approved 3
places that there was no longer any reason for going outside them, and the 3
haunted hills were left deserted by accident rather than by design. Save during 3
infrequent local scares, only wonder-loving grandmothers and retrospective 3
nonagenarians ever whispered of beings dwelling in those hills; and even such 3
whispers admitted that there was not much to fear from those things now that 3
they were used to the presence of houses and settlements, and now that human 3
beings let their chosen territory severely alone. 3
3
All this I had long known from my reading, and from certain folk tales picked up 3
in New Hampshire; hence when the flood-time rumours began to appear, I could 3
easily guess what imaginative background had evolved them. I took great pains 3
to explain this to my friends, and was correspondingly amused when several 3
contentious souls continued to insist on a possible element of truth in the reports. 3
Such persons tried to point out that the early legends had a significant 3
persistence and uniformity, and that the virtually unexplored nature of the 3
Vermont hills made it unwise to be dogmatic about what might or might not 3
dwell among them; nor could they be silenced by my assurance that all the 3
myths were of a well-known pattern common to most of mankind and 3
determined by early phases of imaginative experience which always produced 3
the same type of delusion. 3
3
It was of no use to demonstrate to such opponents that the Vermont myths 3
differed but little in essence from those universal legends of natural 3
personification which filled the ancient world with fauns and dryads and satyrs, 3
suggested the kallikanzarai of modern Greece, and gave to wild Wales and 3
Ireland their dark hints of strange, small, and terrible hidden races of troglodytes 3
and burrowers. No use, either, to point out the even more startlingly similar 3
belief of the Nepalese hill tribes in the dreaded Mi-Go or "Abominable Snow- 3
Men" who lurk hideously amidst the ice and rock pinnacles of the Himalayan 3
summits. When I brought up this evidence, my opponents turned it against me 3
by claiming that it must imply some actual historicity for the ancient tales; that it 3
must argue the real existence of some queer elder earth-race, driven to hiding 3
after the advent and dominance of mankind, which might very conceivably have 3
survived in reduced numbers to relatively recent times - or even to the present. 3
3
The more I laughed at such theories, the more these stubborn friends asseverated 3
them; adding that even without the heritage of legend the recent reports were 3
too clear, consistent, detailed, and sanely prosaic in manner of telling, to be 3
completely ignored. Two or three fanatical extremists went so far as to hint at 3
possible meanings in the ancient Indian tales which gave the hidden beings a 3
nonterrestrial origin; citing the extravagant books of Charles Fort with their 3
3
3
3
929 3
3
3
3
claims that voyagers from other worlds and outer space have often visited the 3
earth. Most of my foes, however, were merely romanticists who insisted on 3
trying to transfer to real life the fantastic lore of lurking "little people" made 3
popular by the magnificent horror- fiction of Arthur Machen. 3
3
II 3
3
As was only natural under the circumstances, this piquant debating finally got 3
into print in the form of letters to the Arkham Advertiser; some of which were 3
copied in the press of those Vermont regions whence the flood-stories came. The 3
Rutland Herald gave half a page of extracts from the letters on both sides, while 3
the Brattleboro Reformer reprinted one of my long historical and mythological 3
summaries in full, with some accompanying comments in "The Pendrifter's" 3
thoughtful column which supported and applauded my skeptical conclusions. 3
By the spring of 1928 I was almost a well-known figure in Vermont, 3
notwithstanding the fact that I had never set foot in the state. Then came the 3
challenging letters from Henry Akeley which impressed me so profoundly, and 3
which took me for the first and last time to that fascinating realm of crowded 3
green precipices and muttering forest streams. 3
3
Most of what I know of Henry Wentworth Akeley was gathered by 3
correspondence with his neighbours, and with his only son in California, after 3
my experience in his lonely farmhouse. He was, I discovered, the last 3
representative on his home soil of a long, locally distinguished line of jurists, 3
administrators, and gentlemen-agriculturists. In him, however, the family 3
mentally had veered away from practical affairs to pure scholarship; so that he 3
had been a notable student of mathematics, astronomy, biology, anthropology, 3
and folklore at the University of Vermont. I had never previously heard of him, 3
and he did not give many autobiographical details in his communications; but 3
from the first I saw he was a man of character, education, and intelligence, albeit 3
a recluse with very little worldly sophistication. 3
3
Despite the incredible nature of what he claimed, I could not help at once taking 3
Akeley more seriously than I had taken any of the other challengers of my views. 3
For one thing, he was really close to the actual phenomena - visible and tangible - 3
that he speculated so grotesquely about; and for another thing, he was amazingly 3
willing to leave his conclusions in a tenative state like a true man of science. He 3
had no personal preferences to advance, and was always guided by what he took 3
to be solid evidence. Of course I began by considering him mistaken, but gave 3
him credit for being intelligently mistaken; and at no time did I emulate some of 3
his friends in attributing his ideas, and his fear of the lonely green hills, to 3
insanity. I could see that there was a great deal to the man, and knew that what 3
he reported must surely come from strange circumstance deserving 3
3
3
3
930 3
3
3
3
investigation, however little it might have to do with the fantastic causes he 3
assigned. Later on I received from him certain material proofs which placed the 3
matter on a somewhat different and bewilderingly bizarre basis. 3
3
I cannot do better than transcribe in full, so far as is possible, the long letter in 3
which Akeley introduced himself, and which formed such an important 3
landmark in my own intellectual history. It is no longer in my possession, but my 3
memory holds almost every word of its portentous message; and again I affirm 3
my confidence in the sanity of the man who wrote it. Here is the text - a text 3
which reached me in the cramped, archaic-looking scrawl of one who had 3
obviously not mingled much with the world during his sedate, scholarly life. 3

My Dear Sir: 3
3
3
3
3
3
3
3
I have read with great interest the Brattleboro Reformer's reprint (Apr. 23, '28) of 3
your letter on the recent stories of strange bodies seen floating in our flooded 3
streams last fall, and on the curious folklore they so well agree with. It is easy to 3
see why an outlander would take the position you take, and even why 3
"Pendrifter" agrees with you. That is the attitude generally taken by educated 3
persons both in and out of Vermont, and was my own attitude as a young man (I 3
am now b7) before my studies, both general and in Davenport's book, led me to 3
do some exploring in parts of the hills hereabouts not usually visited. 3
3
I was directed toward such studies by the queer old tales I used to hear from 3
elderly farmers of the more ignorant sort, but now I wish I had let the whole 3
matter alone. I might say, with all proper modesty, that the subject of 3
anthropology and folklore is by no means strange to me. I took a good deal of it 3
at college, and am familiar with most of the standard authorities such as Tylor, 3
Lubbock, Frazer, Quatrefages, Murray, Osborn, Keith, Boule, G. Elliott Smith, 3
and so on. It is no news to me that tales of hidden races are as old as all mankind. 3
I have seen the reprints of letters from you, and those agreeing with you, in the 3
Rutland Herald, and guess I know about where your controversy stands at the 3
present time. 3
3
3
3
931 3
3
3
3
What I desire to say now is, that I am afraid your adversaries are nearer right 3
than yourself, even though all reason seems to be on your side. They are nearer 3
right than they realise themselves - for of course they go only by theory, and 3
cannot know what I know. If I knew as little of the matter as they, I would feel 3
justified in believing as they do. I would be wholly on your side. 3
3
You can see that I am having a hard time getting to the point, probably because I 3
really dread getting to the point; but the upshot of the matter is that I have 3
certain evidence that monstrous things do indeed live in the woods on the high 3
hills which nobody visits. I have not seen any of the things floating in the rivers, 3
as reported, but I have seen things like them under circumstances I dread to 3
repeat. I have seen footprints, and of late have seen them nearer my own home (I 3
live in the old Akeley place south of Townshend Village, on the side of Dark 3
Mountain) than I dare tell you now. And I have overheard voices in the woods at 3
certain points that I will not even begin to describe on paper. 3
3
At one place I heard them so much that I took a phonograph therewith a 3
dictaphone attachment and wax blank - and I shall try to arrange to have you 3
hear the record I got. I have run it on the machine for some of the old people up 3
here, and one of the voices had nearly scared them paralysed by reason of its 3
likeness to a certain voice (that buzzing voice in the woods which Davenport 3
mentions) that their grandmothers have told about and mimicked for them. I 3
know what most people think of a man who tells about "hearing voices" - but 3
before you draw conclusions just listen to this record and ask some of the older 3
backwoods people what they think of it. If you can account for it normally, very 3
well; but there must be something behind it. Ex nihilo nihil fit, you know. 3
3
Now my object in writing you is not to start an argument but to give you 3
information which I think a man of your tastes will find deeply interesting. This 3
is private. Publicly I am on your side, for certain things show me that it does not 3
do for people to know too much about these matters. My own studies are now 3
wholly private, and I would not think of saying anything to attract people's 3
attention and cause them to visit the places I have explored. It is true - terribly 3
true - that there are non-human creatures watching us all the time; with spies 3
among us gathering information. It is from a wretched man who, if he was sane 3
(as I think he was) was one of those spies, that I got a large part of my clues to 3
the matter. He later killed himself, but I have reason to think there are others 3
now. 3
3
The things come from another planet, being able to live in interstellar space and 3
fly through it on clumsy, powerful wings which have a way of resisting the 3
aether but which are too poor at steering to be of much use in helping them 3
about on earth. I will tell you about this later if you do not dismiss me at once as 3
3
3
3
932 3
3
3
3
a madman. They come here to get metals from mines that go deep under the 3
hills, and I think I know where they come from. They will not hurt us if we let 3
them alone, but no one can say what will happen if we get too curious about 3
them. Of course a good army of men could wipe out their mining colony. That is 3
what they are afraid of. But if that happened, more would come from outside - 3
any number of them. They could easily conquer the earth, but have not tried so 3
far because they have not needed to. They would rather leave things as they are 3
to save bother. 3
3
I think they mean to get rid of me because of what I have discovered. There is a 3
great black stone with unknown hieroglyphics half worn away which I found in 3
the woods on Round Hill, east of here; and after I took it home everything 3
became different. If they think I suspect too much they will either kill me or take 3
me off the earth to where they come from. They like to take away men of 3
learning once in a while, to keep informed on the state of things in the human 3
world. 3
3
This leads me to my secondary purpose in addressing you - namely, to urge you 3
to hush up the present debate rather than give it more publicity. People must be 3
kept away from these hills, and in order to effect this, their curiosity ought not to 3
be aroused any further. Heaven knows there is peril enough anyway, with 3
promoters and real estate men flooding Vermont with herds of summer people 3
to overrun the wild places and cover the hills with cheap bungalows. 3
3
I shall welcome further communication with you, and shall try to send you that 3
phonograph record and black stone (which is so worn that photographs don't 3
show much) by express if you are willing. I say "try" because I think those 3
creatures have a way of tampering with things around here. There is a sullen 3
furtive fellow named Brown, on a farm near the village, who I think is their spy. 3
Little by little they are trying to cut me off from our world because I know too 3
much about their world. 3
3
They have the most amazing way of finding out what I do. You may not even get 3
this letter. I think I shall have to leave this part of the country and go live with 3
my son in San Diego, Cal., if things get any worse, but it is not easy to give up 3
the place you were born in, and where your family has lived for six generations. 3
Also, I would hardly dare sell this house to anybody now that the creatures have 3
taken notice of it. They seem to be trying to get the black stone back and destroy 3
the phonograph record, but I shall not let them if I can help it. My great police 3
dogs always hold them back, for there are very few here as yet, and they are 3
clumsy in getting about. As I have said, their wings are not much use for short 3
flights on earth. I am on the very brink of deciphering that stone - in a very 3
terrible way - and with your knowledge of folklore you may be able to supply 3
3
3
3
933 3
3
3
3
the missing links enough to help me. I suppose you know all about the fearful 3
myths antedating the coming of man to the earth - the Yog-Sothoth and Cthulhu 3
cycles - which are hinted at in the Necronomicon. I had access to a copy of that 3
once, and hear that you have one in your college library under lock and key. 3
3
To conclude, Mr. Wilmarth, I think that with our respective studies we can be 3
very useful to each other. I don't wish to put you in any peril, and suppose I 3
ought to warn you that possession of the stone and the record won't be very safe; 3
but I think you will find any risks worth running for the sake of knowledge. I 3
will drive down to Newfane or Brattleboro to send whatever you authorize me to 3
send, for the express offices there are more to be trusted. I might say that I live 3
quite alone now, since I can't keep hired help any more. They won't stay because 3
of the things that try to get near the house at night, and that keep the dogs 3
barking continually. I am glad I didn't get as deep as this into the business while 3
my wife was alive, for it would have driven her mad. 3
3
Hoping that I am not bothering you unduly, and that you will decide to get in 3
touch with me rather than 3
3
throw this letter into the waste basket as a madman's raving, I am 3
3
Yrs. very truly, 3
3
Henry W. Akeley 3
3
P.S. I am making some extra prints of certain photographs taken by me, which I 3
think will help to prove a number of the points I have touched on. The old 3
people think they are monstrously true. I shall send you these very soon if you 3
are interested. 3
3

3
It would be difficult to describe my sentiments upon reading this strange 3
document for the first time. By all ordinary rules, I ought to have laughed more 3
loudly at these extravagances than at the far milder theories which had 3
previously moved me to mirth; yet something in the tone of the letter made me 3
take it with paradoxical seriousness. Not that I believed for a moment in the 3
hidden race from the stars which my correspondent spoke of; but that, after some 3
grave preliminary doubts, I grew to feel oddly sure of his sanity and sincerity, 3
and of his confrontation by some genuine though singular and abnormal 3
phenomenon which he could not explain except in this imaginative way. It could 3
not be as he thought it, I reflected, yet on the other hand, it could not be 3
otherwise than worthy of investigation. The man seemed unduly excited and 3
alarmed about something, but it was hard to think that all cause was lacking. He 3
3
3
3
934 3
3
3
3
was so specific and logical in certain ways - and after all, his yarn did fit in so 3
perplexingly well with some of the old myths - even the wildest Indian legends. 3
3
That he had really overheard disturbing voices in the hills, and had really found 3
the black stone he spoke about, was wholly possible despite the crazy inferences 3
he had made - inferences probably suggested by the man who had claimed to be 3
a spy of the outer beings and had later killed himself. It was easy to deduce that 3
this man must have been wholly insane, but that he probably had a streak of 3
perverse outward logic which made the naive Akeley - already prepared for such 3
things by his folklore studies - believe his tale. As for the latest developments - it 3
appeared from his inability to keep hired help that Akeley's humbler rustic 3
neighbours were as convinced as he that his house was besieged by uncanny 3
things at night. The dogs really barked, too. 3
3
And then the matter of that phonograph record, which I could not but believe he 3
had obtained in the way he said. It must mean something; whether animal noises 3
deceptively like human speech, or the speech of some hidden, night-haunting 3
human being decayed to a state not much above that of lower animals. From this 3
my thoughts went back to the black hieroglyphed stone, and to speculations 3
upon what it might mean. Then, too, what of the photographs which Akeley said 3
he was about to send, and which the old people had found so convincingly 3
terrible? 3
3
As I re-read the cramped handwriting I felt as never before that my credulous 3
opponents might have more on their side than I had conceded. After all, there 3
might be some queer and perhaps hereditarily misshapen outcasts in those 3
shunned hills, even though no such race of star-born monsters as folklore 3
claimed. And if there were, then the presence of strange bodies in the flooded 3
streams would not be wholly beyond belief. Was it too presumptuous to suppose 3
that both the old legends and the recent reports had this much of reality behind 3
them? But even as I harboured these doubts I felt ashamed that so fantastic a 3
piece of bizarrerie as Henry Akeley's wild letter had brought them up. 3
3
In the end I answered Akeley's letter, adopting a tone of friendly interest and 3
soliciting further particulars. His reply came almost by return mail; and 3
contained, true to promise, a number of Kodak views of scenes and objects 3
illustrating what he had to tell. Glancing at these pictures as I took them from the 3
envelope, I felt a curious sense of fright and nearness to forbidden things; for in 3
spite of the vagueness of most of them, they had a damnably suggestive power 3
which was intensified by the fact of their being genuine photographs - actual 3
optical links with what they portrayed, and the product of an impersonal 3
transmitting process without prejudice, fallibility, or mendacity. 3
3
3
3
935 3
3
3
3
The more I looked at them, the more I saw that my senous estimate of Akeley 3
and his story had not been unjustified. Certainly, these pictures carried 3
conclusive evidence of something in the Vermont hills which was at least vastly 3
outside the radius of our common knowledge and belief. The worst thing of all 3
was the footprint - a view taken where the sun shone on a mud patch somewhere 3
in a deserted upland. This was no cheaply counterfeited thing, I could see at a 3
glance; for the sharply defined pebbles and grassblades in the field of vision gave 3
a clear index of scale and left no possibility of a tricky double exposure. I have 3
called the thing a "footprint," but "claw-print" would be a better term. Even now 3
I can scarcely describe it save to say that it was hideously crablike, and that there 3
seemed to be some ambiguity about its direction. It was not a very deep or fresh 3
print, but seemed to be about the size of an average man's foot. From a central 3
pad, pairs of saw-toothed nippers projected in opposite directions - quite baffling 3
as to function, if indeed the whole object were exclusively an organ of 3
locomotion. 3

Another photograph - evidently a time-exposure taken in deep shadow - was of 3
the mouth of a woodland cave, with a boulder of, rounded regularity choking 3
the aperture. On the bare ground in front of, it one could just discern a dense 3
network of curious tracks, and when I studied the picture with a magnifier I felt 3
uneasily sure that the tracks were like the one in the other view. A third pictured 3
showed a druid-like circle of standing stones on the summit of a wild hill. 3
Around the cryptic circle the grass was very much beaten down and worn away, 3
though I could not detect any footprints even with the glass. The extreme 3
remoteness of the place was apparent from the veritable sea of tenantless: 3
mountains which formed the background and stretched away toward a. misty 3
horizon. 3
3
But if the most disturbing of all the views was that of the footprint, the' most 3
curiously suggestive was that of the great black stone found in the Round Hill 3
woods. Akeley had photographed it on what was evidently his study table, for I 3
could see rows of books and a bust of Milton in the background. The thing, as 3
nearly as one might guess, had faced the camera vertically with a somewhat 3
irregularly curved surface of one by two feet; but to say anything definite about 3
that surface, or about the general shape of the whole mass, almost defies the 3
power of language. What outlandish geometrical principles had guided its 3
cutting - for artificially cut it surely was - I could not even begin to guess; and 3
never before had I seen anything which struck me as so strangely and 3
unmistakably alien to this world. Of the hieroglyphics on the surface I could 3
discern very few, but one or two that I did see gave rather a shock. Of course 3
they might be fraudulent, for others besides myself had read the monstrous and 3
abhorred Necronomicon of the mad Arab Abdul Alhazred; but it nevertheless 3
made me shiver to recognise certain ideographs which study had taught me to 3
3
3
3
936 3
3
3
3
link with the most blood-curdhng and blasphemous whispers of things that had 3
had a kind of mad half-existence before the earth and the other inner worlds of 3
the solar system were made. 3
3
Of the five remaining pictures, three were of swamp and hill scenes which 3
seemed to bear traces of hidden and unwholesome tenancy. Another was of a 3
queer mark in the ground very near Akeley's house, which he said he had 3
photographed the morning after a night on which the dogs had barked more 3
violently than usual. It was very blurred, and one could really draw no certain 3
conclusions from it; but it did seem fiendishly like that other mark or claw -print 3
photographed on the deserted upland. The final picture was of the Akeley place 3
itself; a trim white house of two stories and attic, about a century and a quarter 3
old, and with a well-kept lawn and stone-bordered path leading up to a 3
tastefully carved Georgian doorway. There were several huge police dogs on the 3
lawn, squatting near a pleasant-faced man with a close-cropped grey beard 3
whom I took to be Akeley himself - his own photographer, one might infer from 3
the tube-connected bulb in his right hand. 3
3
From the pictures I turned to the bulky, closely-written letter itself; and for the 3
next three hours was immersed in a gulf of unutterable horror. Where Akeley 3
had given only outlines before, he now entered into minute details; presenting 3
long transcripts of words overheard in the woods at night, long accounts of 3
monstrous pinkish forms spied in thickets at twilight on the hills, and a terrible 3
cosmic narrative derived from the application of profound and varied 3
scholarship to the endless bygone discourses of the mad self- styled spy who had 3
killed himself. I found myself faced by names and terms that I had heard 3
elsewhere in the most hideous of connections - Yuggoth, Great Cthulhu, 3
Tsathoggua, YogSothoth, R'lyeh, Nyarlathotep, Azathoth, Hastur, Yian, Leng, 3
the Lake of Hali, Bethmoora, the Yellow Sign, L'mur- Kathulos, Bran, and the 3
Magnum Innominandum - and was drawn back through nameless aeons and 3
inconceivable dimensions to worlds of elder, outer entity at which the crazed 3
author of the Necronomicon had only guessed in the vaguest way. I was told of 3
the pits of primal life, and of the streams that had trickled down therefrom; and 3
finally, of the tiny rivulets from one of those streams which had become 3
entangled with the destinies of our own earth. 3
3
My brain whirled; and where before I had attempted to explain things away, I 3
now began to believe in the most abnormal and incredible wonders. The array of 3
vital evidence was damnably vast and overwhelming; and the cool, scientific 3
attitude of Akeley - an attitude removed as far as imaginable from the demented, 3
the fanatical, the hysterical, or even the. extravagantly speculative - had a 3
tremendous effect on my thought and judgment. By the time I laid the frightful 3
letter aside I could understand the fears he had come to entertain, and was ready 3
3
3
3
937 3
3
3
3
to do anything in my power to keep people away from those wild, haunted hills. 3
Even now, when time has dulled the impression and made me half-question my 3
own experience and horrible doubts, there are things in that letter of Akeley's 3
which I would not quote, or even form into words on paper. I am almost glad 3
that the letter and record and photographs are gone now - and I wish, for reasons 3
I shall soon make clear, that the new planet beyond Neptune had not been 3
discovered. 3
3
With the reading of that letter my public debating about the Vermont horror 3
permanently ended. Arguments from opponents remained unanswered or put 3
off with promises, and eventually the controversy petered out into oblivion. 3
During late May and June I was in constant correspondence with Akeley; though 3
once in a while a letter would be lost, so that we would have to retrace our 3
ground and perform considerable laborious copying. What we were trying to do, 3
as a whole, was to compare notes in matters of obscure mythological scholarship 3
and arrive at a clearer correlation of the Vermont horrors with the general body 3
of primitive world legend. 3
3
For one thing, we virtually decided that these morbidities and the hellish 3
Himalayan Mi-Go were one and the same order of incarnated nightmare. There 3
was also absorbing zoological conjectures, which I would have referred to 3
Professor Dexter in my own college but for Akeley's imperative command to tell 3
no one of the matter before us. If I seem to disobey that command now, it is only 3
because I think that at this stage a warning about those farther Vermont hills - 3
and about those Himalayan peaks which bold explorers are more and more 3
determined to ascend - is more conducive to public safety than silence would be. 3
One specific thing we were leading up to was a deciphering of the hieroglyphics 3
on that infamous black stone - a deciphering which might well place us in 3
possession of secrets deeper and more dizzying than any formerly known to 3
man. 3
3
Ill 3
3
Toward the end of June the phonograph record came - shipped from Brattleboro, 3
since Akeley was unwilling to trust conditions on the branch line north of there. 3
He had begun to feel an increased sense of espionage, aggravated by the loss of 3
some of our letters; and said much about the insidious deeds of certain men 3
whom he considered tools and agents of the hidden beings. Most of all he 3
suspected the surly farmer Walter Brown, who lived alone on a run-down 3
hillside place near the deep woods, and who was often seen loafing around 3
corners in Brattleboro, Bellows Falls, Newfane, and South Londonderry in the 3
most inexplicable and seemingly unmotivated way. Brown's voice, he felt 3
convinced, was one of those he had overheard on a certain occasion in a very 3
3
3
3
938 3
3
3
3
terrible conversation; and he had once found a footprint or clawprint near 3
Brown's house which might possess the most ominous significance. It had been 3
curiously near some of Brown's own footprints - footprints that faced toward it. 3
3
So the record was shipped from Brattleboro, whither Akeley drove in his Ford 3
car along the lonely Vermont back roads. He confessed in an accompanying note 3
that he was beginning to be afraid of those roads, and that he would not even go 3
into Townshend for supplies now except in broad daylight. It did not pay, he 3
repeated again and again, to know too much unless one were very remote from 3
those silent and problematical hills. He would be going to California pretty soon 3
to live with his son, though it was hard to leave a place where all one's memories 3
and ancestral feelings centered. 3
3
Before trying the record on the commercial machine which I borrowed from the 3
college administration building I carefully went over all the explanatory matter 3
in Akeley's various letters. This record, he had said, was obtained about 1 A.M. 3
on the 1st of May, 1915, near the closed mouth of a cave where the wooded west 3
slope of Dark Mountain rises out of Lee's swamp. The place had always been 3
unusually plagued with strange voices, this being the reason he had brought the 3
phonograph, dictaphone, and blank in expectation of results. Former experience 3
had told him that May Eve - the hideous Sabbat-night of underground European 3
legend - would probably be more fruitful than any other date, and he was not 3
disappointed. It was noteworthy, though, that he never again heard voices at 3
that particular spot. 3
3
Unlike most of the overheard forest voices, the substance of the record was 3
quasi-ritualistic, and included one palpably human voice which Akeley had 3
never been able to place. It was not Brown's, but seemed to be that of a man of 3
greater cultivation. The second voice, however, was the real crux of the thing - 3
for this was the accursed buzzing which had no likeness to humanity despite the 3
human words which it uttered in good English grammar and a scholarly accent. 3
3
The recording phonograph and dictaphone had not worked uniformly well, and 3
had of course been at a great disadvantage because of the remote and muffled 3
nature of the overheard ritual; so that the actual speech secured was very 3
fragmentary. Akeley had given me a transcript of what he believed the spoken 3
words to be, and I glanced through this again as I prepared the machine for 3
action. The text was darkly mysterious rather than openly horrible, though a 3
knowledge of its origin and manner of gathering gave it all the associative horror 3
which any words could well possess. I will present it here in full as I remember it 3
- and I am fairly confident that I know it correctly by heart, not only from 3
reading the transcript, but from playing the record itself over and over again. It is 3
not a thing which one might readily forget! 3

(Speech Cut Off by End of Record) 3
3
Such were the words for which I was to listen when I started the phonograph. It 3
was with a trace of genuine dread and reluctance that I pressed the lever and 3
heard the preliminary scratching of the sapphire point, and I was glad that the 3
first faint, fragmentary words were in a human voice - a mellow, educated voice 3
which seemed vaguely Bostonian in accent, and which was certainly not that of 3
any native of the Vermont hills. As I listened to the tantalisingly feeble rendering. 3
3
3
3
940 3
3
3
3
I seemed to find the speech identical with Akeley's carefully prepared transcript. 3
On it chanted, in that mellow Bostonian voice. . . "la! Shub- Niggurath! The Goat 3
with a Thousand Young!. . ." 3
3
And then I heard the other voice. To this hour I shudder retrospectively when I 3
think of how it struck me, prepared though I was by Akeley's accounts. Those to 3
whom I have since described the record profess to find nothing but cheap 3
imposture or madness in it; but could they have the accursed thing itself, or read 3
the bulk of Akeley's correspondence, (especially that terrible and encyclopaedic 3
second letter), I know they would think differently. It is, after all, a tremendous 3
pity that I did not disobey Akeley and play the record for others - a tremendous 3
pity, too, that all of his letters were lost. To me, with my first-hand impression of 3
the actual sounds, and with my knowledge of the background and surrounding 3
circumstances, the voice was a monstrous thing. It swiftly followed the human 3
voice in ritualistic response, but in my imagination it was a morbid echo winging 3
its way across unimaginable abysses from unimaginable outer hells. It is more 3
than two years now since I last ran off that blasphemous waxen cylinder; but at 3
this moment, and at all other moments, I can still hear that feeble, fiendish 3
buzzing as it reached me for the first time. 3
3
"la! Shub-Niggurath! The Black Goat of the Woods with a Thousand Young!" 3
3
But though the voice is always in my ears, I have not even yet been able to 3
analyse it well enough for a graphic description. It was like the drone of some 3
loathsome, gigantic insect ponderously shaped into the articulate speech of an 3
alien species, and I am perfectly certain that the organs producing it can have no 3
resemblance to the vocal organs of man, or indeed to those of any of the 3
mammalia. There were singularities in timbre, range, and overtones which 3
placed this phenomenon wholly outside the sphere of humanity and earth-life. 3
Its sudden advent that first time almost stunned me, and I heard the rest of the 3
record through in a sort of abstracted daze. When the longer passage of buzzing 3
came, there was a sharp intensification of that feeling of blasphemous infinity 3
which had struck me during the shorter and earlier passage. At last the record 3
ended abruptly, during an unusually clear speech of the human and Bostonian 3
voice; but I sat stupidly staring long after the machine had automatically 3
stopped. 3
3
I hardly need say that I gave that shocking record many another playing, and 3
that I made exhaustive attempts at analysis and comment in comparing notes 3
with Akeley. It would be both useless and disturbing to repeat here all that we 3
concluded; but I may hint that we agreed in believing we had secured a clue to 3
the source of some of the most repulsive primordial customs in the cryptic elder 3
religions of mankind. It seemed plain to us, also, that there were ancient and 3
3
3
3
941 3
3
3
3
elaborate alliance; between the hidden outer creatures and certain members of 3
the human race. How extensive these alliances were, and how their state today 3
might compare with their state in earlier ages, we had no means of guessing; yet 3
at best there was room for a limitless amount of horrified speculation. There 3
seemed to be an awful, immemorial linkage in several definite stages betwixt 3
man and nameless infinity. The blasphemies which appeared on earth, it was 3
hinted, came from the dark planet Yuggoth, at the rim of the solar system; but 3
this was itself merely the populous outpost of a frightful interstellar race whose 3
ultimate source must lie far outside even the Einsteinian space-time continuum 3
or greatest known cosmos. 3
3
Meanwhile we continued to discuss the black stone and the best way of getting it 3
to Arkham - Akeley deeming it inadvisable to have me visit him at the scene of 3
his nightmare studies. For some reason or other, Akeley was afraid to trust the 3
thing to any ordinary or expected transportation route. His final idea was to take 3
it across country to Bellows Falls and ship it on the Boston and Maine system 3
through Keene and Winchendon and Fitchburg, even though this would 3
necessitate his driving along somewhat lonelier and more forest-traversing hill 3
roads than the main highway to Brattleboro. He said he had noticed a man 3
around the express office at Brattleboro when he had sent the phonograph 3
record, whose actions and expression had been far from reassuring. This man 3
had seemed too anxious to talk with the clerks, and had taken the train on which 3
the record was shipped. Akeley confessed that he had not felt strictly at ease 3
about that record until he heard from me of its safe receipt. 3
3
About this time - the second week in July - another letter of mine went astray, as 3
I learned through an anxious communication from Akeley. After that he told me 3
to address him no more at Townshend, but to send all mail in care of the General 3
Delivery at Brattleboro; whither he would make frequent trips either in his car or 3
on the motor-coach line which had lately replaced passenger service on the 3
lagging branch railway. I could see that he was getting more and more anxious, 3
for he went into much detail about the increased barking of the dogs on 3
moonless nights, and about the fresh claw-prints he sometimes found in the road 3
and in the mud at the back of his farmyard when morning came. Once he told 3
about a veritable army of prints drawn up in a line facing an equally thick and 3
resolute line of dog-tracks, and sent a loathsomely disturbing Kodak picture to 3
prove it. That was after a night on which the dogs had outdone themselves in 3
barking and howling. 3
3
On the morning of Wednesday, July 18, 1 received a telegram from Bellows Falls, 3
in which Akeley said he was expressing the black stone over the B. & M. on Train 3
No. 5508, leaving Bellows Falls at 12:15 P.M., standard time, and due at the 3
North Station in Boston at 4:12 P.M. It ought, I calculated, to get up to Arkham at 3
3
3
3
942 3
3
3
3
least by the next noon; and accordingly I stayed in all Thursday morning to 3
receive it. But noon came and went without its advent, and when I telephoned 3
down to the express office I was informed that no shipment for me had arrived. 3
My next act, performed amidst a growing alarm, was to give a long- distance call 3
to the express agent at the Boston North Station; and I was scarcely surprised to 3
learn that my consignment had not appeared. Train No. 5508 had pulled in only 3
35 minutes late on the day before, but had contained no box addressed to me. 3
The agent promised, however, to institute a searching inquiry; and I ended the 3
day by sending Akeley a night-letter outlining the situation. 3
3
With commendable promptness a report came from the Boston office on the 3
following afternoon, the agent telephoning as soon as he learned the facts. It 3
seemed that the railway express clerk on No. 5508 had been able to recall an 3
incident which might have much bearing on my loss - an argument with a very 3
curious-voiced man, lean, sandy, and rustic-looking, when the train was waiting 3
at Keene, N. H., shortly after one o'clock standard time. The man, he said, was 3
greatly excited about a heavy box which he claimed to expect, but which was 3
neither on the train nor entered on the company's books. He had given the name 3
of Stanley Adams, and had had such a queerly thick droning voice, that it made 3
the clerk abnormally dizzy and sleepy to listen to him. The clerk could not 3
remember quite how the conversation had ended, but recalled starting into a 3
fuller awakeness when the train began to move. The Boston agent added that this 3
clerk was a young man of wholly unquestioned veracity and reliability, of 3
known antecedents and long with the company. 3
3
That evening I went to Boston to interview the clerk in person, having obtained 3
his name and address from the office. He was a frank, prepossessing fellow, but I 3
saw that he could add nothing to his original account. Oddly, he was scarcely 3
sure that he could even recognise the strange inquirer again. Realising that he 3
had no more to tell, I returned to Arkham and sat up till morning writing letters 3
to Akeley, to the express company and to the police department and station 3
agent in Keene. I felt that the strange-voiced man who had so queerly affected 3
the clerk must have a pivotal place in the ominous business, and hoped that 3
Keene station employees and telegraph-office records might tell something about 3
him and about how he happened to make his inquiry when and where he did. 3
3
I must admit, however, that all my investigations came to nothing. The queer- 3
voiced man had indeed been noticed around the Keene station in the early 3
afternoon of July 18, and one lounger seemed to couple him vaguely with a 3
heavy box; but he was altogether unknown, and had not been seen before or 3
since. He had not visited the telegraph office or received any message so far as 3
could be learned, nor had any message which might justly be considered a notice 3
of the black stone's presence on No. 5508 come through the office for anyone. 3
3
3
3
943 3
3
3
3
Naturally Akeley joined with me in conducting these inquiries, and even made a 3
personal trip to Keene to question the people around the station; but his attitude 3
toward the matter was more fatalistic than mine. He seemed to find the loss of 3
the box a portentous and menacing fulfillment of inevitable tendencies, and had 3
no real hope at all of its recovery. He spoke of the undoubted telepathic and 3
hypnotic powers of the hill creatures and their agents, and in one letter hinted 3
that he did not believe the stone was on this earth any longer. For my part, I was 3
duly enraged, for I had felt there was at least a chance of learning profound and 3
astonishing things from the old, blurred hieroglyphs. The matter would have 3
rankled bitterly in my mind had not Akeley's immediately subsequent letters 3
brought up a new phase of the whole horrible hill problem which at once seized 3
all my attention. 3
3
IV 3
3
The unknown things, Akeley wrote in a script grown pitifully tremulous, had 3
begun to close in on him with a wholly new degree of determination. The 3
nocturnal barking of the dogs whenever the moon, was dim or absent was 3
hideous now, and there had been attempts to molest him on the lonely roads he 3
had to traverse by day. On the second of August, while bound for the village in 3
his car, he had found a tree-trunk laid in his path at a point where the highway 3
ran through a deep patch of woods; while the savage barking of the two great 3
dogs he had with him told all too well of the things which must have been 3
lurking near. What would have happened had the dogs not been there, he did 3
not dare guess - but he never went out now without at least two of his faithful 3
and powerful pack. Other road experiences had occurred on August fifth and 3
sixth; a shot grazing his car on one occasion, and the barking of the dogs telling 3
of unholy woodland presences on the other. 3
3
On August fifteenth I received a frantic letter which disturbed me greatly, and 3
which made me wish Akeley could put aside his lonely reticence and call in the 3
aid of the law. There had been frightful happening on the night of the 12-13th, 3
bullets flying outside the farmhouse, and three of the twelve great dogs being 3
found shot dead in the morning. There were myriads of claw-prints in the road, 3
with the human prints of Walter Brown among them. Akeley had started to 3
telephone to Brattleboro for more dogs, but the wire had gone dead before he 3
had a chance to say much. Later he went to Brattleboro in his car, and learned 3
there that linemen had found the main cable neatly cut at a point where it ran 3
through the deserted hills north of Newfane. But he was about to start home 3
with four fine new dogs, and several cases of ammunition for his big-game 3
repeating rifle. The letter was written at the post office in Brattleboro, and came 3
through to me without delay. 3
3
3
3
944 3
3
3
3
My attitude toward the matter was by this time quickly shpping from a scientific 3
to an alarmedly personal one. I was afraid for Akeley in his remote, lonely 3
farmhouse, and half afraid for myself because of my now definite connection 3
with the strange hill problem. The thing was reaching out so. Would it suck me 3
in and engulf me? In replying to his letter I urged him to seek help, and hinted 3
that I might take action myself if he did not. I spoke of visiting Vermont in 3
person in spite of his wishes, and of helping him explain the situation to the 3
proper authorities. In return, however, I received only a telegram from Bellows 3
Falls which read thus: 3
3
APPRECIATE YOUR POSITION BUT CAN DO NOTHING TAKE NO ACTION 3
YOURSELF FOR IT COULD ONLY HARM BOTH WAIT FOR EXPLANATION 3
3
HENRY AKELY 3
3
But the affair was steadily deepening. Upon my replying to the telegram I 3
received a shaky note from Akeley with the astonishing news that he had not 3
only never sent the wire, but had not received the letter from me to which it was 3
an obvious reply. Hasty inquiries by him at Bellows Falls had brought out that 3
the message was deposited by a strange sandy-haired man with a curiously 3
thick, droning voice, though more than this he could not learn. The clerk showed 3
him the original text as scrawled in pencil by the sender, but the handwriting 3
was wholly unfamiliar. It was noticeable that the signature was misspelled - A- 3
K-E-L-Y, without the second "E." Certain conjectures were inevitable, but amidst 3
the obvious crisis he did not stop to elaborate upon them. 3
3
He spoke of the death of more dogs and the purchase of still others, and of the 3
exchange of gunfire which had become a settled feature each moonless night. 3
Brown's prints, and the prints of at least one or two more shod human figures, 3
were now found regularly among the claw-prints in the road, and at the back of 3
the farmyard. It was, Akeley admitted, a pretty bad business; and before long he 3
would probably have to go to live with his California son whether or not he 3
could sell the old place. But it was not easy to leave the only spot one could 3
really think of as home. He must try to hang on a little longer; perhaps he could 3
scare off the intruders - especially if he openly gave up all further attempts to 3
penetrate their secrets. 3
3
Writing Akeley at once, I renewed my offers of aid, and spoke again of visiting 3
him and helping him convince the authorities of his dire peril. In his reply he 3
seemed less set against that plan than his past attitude would have led one to 3
predict, but said he would like to hold off a little while longer - long enough to 3
get his things in order and reconcile himself to the idea of leaving an almost 3
morbidly cherished birthplace. People looked askance at his studies and 3
3
3
3
945 3
3
3
3
speculations and it would be better to get quietly off without setting the 3
countryside in a turmoil and creating widespread doubts of his own sanity. He 3
had had enough, he admitted, but he. wanted to make a dignified exit if he 3
could. 3
3
This letter reached me on the 28th of August, and I prepared and mailed as 3
encouraging a reply as I could. Apparently the encouragement had effect, for 3
Akeley had fewer terrors to report when he acknowledged my note. He was not 3
very optimistic, though, and expressed the belief that it was only the full moon 3
season which was holding the creatures off. He hoped there would not be many 3
densely cloudy nights, and talked vaguely of boarding in Brattleboro when the 3
moon waned. Again I wrote him encouragingly but on September 5th there came 3
a fresh communication which had obviously crossed my letter in the mails; and 3
to this I could not give any such hopeful response. In view of its importance I 3
believe I had better give it in full - as best I can do from memory of the shaky 3
script. It ran substantially as follows: 3
3
Monday 3
3
Dear Wilmarth 3
3
A rather discouraging P. S. to my last. Last night was thickly cloudy - though no 3
rain - and not a bit of moonlight got through. Things were pretty bad, and I think 3
the end is getting near, in spite of all we have hoped. After midnight something 3
landed on the roof of the house, and the dogs all rushed up to see what it was. I 3
could hear them snapping and tearing around, and then one managed to get on 3
the roof by jumping from the low ell. There was a terrible fight up there, and I 3
heard a frightful buzzing which I'll never forget. And then there was a shocking 3
smell. About the same time bullets came through the window and nearly grazed 3
me. I think the main line of the hill creatures had got close to the house when the 3
dogs divided because of the roof business. What was up there I don't know yet, 3
but I'm afraid the creatures are learning to steer better with their space wings. I 3
put out the light and used the windows for loopholes, and raked all around the 3
house with rifle fire aimed just high enough not to hit the dogs. That seemed to 3
end the business, but in the morning I found great pools of blood in the yard, 3
besides pools of a green sticky stuff that had the worst odour I have ever 3
smelled. I climbed up on the roof and found more of the sticky stuff there. Five of 3
the dogs were killed - I'm afraid I hit one myself by aiming too low, for he was 3
shot in the back. Now I am setting the panes the shots broke, and am going to 3
Brattleboro for more dogs. I guess the men at the kennels think I am crazy. Will 3
drop another note later. Suppose I'll be ready for moving in a week or two, 3
though it nearly kills me to think of it. 3

Hastily - Akeley 3
3
But this was not the only letter from Akeley to cross mine. On the next morning - 3
September 6th - still another came; this time a frantic scrawl which utterly 3
unnerved me and put me at a loss what to say or do next. Again I cannot do 3
better than quote the text as faithfully as memory will let me. 3
3
Tuesday 3
3
Clouds didn't break, so no moon again - and going into the wane anyhow. I'd 3
have the house wired for electricity and put in a searchlight if I didn't know 3
they'd cut the cables as fast as they could be mended. 3
3
I think I am going crazy. It may be that all I have ever written you is a dream or 3
madness. It was bad enough before, but this time it is too much. They talked to 3
me last night - talked in that cursed buzzing voice and told me things that I dare 3
not repeat to you. I heard them plainly above the barking of the dogs, and once 3
when they were drowned out a human voice helped them. Keep out of this, 3
Wilmarth - it is worse than either you or I ever suspected. They don't mean to let 3
me get to California now - they want to take me off alive, or what theoretically 3
and mentally amounts to alive - not only to Yuggoth, but beyond that - away 3
outside the galaxy and possibly beyond the last curved rim of space. I told them I 3
wouldn't go where they wish, or in the terrible way they propose to take me, but 3
I'm afraid it will be no use. My place is so far out that they may come by day as 3
well as by night before long. Six more dogs killed, and I felt presences all along 3
the wooded parts of the road when I drove to Brattleboro today. It was a mistake 3
for me to try to send you that phonograph record and black stone. Better smash 3
the record before it's too late. Will drop you another line tomorrow if I'm still 3
here. Wish I could arrange to get my books and things to Brattleboro and board 3
there. I would run off without anything if I could but something inside my mind 3
holds me back. I can slip out to Brattleboro, where I ought to be safe, but I feel 3
just as much a prisoner there as at the house. And I seem to know that I couldn't 3
get much farther even if I dropped everything and tried. It is horrible - don't get 3
mixed up in this. 3
3
Yrs - Akeley 3
3
I did not sleep at all the night after receiving this terrible thing, and was utterly 3
baffled as to Akeley's remaining degree of sanity. The substance of the note was 3
wholly insane, yet the manner of expression - in view of all that had gone before 3
- had a grimly potent quality of convincingness. I made no attempt to answer it, 3
thinking it better to wait until Akeley might have time to reply to my latest 3
communication. Such a reply indeed came on the following day, though the 3
3
3
3
947 3
3
3
3
fresh material in it quite overshadowed any of the points brought up by the letter 3
nominally answered. Here is what I recall of the text, scrawled and blotted as it 3
was in the course of a plainly frantic and hurried composition. 3
3
Wednesday 3
3
W- 3
3
Your letter came, but it's no use to discuss anything any more. I am fully 3
resigned. Wonder that I have even enough will power left to fight them off. Can't 3
escape even if I were willing to give up everything and run. They'll get me. 3
3
Had a letter from them yesterday - R.F.D. man brought it while I was at 3
Brattleboro. Typed and postmarked Bellows Falls. Tells what they want to do 3
with me - 1 can't repeat it. Look out for yourself, too! Smash that record. Cloudy 3
nights keep up, and moon waning all the time. Wish I dared to get help - it might 3
brace up my will power - but everyone who would dare to come at all would call 3
me crazy unless there happened to be some proof. Couldn't ask people to come 3
for no reason at all - am all out of touch with everybody and have been for years. 3
3
But I haven't told you the worst, Wilmarth. Brace up to read this, for it will give 3
you a shock. I am telling the truth, though. It is this - I have seen and touched 3
one of the things, or part of one of the things. God, man, but it's awful! It was 3
dead, of course. One of the dogs had it, and I found it near the kennel this 3
morning. I tried to save it in the woodshed to convince people of the whole 3
thing, but it all evaporated in a few hours. Nothing left. You know, all those 3
things in the rivers were seen only on the first morning after the flood. And 3
here's the worst. I tried to photograph it for you, but when I developed the film 3
there wasn't anything visible except the woodshed. What can the thing have 3
been made of? I saw it and felt it, and they all leave footprints. It was surely 3
made of matter - but what kind of matter? The shape can't be described. It was a 3
great crab with a lot of pyramided fleshy rings or knots of thick, ropy stuff 3
covered with feelers where a man's head would be. That green sticky stuff is its 3
blood or juice. And there are more of them due on earth any minute. 3
3
Walter Brown is missing - hasn't been seen loafing around any of his usual 3
corners in the villages hereabouts. I must have got him with one of my shots, 3
though the creatures always seem to try to take their dead and wounded away. 3
3
Got into town this afternoon without any trouble, but am afraid they're 3
beginning to hold off because they're sure of me. Am writing this in Brattleboro 3
P. 0. This may be goodbye - if it is, write my son George Goodenough Akeley, 3
3
3
3
948 3
3
3
3
176 Pleasant St., San Diego, Cal., but don't come up here. Write the boy if you 3
don't hear from me in a week, and watch the papers for news. 3
3
I'm going to play my last two cards now - if I have the will power left. First to try 3
poison gas on the things (I've got the right chemicals and have fixed up masks 3
for myself and the dogs) and then if that doesn't work, tell the sheriff. They can 3
lock me in a madhouse if they want to - it'll be better than what the other 3
creatures would do. Perhaps I can get them to pay attention to the prints around 3
the house - they are faint, but I can find them every morning. Suppose, though, 3
police would say I faked them somehow; for they all think I'm a queer character. 3
3
Must try to have a state policeman spend a night here and see for himself - 3
though it would be just like the creatures to learn about it and hold off that night. 3
They cut my wires whenever I try to telephone in the night - the linemen think it 3
is very queer, and may testify for me if they don't go and imagine I cut them 3
myself. I haven't tried to keep them repaired for over a week now. 3
3
I could get some of the ignorant people to testify for me about the reality of the 3
horrors, but everybody laughs at what they say, and anyway, they have shunned 3
my place for so long that they don't know any of the new events. You couldn't 3
get one of those rundown farmers to come within a mile of my house for love or 3
money. The mail-carrier hears what they say and jokes me about it - God! If I 3
only dared tell him how real it is! I think I'll try to get him to notice the prints, 3
but he comes in the afternoon and they're usually about gone by that time. If I 3
kept one by setting a box or pan over it, he'd think surely it was a fake or joke. 3
3
Wish I hadn't gotten to be such a hermit, so folks don't drop around as they used 3
to. I've never dared show the black stone or the Kodak pictures, or play that 3
record, to anybody but the ignorant people. The others would say I faked the 3
whole business and do nothing but laugh. But I may yet try showing the 3
pictures. They give those claw -prints clearly, even if the things that made them 3
can't be photographed. What a shame nobody else saw that thing this morning 3
before it went to nothing! 3
3
But I don't know as I care. After what I've been through, a madhouse is as good a 3
place as any. The doctors can help me make up my mind to get away from this 3
house, and that is all that will save me. 3
3
Write my son George if you don't hear soon. Goodbye, smash that record, and 3
don't mix up in this. 3
3
Yrs - Akeley 3
3
3
3

3
3
3
This letter frankly plunged me into the blackest of terror. I did not know what to 3
say in answer, but scratched off some incoherent words of advice and 3
encouragement and sent them by registered mail. I recall urging Akeley to move 3
to Brattleboro at once, and place himself under the protection of the authorities; 3
adding that I would come to that town with the phonograph record and help 3
convince the courts of his sanity. It was time, too, I think I wrote, to alarm the 3
people generally against this thing in their midst. It will be observed that at this 3
moment of stress my own belief in all Akeley had told and claimed was virtually 3
complete, though I did think his failure to get a picture of the dead monster was 3
due not to any freak of Nature but to some excited slip of his own. 3
3
V 3
3
Then, apparently crossing my incoherent note and reaching me Saturday 3
afternoon, September 8th, came that curiously different and calming letter neatly 3
typed on a new machine; that strange letter of reassurance and invitation which 3
must have marked so prodigious a transition in the whole nightmare drama of 3
the lonely hills. Again I will quote from memory - seeking for special reasons to 3
preserve as much of the flavour of the style as I can. It was postmarked Bellows 3
Falls, and the signature as well as the body of the letter was typed - as is frequent 3
with beginners in typing. The text, though, was marvellously accurate for a tyro's 3
work; and I concluded that Akeley must have used a machine at some previous 3
period - perhaps in college. To say that the letter relieved me would be only fair, 3
yet beneath my relief lay a substratum of uneasiness. If Akeley had been sane in 3
his terror, was he now sane in his deliverance? And the sort of "improved 3
rapport" mentioned . . . what was it? The entire thing implied such a diametrical 3
reversal of Akeley's previous attitude! But here is the substance of the text, 3
carefully transcribed from a memory in which I take some pride. 3
3
Townshend, Vermont, 3
3
Thursday, Sept. 6, 1928. 3
3
My dear Wilmarth: - 3
3
It gives me great pleasure to be able to set you at rest regarding all the silly 3
things I've been writing you. I say "silly," although by that I mean my frightened 3
attitude rather than my descriptions of certain phenomena. Those phenomena 3
are real and important enough; my mistake had been in establishing an 3
anomalous attitude toward them. 3
3
I think I mentioned that my strange visitors were beginning to communicate 3
with me, and to attempt such communication. Last night this exchange of speech 3
became actual. In response to certain signals I admitted to the house a messenger 3
3
3
3
950 3
3
3
3
from those outside - a fellow-human, let me hasten to say. He told me much that 3
neither you nor I had even begun to guess, and showed clearly how totally we 3
had misjudged and misinterpreted the purpose of the Outer Ones in maintaining 3
their secret colony on this planet. 3
3
It seems that the evil legends about what they have offered to men, and what 3
they wish in connection with the earth, are wholly the result of an ignorant 3
misconception of allegorical speech - speech, of course, moulded by cultural 3
backgrounds and thought-habits vastly different from anything we dream of. My 3
own conjectures, I freely own, shot as widely past the mark as any of the guesses 3
of illiterate farmers and savage Indians. What I had thought morbid and 3
shameful and ignominious is in reality awesome and mind- expanding and even 3
glorious - my previous estimate being merely a phase of man's eternal tendency 3
to hate and fear and shrink from the utterly different. 3
3
Now I regret the harm I have inflicted upon these alien and incredible beings in 3
the course of our nightly skirmishes. If only I had consented to talk peacefully 3
and reasonably with them in the first place! But they bear me no grudge, their 3
emotions being organised very differently from ours. It is their misfortune to 3
have had as their human agents in Vermont some very inferior specimens - the 3
late Walter Brown, for example. He prejudiced me vastly against them. Actually, 3
they have never knowingly harmed men, but have often been cruelly wronged 3
and spied upon by our species. There is a whole secret cult of evil men (a man of 3
your mystical erudition will understand me when I link them with Hastur and 3
the Yellow Sign) devoted to the purpose of tracking them down and injuring 3
them on behalf of monstrous powers from other dimensions. It is against these 3
aggressors - not against normal humanity - that the drastic precautions of the 3
Outer Ones are directed. Incidentally, I learned that many of our lost letters were 3
stolen not by the Outer Ones but by the emissaries of this malign cult. 3
3
All that the Outer Ones wish of man is peace and non-molestation and an 3
increasing intellectual rapport. This latter is absolutely necessary now that our 3
inventions and devices are expanding our knowledge and motions, and making 3
it more and more impossible for the Outer Ones' necessary outposts to exist 3
secretly on this planet. The alien beings desire to know mankind more fully, and 3
to have a few of mankind's philosophic and scientific leaders know more about 3
them. With such an exchange of knowledge all perils will pass, and a satisfactory 3
modus Vivendi be established. The very idea of any attempt to enslave or 3
degrade mankind is ridiculous. 3
3
As a beginning of this improved rapport, the Outer Ones have naturally chosen 3
me - whose knowledge of them is already so considerable - as their primary 3
interpreter on earth. Much was told me last night - facts of the most stupendous 3
3
3
3
951 3
3
3
3
and vista-opening nature - and more will be subsequently communicated to me 3
both orally and in writing. I shall not be called upon to make any trip outside just 3
yet, though I shall probably wish to do so later on - employing special means and 3
transcending everything which we have hitherto been accustomed to regard as 3
human experience. My house will be besieged no longer. Everything has 3
reverted to normal, and the dogs will have no further occupation. In place of 3
terror I have been given a rich boon of knowledge and intellectual adventure 3
which few other mortals have ever shared. 3
3
The Outer Beings are perhaps the most marvellous organic things in or beyond 3
all space and time-members of a cosmos-wide race of which all other life-forms 3
are merely degenerate variants. They are more vegetable than animal, if these 3
terms can be applied to the sort of matter composing them, and have a somewhat 3
fungoid structure; though the presence of a chlorophyll-like substance and a very 3
singular nutritive system differentiate them altogether from true cormophytic 3
fungi. Indeed, the type is composed of a form of matter totally alien to our part of 3
space - with electrons having a wholly different vibration-rate. That is why the 3
beings cannot be photographed on the ordinary camera films and plates of our 3
known universe, even though our eyes can see them. With proper knowledge, 3
however, any good chemist could make a photographic emulsion which would 3
record their images. 3
3
The genus is unique in its ability to traverse the heatless and airless interstellar 3
void in full corporeal form, and some of its variants cannot do this without 3
mechanical aid or curious surgical transpositions. Only a few species have the 3
ether-resisting wings characteristic of the Vermont variety. Those inhabiting 3
certain remote peaks in the Old World were brought in other ways. Their 3
external resemblance to animal life, and to the sort of structure we understand as 3
material, is a matter of parallel evolution rather than of close kinship. Their 3
brain-capacity exceeds that of any other surviving life-form, although the winged 3
types of our hill country are by no means the most highly developed. Telepathy 3
is their usual means of discourse, though we have rudimentary vocal organs 3
which, after a slight operation (for surgery is an incredibly expert and everyday 3
thing among them), can roughly duplicate the speech of such types of organism 3
as still use speech. 3
3
Their main immediate abode is a still undiscovered and almost lightless planet at 3
the very edge of our solar system - beyond Neptune, and the ninth in distance 3
from the sun. It is, as we have inferred, the object mystically hinted at as 3
"Yuggoth" in certain ancient and forbidden writings; and it will soon be the 3
scene of a strange focussing of thought upon our world in an effort to facilitate 3
mental rapport. I would not be surprised if astronomers become sufficiently 3
sensitive to these thought-currents to discover Yuggoth when the Outer Ones 3
3
3
3
952 3
3
3
3
wish them to do so. But Yuggoth, of course, is only the stepping-stone. The main 3
body of the beings inhabits strangely organized abysses wholly beyond the 3
utmost reach of any human imagination. The space-time globule which we 3
recognize as the totality of all cosmic entity is only an atom in the genuine 3
infinity which is theirs. And as much of this infinity as any human brain can hold 3
is eventually to be opened up to me, as it has been to not more than fifty other 3
men since the human race has existed. 3
3
You will probably call this raving at first, Wilmarth, but in time you will 3
appreciate the titanic opportunity I have stumbled upon. I want you to share as 3
much of it as is possible, and to that end must tell you thousands of things that 3
won't go on paper. In the past I have warned you not to come to see me. Now 3
that all is safe, I take pleasure in rescinding that warning and inviting you. 3
3
Can't you make a trip up here before your college term opens? It would be 3
marvelously delightful if you could. Bring along the phonograph record and all 3
my letters to you as consultative data - we shall need them in piecing together 3
the whole tremendous story. You might bring the Kodak prints, too, since I seem 3
to have mislaid the negatives and my own prints in all this recent excitement. But 3
what a wealth of facts I have to add to all this groping and tentative material - 3
and what a stupendous device I have to supplement my additions! 3
3
Don't hesitate - I am free from espionage now, and you will not meet anything 3
unnatural or disturbing. Just come along and let my car meet you at the 3
Brattleboro station - prepare to stay as long as you can, and expect many an 3
evening of discussion of things beyond all human conjecture. Don't tell anyone 3
about it, of course - for this matter must not get to the promiscuous public. 3
3
The train service to Brattleboro is not bad - you can get a timetable in Boston. 3
Take the B. & M. to Greenfield, and then change for the brief remainder of the 3
way. I suggest your taking the convenient 4:10 P.M. - standard-from Boston. This 3
gets into Greenfield at 7:35, and at 9:19 a train leaves there which reaches 3
Brattleboro at 10:01. That is weekdays. Let me know the date and I'll have my car 3
on hand at the station. 3
3
Pardon this typed letter, but my handwriting has grown shaky of late, as you 3
know, and I don't feel equal to long stretches of script. I got this new Corona in 3
Brattleboro yesterday - it seems to work very well. 3
3
Awaiting word, and hoping to see you shortly with the phonograph record and 3
all my letters - and the Kodak prints - 3
3
3

TO ALBERT N. WILMARTH, ESQ., 3
3
MISKATONIC UNIVERSITY, 3
3
ARKHAM, MASS. 3
3
The complexity of my emotions upon reading, re-reading, and pondering over 3
this strange and unlooked- for letter is past adequate description. I have said that 3
I was at once relieved and made uneasy, but this expresses only crudely the 3
overtones of diverse and largely subconscious feelings which comprised both the 3
relief and the uneasiness. To begin with, the thing was so antipodally at variance 3
with the whole chain of horrors preceding it - the change of mood from stark 3
terror to cool complacency and even exultation was so unheralded, lightning- 3
like, and complete! I could scarcely believe that a single day could so alter the 3
psychological perspective of one who had written that final frenzied bulletin of 3
Wednesday, no matter what relieving disclosures that day might have brought. 3
At certain moments a sense of conflicting unrealities made me wonder whether 3
this whole distantly reported drama of fantastic forces were not a kind of half- 3
illusory dream created largely within my own mind. Then I thought of the 3
phonograph record and gave way to still greater bewilderment. 3
3
The letter seemed so unlike anything which could have been expected! As I 3
analysed my impression, I saw that it consisted of two distinct phases. First, 3
granting that Akeley had been sane before and was still sane, the indicated 3
change in the situation itself was so swift and unthinkable. And secondly, the 3
change in Akeley's own manner, attitude, and language was so vastly beyond 3
the normal or the predictable. The man's whole personality seemed to have 3
undergone an insidious mutation - a mutation so deep that one could scarcely 3
reconcile his two aspects with the supposition that both represented equal sanity. 3
Word- choice, spelling - all were subtly different. And with my academic 3
sensitiveness to prose style, I could trace profound divergences in his commonest 3
reactions and rhythm-responses. Certainly, the emotional cataclysm or revelation 3
which could produce so radical an overturn must be an extreme one indeed! Yet 3
in another way the letter seemed quite characteristic of Akeley. The same old 3
passion for infinity - the same old scholarly inquisitiveness. I could not a moment 3
- or more than a moment - credit the idea of spuriousness or malign substitution. 3
Did not the invitation - the willingness to have me test the truth of the letter in 3
person - prove its genuineness? 3
3
I did not retire Saturday night, but sat up thinking of the shadows and marvels 3
behind the letter I had received. My mind, aching from the quick succession of 3
3
3
3
954 3
3
3
3
monstrous conceptions it had been forced to confront during the last four 3
months, worked upon this starthng new material in a cycle of doubt and 3
acceptance which repeated most of the steps experienced in facing the earlier 3
wonders; till long before dawn a burning interest and curiosity had begun to 3
replace the original storm of perplexity and uneasiness. Mad or sane, 3
metamorphosed or merely relieved, the chances were that Akeley had actually 3
encountered some stupendous change of perspective in his hazardous research; 3
some change at once diminishing his danger - real or fancied - and opening dizzy 3
new vistas of cosmic and superhuman knowledge. My own zeal for the 3
unknown flared up to meet his, and I felt myself touched by the contagion of the 3
morbid barrier-breaking. To shake off the maddening and wearying limitations 3
of time and space and natural law - to be linked with the vast outside - to come 3
close to the nighted and abysmal secrets of the infinite and the ultimate - surely 3
such a thing was worth the risk of one's life, soul, and sanity! And Akeley had 3
said there was no longer any peril - he had invited me to visit him instead of 3
warning me away as before. I tingled at the thought of what he might now have 3
to tell me - there was an almost paralysing fascination in the thought of sitting in 3
that lonely and lately-beleaguered farmhouse with a man who had talked with 3
actual emissaries from outer space; sitting there with the terrible record and the 3
pile of letters in which Akeley had summarised his earlier conclusions. 3
3
So late Sunday morning I telegraphed Akeley that I would meet him in 3
Brattleboro on the following Wednesday - September 12th - if that date were 3
convenient for him. In only one respect did I depart from his suggestions, and 3
that concerned the choice of a train. Frankly, I did not feel like arriving in that 3
haunted Vermont region late at night; so instead of accepting the train he chose I 3
telephoned the station and devised another arrangement. By rising early and 3
taking the 8:07 A.M. (standard) into Boston, I could catch the 9:25 for Greenfield; 3
arriving there at 12:22 noon. This connected exactly with a train reaching 3
Brattleboro at 1:08 p.m. - a much more comfortable hour than 10:01 for meeting 3
Akeley and riding with him into the close-packed, secret-guarding hills. 3
3
I mentioned this choice in my telegram, and was glad to learn in the reply which 3
came toward evening that it had met with my prospective host's endorsement. 3
His wire ran thus: 3
3

Receipt of this message in direct response to one sent to Akeley - and necessarily 3
delivered to his house from the Townshend station either by official messenger 3
or by a restored telephone service - removed any lingering subconscious doubts I 3
may have had about the authorship of the perplexing letter. My relief was 3
marked - indeed, it was greater than I could account for at the time; since all such 3
doubts had been rather deeply buried. But I slept soundly and long that night, 3
and was eagerly busy with preparations during the ensuing two days. 3
3
VI 3
3
On Wednesday I started as agreed,, taking with me a valise full of simple 3
necessities and scientific data, including the hideous phonograph record, the 3
Kodak prints, and the entire file of Akeley's correspondence. As requested, I had 3
told no one where I was going; for I could see that the matter demanded utmost 3
privacy, even allowing for its most favourable turns. The thought of actual 3
mental contact with alien, outside entities was stupefying enough to my trained 3
and somewhat prepared mind; and this being so, what might one think of its 3
effect on the vast masses of uninformed laymen? I do not know whether dread or 3
adventurous expectancy was uppermost in me as I changed trains at Boston and 3
began the long westward run out of familiar regions into those I knew less 3
thoroughly. Waltham - Concord - Ayer - Fitchburg - Gardner - Athol - 3
3
My train reached Greenfield seven minutes late, but the northbound connecting 3
express had been held. Transferring in haste, I felt a curious breathlessness as the 3
cars rumbled on through the early afternoon sunlight into territories I had 3
always read of but had never before visited. I knew I was entering an altogether 3
older-fashioned and more primitive New England than the mechanised, 3
urbanised coastal and southern areas where all my life had been spent; an 3
unspoiled, ancestral New England without the foreigners and factory-smoke, 3
bill-boards and concrete roads, of the sections which modernity has touched. 3
There would be odd survivals of that continuous native life whose deep roots 3
make it the one authentic outgrowth of the landscape - the continuous native life 3
which keeps alive strange ancient memories, and fertilises the soil for shadowy, 3
marvellous, and seldom-mentioned beliefs. 3
3
Now and then I saw the blue Connecticut River gleaming in the sun, and after 3
leaving Northfield we crossed it. Ahead loomed green and cryptical hills, and 3
when the conductor came around I learned that I was at last in Vermont. He told 3
me to set my watch back an hour, since the northern hill country will have no 3
dealings with new-fangled daylight time schemes. As I did so it seemed to me 3
that I was likewise turning the calendar back a century. 3
3
3
3
956 3
3
3
3
The train kept close to the river, and across in New Hampshire I could see the 3
approaching slope of steep Wantastiquet, about which singular old legends 3
cluster. Then streets appeared on my left, and a green island showed in the 3
stream on my right. People rose and filed to the door, and I followed them. The 3
car stopped, and I alighted beneath the long train-shed of the Brattleboro station. 3
3
Looking over the line of waiting motors I hesitated a moment to see which one 3
might turn out to be the Akeley Ford, but my identity was divined before I could 3
take the initiative. And yet it was clearly not Akeley himself who advanced to 3
meet me with an outstretched hand and a mellowly phrased query as to whether 3
I was indeed Mr. Albert N. Wilmarth of Arkham. This man bore no resemblance 3
to the bearded, grizzled Akeley of the snapshot; but was a younger and more 3
urbane person, fashionably dressed, and wearing only a small, dark moustache. 3
His cultivated voice held an odd and almost disturbing hint of vague familiarity, 3
though I could not definitely place it in my memory. 3
3
As I surveyed him I heard him explaining that he was a friend of my prospective 3
host's who had come down from Townshend in his stead. Akeley, he declared, 3
had suffered a sudden attack of some asthmatic trouble, and did not feel equal to 3
making a trip in the outdoor air. It was not serious, however, and there was to be 3
no change in plans regarding my visit. I could not make out just how much this 3
Mr. Noyes - as he announced himself - knew of Akeley's researches and 3
discoveries, though it seemed to me that his casual manner stamped him as a 3
comparative outsider. Remembering what a hermit Akeley had been, I was a 3
trifle surprised at the ready availability of such a friend; but did not let my 3
puzzlement deter me from entering the motor to which he gestured me. It was 3
not the small ancient car I had expected from Akeley's descriptions, but a large 3
and immaculate specimen of recent pattern - apparently Noyes's own, and 3
bearing Massachusetts license plates with the amusing "sacred codfish" device of 3
that year. My guide, I concluded, must be a summer transient in the Townshend 3
region. 3
3
Noyes climbed into the car beside me and started it at once. I was glad that he 3
did not overflow with conversation, for some peculiar atmospheric tensity made 3
me feel disinclined to talk. The town seemed very attractive in the afternoon 3
sunlight as we swept up an incline and turned to the right into the main street. It 3
drowsed like the older New England cities which one remembers from boyhood, 3
and something in the collocation of roofs and steeples and chimneys and brick 3
walls formed contours touching deep viol- strings of ancestral emotion. I could 3
tell that I was at the gateway of a region half-bewitched through the piling-up of 3
unbroken time-accumulations; a region where old, strange things have had a 3
chance to grow and linger because they have never been stirred up. 3
3
3

3
3
3
As we passed out of Brattleboro my sense of constraint and foreboding 3
increased, for a vague quality in the hill-crowded countryside with its towering, 3
threatening, close-pressing green and granite slopes hinted at obscure secrets and 3
immemorial survivals which might or might not be hostile to mankind. For a 3
time our course followed a broad, shallow river which flowed down from 3
unknown hills in the north, and I shivered when my companion told me it was 3
the West River. It was in this stream, I recalled from newspaper items, that one of 3
the morbid crablike beings had been seen floating after the floods. 3
3
Gradually the country around us grew wilder and more deserted. Archaic 3
covered bridges lingered fearsomely out of the past in pockets of the hills, and 3
the half-abandoned railway track paralleling the river seemed to exhale a 3
nebulously visible air of desolation. There were awesome sweeps of vivid valley 3
where great cliffs rose. New England's virgin granite showing grey and austere 3
through the verdure that scaled the crests. There were gorges where untamed 3
streams leaped, bearing down toward the river the unimagined secrets of a 3
thousand pathless peaks. Branching away now and then were narrow, half- 3
concealed roads that bored their way through solid, luxuriant masses of forest 3
among whose primal trees whole armies of elemental spirits might well lurk. As 3
I saw these I thought of how Akeley had been molested by unseen agencies on 3
his drives along this very route, and did not wonder that such things could be. 3
3
The quaint, sightly village of Newfane, reached in less than an hour, was our last 3
link with that world which man can definitely call his own by virtue of conquest 3
and complete occupancy. After that we cast off all allegiance to immediate, 3
tangible, and time-touched things, and entered a fantastic world of hushed 3
unreality in which the narrow, ribbon-like road rose and fell and curved with an 3
almost sentient and purposeful caprice amidst the tenantless green peaks and 3
half-deserted valleys. Except for the sound of the motor, and the faint stir of the 3
few lonely farms we passed at infrequent intervals, the only thing that reached 3
my ears was the gurgling, insidious trickle of strange waters from numberless 3
hidden fountains in the shadowy woods. 3
3
The nearness and intimacy of the dwarfed, domed hills now became veritably 3
breath-taking. Their steepness and abruptness were even greater than I had 3
imagined from hearsay, and suggested nothing in common with the prosaic 3
objective world we know. The dense, unvisited woods on those inaccessible 3
slopes seemed to harbour alien and incredible things, and I felt that the very 3
outline of the hills themselves held some strange and aeon-forgotten meaning, as 3
if they were vast hieroglyphs left by a rumoured titan race whose glories live 3
only in rare, deep dreams. All the legends of the past, and all the stupefying 3
imputations of Henry Akeley's letters and exhibits, welled up in my memory to 3
heighten the atmosphere of tension and growing menace. The purpose of my 3
3
3
3
958 3
3
3
3
visit, and the frightful abnormahties it postulated struck at me all at once with a 3
chill sensation that nearly over-balanced my ardour for strange delvings. 3
3
My guide must have noticed my disturbed attitude; for as the road grew wilder 3
and more irregular, and our motion slower and more jolting, his occasional 3
pleasant comments expanded into a steadier flow of discourse. He spoke of the 3
beauty and weirdness of the country, and revealed some acquaintance with the 3
folklore studies of my prospective host. From his polite questions it was obvious 3
that he knew I had come for a scientific purpose, and that I was bringing data of 3
some importance; but he gave no sign of appreciating the depth and awfulness of 3
the knowledge which Akeley had finally reached. 3
3
His manner was so cheerful, normal, and urbane that his remarks ought to have 3
calmed and reassured me; but oddly enough. I felt only the more disturbed as we 3
bumped and veered onward into the unknown wilderness of hills and woods. At 3
times it seemed as if he were pumping me to see what I knew of the monstrous 3
secrets of the place, and with every fresh utterance that vague, teasing, baffling 3
familiarity in his voice increased. It was not an ordinary or healthy familiarity 3
despite the thoroughly wholesome and cultivated nature of the voice. I somehow 3
linked it with forgotten nightmares, and felt that I might go mad if I recognised 3
it. If any good excuse had existed, I think I would have turned back from my 3
visit. As it was, I could not well do so - and it occurred to me that a cool, 3
scientific conversation with Akeley himself after my arrival would help greatly 3
to pull me together. 3
3
Besides, there was a strangely calming element of cosmic beauty in the hypnotic 3
landscape through which we climbed and plunged fantastically. Time had lost 3
itself in the labyrinths behind, and around us stretched only the flowering waves 3
of faery and the recaptured loveliness of vanished centuries - the hoary groves, 3
the untainted pastures edged with gay autumnal blossoms, and at vast intervals 3
the small brown farmsteads nestling amidst huge trees beneath vertical 3
precipices of fragrant brier and meadow-grass. Even the sunlight assumed a 3
supernal glamour, as if some special atmosphere or exhalation mantled the 3
whole region. I had seen nothing like it before save in the magic vistas that 3
sometimes form the backgrounds of Italian primitives. Sodoma and Leonardo 3
conceived such expanses, but only in the distance, and through the vaultings of 3
Renaissance arcades. We were now burrowing bodily through the midst of the 3
picture, and I seemed to find in its necromancy a thing I had innately known or 3
inherited and for which I had always been vainly searching. 3
3
Suddenly, after rounding an obtuse angle at the top of a sharp ascent, the car 3
came to a standstill. On my left, across a well-kept lawn which stretched to the 3
road and flaunted a border of whitewashed stones, rose a white, two-and-a-half- 3
3
3
3
959 3
3
3
3
story house of unusual size and elegance for the region, with a congenes of 3
contiguous or arcade-linked barns, sheds, and windmill behind and to the right. I 3
recognised it at once from the snapshot I had received, and was not surprised to 3
see the name of Henry Akeley on the galvanised-iron mailbox near the road. For 3
some distance back of the house a level stretch of marshy and sparsely-wooded 3
land extended, beyond which soared a steep, thickly-forested hillside ending in a 3
jagged leafy crest. This latter, I knew, was the summit of Dark Mountain, half 3
way up which we must have climbed already. 3
3
Alighting from the car and taking my valise, Noyes asked me to wait while he 3
went in and notified Akeley of my advent. He himself, he added, had important 3
business elsewhere, and could not stop for more than a moment. As he briskly 3
walked up the path to the house I climbed out of the car myself, wishing to 3
stretch my legs a little before settling down to a sedentary conversation. My 3
feeling of nervousness and tension had risen to a maximum again now that I was 3
on the actual scene of the morbid beleaguering described so hauntingly in 3
Akeley's letters, and I honestly dreaded the coming discussions which were to 3
link me with such alien and forbidden worlds. 3
3
Close contact with the utterly bizarre is often more terrifying than inspiring, and 3
it did not cheer me to think that this very bit of dusty road was the place where 3
those monstrous tracks and that foetid green ichor had been found after 3
moonless nights of fear and death. Idly I noticed that none of Akeley's dogs 3
seemed to be about. Had he sold them all as soon as the Outer Ones made peace 3
with him? Try as I might, I could not have the same confidence in the depth and 3
sincerity of that peace which appeared in Akeley's final and queerly different 3
letter. After all, he was a man of much simplicity and with little worldly 3
experience. Was there not, perhaps, some deep and sinister undercurrent 3
beneath the surface of the new alliance? 3
3
Led by my thoughts, my eyes turned downward to the powdery road surface 3
which had held such hideous testimonies. The last few days had been dry, and 3
tracks of all sorts cluttered the rutted, irregular highway despite the 3
unfrequented nature of the district. With a vague curiosity I began to trace the 3
outline of some of the heterogeneous impressions, trying meanwhile to curb the 3
flights of macabre fancy which the place and its memories suggested. There was 3
something menacing and uncomfortable in the funereal stillness, in the muffled, 3
subtle trickle of distant brooks, and in the crowding green peaks and black- 3
wooded precipices that choked the narrow horizon. 3
3
And then an image shot into my consciousness which made those vague 3
menaces and flights of fancy seem mild and insignificant indeed. I have said that 3
I was scanning the miscellaneous prints in the road with a kind of idle curiosity - 3
3
3
3
960 3
3
3
3
but all at once that curiosity was shockingly snuffed out by a sudden and 3
paralysing gust of active terror. For though the dust tracks were in general 3
confused and overlapping, and unlikely to arrest any casual gaze, my restless 3
vision had caught certain details near the spot where the path to the house joined 3
the highway; and had recognised beyond doubt or hope the frightful significance 3
of those details. It was not for nothing, alas, that I had pored for hours over the 3
Kodak views of the Outer Ones' claw-prints which Akeley had sent. Too well did 3
I know the marks of those loathsome nippers, and that hint of ambiguous 3
direction which stamped the horrors as no creatures of this planet. No chance 3
had been left me for merciful mistake. Here, indeed, in objective form before my 3
own eyes, and surely made not many hours ago, were at least three marks which 3
stood out blasphemously among the surprising plethora of blurred footprints 3
leading to and from the Akeley farmhouse. They were the hellish tracks of the 3
living fungi from Yuggoth. 3
3
I pulled myself together in time to stifle a scream. After all, what more was there 3
than I might have expected, assuming that I had really believed Akeley's letters? 3
He had spoken of making peace with the things. Why, then, was it strange that 3
some of them had visited his house? But the terror was stronger than the 3
reassurance. Could any man be expected to look unmoved for the first time upon 3
the claw-marks of animate beings from outer depths of space? Just then I saw 3
Noyes emerge from the door and approach with a brisk step. I must, I reflected, 3
keep command of myself, for the chances were that this genial friend knew 3
nothing of Akeley's profoundest and most stupendous probings into the 3
forbidden. 3
3
Akeley, Noyes hastened to inform me, was glad and ready to see me; although 3
his sudden attack of asthma would prevent him from being a very competent 3
host for a day or two. These spells hit him hard when they came, and were 3
always accompanied by a debilitating fever and general weakness. He never was 3
good for much while they lasted - had to talk in a whisper, and was very clumsy 3
and feeble in getting about. His feet and ankles swelled, too, so that he had to 3
bandage them like a gouty old beef-eater. Today he was in rather bad shape, so 3
that I would have to attend very largely to my own needs; but he was none the 3
less eager for conversation. I would find him in the study at the left of the front 3
hall - the room where the blinds were shut. He had to keep the sunlight out 3
when he was ill, for his eyes were very sensitive. 3
3
As Noyes bade me adieu and rode off northward in his car I began to walk 3
slowly toward the house. The door had been left ajar for me; but before 3
approaching and entering I cast a searching glance around the whole place, 3
trying to decide what had struck me as so intangibly queer about it. The barns 3
and sheds looked trimly prosaic enough, and I noticed Akeley's battered Ford in 3
3
3
3
961 3
3
3
3
its capacious, unguarded shelter. Then the secret of the queerness reached me. It 3
was the total silence. Ordinarily a farm is at least moderately murmurous from 3
its various kinds of livestock, but here all signs of life were missing. What of the 3
hens and the dogs? The cows, of which Akeley had said he possessed several, 3
might conceivably be out to pasture, and the dogs might possibly have been sold; 3
but the absence of any trace of cackling or grunting was truly singular. 3
3
I did not pause long on the path, but resolutely entered the open house door and 3
closed it behind me. It had cost me a distinct psychological effort to do so, and 3
now that I was shut inside I had a momentary longing for precipitate retreat. Not 3
that the place was in the least sinister in visual suggestion; on the contrary, I 3
thought the graceful late-colonial hallway very tasteful and wholesome, and 3
admired the evident breeding of the man who had furnished it. What made me 3
wish to flee was something very attenuated and indefinable. Perhaps it was a 3
certain odd odour which I thought I noticed - though I well knew how common 3
musty odours are in even the best of ancient farmhouses. 3
3
VII 3
3
Refusing to let these cloudy qualms overmaster me, I recalled Noyes's 3
instructions and pushed open the six-panelled, brass-latched white door on my 3
left. The room beyond was darkened as I had known before; and as I entered it I 3
noticed that the queer odour was stronger there. There likewise appeared to be 3
some faint, half-imaginary rhythm or vibration in the air. For a moment the 3
closed blinds allowed me to see very little, but then a kind of apologetic hacking 3
or whispering sound drew my attention to a great easy- chair in the farther, 3
darker corner of the room. Within its shadowy depths I saw the white blur of a 3
man's face and hands; and in a moment I had crossed to greet the figure who had 3
tried to speak. Dim though the light was, I perceived that this was indeed my 3
host. I had studied the Kodak picture repeatedly, and there could be no mistake 3
about this firm, weather-beaten face with the cropped, grizzled beard. 3
3
But as I looked again my recognition was mixed with sadness and anxiety; for 3
certainly, his face was that of a very sick man. I felt that there must be something 3
more than asthma behind that strained, rigid, immobile expression and 3
unwinking glassy stare; and realised how terribly the strain of his frightful 3
experiences must have told on him. Was it not enough to break any human being 3
- even a younger man than this intrepid delver into the forbidden? The strange 3
and sudden relief, I feared, had come too late to save him from something like a 3
general breakdown. There was a touch of the pitiful in the limp, lifeless way his 3
lean hands rested in his lap. He had on a loose dressing-gown, and was swathed 3
around the head and high around the neck with a vivid yellow scarf or hood. 3
3
3
3
962 3
3
3
3
And then I saw that he was trying to talk in the same hacking whisper with 3
which he had greeted me. It was a hard whisper to catch at first, since the grey 3
moustache concealed all movements of the lips, and something in its timbre 3
disturbed me greatly; but by concentrating my attention I could soon make out 3
its purport surprisingly well. The accent was by no means a rustic one, and the 3
language was even more polished than correspondence had led me to expect. 3
3
"Mr. Wilmarth, I presume? You must pardon my not rising. I am quite ill, as Mr. 3
Noyes must have told you; but I could not resist having you come just the same. 3
You know what I wrote in my last letter - there is so much to tell you tomorrow 3
when I shall feel better. I can't say how glad I am to see you in person after all 3
our many letters. You have the file with you, of course? And the Kodak prints 3
and records? Noyes put your valise in the hall - I suppose you saw it. For tonight 3
I fear you'll have to wait on yourself to a great extent. Your room is upstairs - the 3
one over this - and you'll see the bathroom door open at the head of the staircase. 3
There's a meal spread for you in the dining-room - right through this door at 3
your right - which you can take whenever you feel like it. I'll be a better host 3
tomorrow - but just now weakness leaves me helpless. 3
3
"Make yourself at home - you might take out the letters and pictures and records 3
and put them on the table here before you go upstairs with your bag. It is here 3
that we shall discuss them - you can see my phonograph on that corner stand. 3
3
"No, thanks - there's nothing you can do for me. I know these spells of old. Just 3
come back for a little quiet visiting before night, and then go to bed when you 3
please. I'll rest right here - perhaps sleep here all night as I often do. In the 3
morning I'll be far better able to go into the things we must go into. You realise, 3
of course, the utterly stupendous nature of the matter before us. To us, as to only 3
a few men on this earth, there will be opened up gulfs of time and space and 3
knowledge beyond anything within the conception of human science or 3
philosophy. 3
3
"Do you know that Einstein is wrong, and that certain objects and forces can 3
move with a velocity greater than that of light? With proper aid I expect to go 3
backward and forward in time, and actually see and feel the earth of remote past 3
and future epochs. You can't imagine the degree to which those beings have 3
carried science. There is nothing they can't do with the mind and body of living 3
organisms. I expect to visit other planets, and even other stars and galaxies. The 3
first trip will be to Yuggoth, the nearest world fully peopled by the beings. It is a 3
strange dark orb at the very rim of our solar system - unknown to earthly 3
astronomers as yet. But I must have written you about this. At the proper time, 3
you know, the beings there will direct thought-currents toward us and cause it to 3
be discovered - or perhaps let one of their human allies give the scientists a hint. 3
3
3
3
963 3
3
3
3
"There are mighty cities on Yuggoth - great tiers of terraced towers built of black 3
stone like the specimen I tried to send you. That came from Yuggoth. The sun 3
shines there no brighter than a star, but the beings need no light. They have other 3
subtler senses, and put no windows in their great houses and temples. Light 3
even hurts and hampers and confuses them, for it does not exist at all in the black 3
cosmos outside time and space where they came from originally. To visit 3
Yuggoth would drive any weak man mad - yet I am going there. The black rivers 3
of pitch that flow under those mysterious Cyclopean bridges - things built by 3
some elder race extinct and forgotten before the beings came to Yuggoth from 3
the ultimate voids - ought to be enough to make any man a Dante or Poe if he 3
can keep sane long enough to tell what he has seen. 3
3
"But remember - that dark world of fungoid gardens and windowless cities isn't 3
really terrible. It is only to us that it would seem so. Probably this world seemed 3
just as terrible to the beings when they first explored it in the primal age. You 3
know they were here long before the fabulous epoch of Cthulhu was over, and 3
remember all about sunken R'lyeh when it was above the waters. They've been 3
inside the earth, too - there are openings which human beings know nothing of - 3
some of them in these very Vermont hills - and great worlds of unknown life 3
down there; blue-litten K'n-yan, red-litten Yoth, and black, lightless N'kai. It's 3
from N'kai that frightful Tsathoggua came - you know, the amorphous, toad-like 3
god-creature mentioned in the Pnakotic Manuscripts and the Necronomicon and 3
the Commoriom myth-cycle preserved by the Atlantean high-priest Klarkash- 3
Ton. 3
3
"But we will talk of all this later on. It must be four or five o'clock by this time. 3
Better bring the stuff from your bag, take a bite, and then come back for a 3
comfortable chat." 3
3
Very slowly I turned and began to obey my host; fetching my valise, extracting 3
and depositing the desired articles, and finally ascending to the room designated 3
as mine. With the memory of that roadside claw- print fresh in my mind, 3
Akeley's whispered paragraphs had affected me queerly; and the hints of 3
familiarity with this unknown world of fungous life - forbidden Yuggoth - made 3
my flesh creep more than I cared to own. I was tremendously sorry about 3
Akeley's illness, but had to confess that his hoarse whisper had a hateful as well 3
as pitiful quality. If only he wouldn't gloat so about Yuggoth and its black 3
secrets! 3
3
My room proved a very pleasant and well-furnished one, devoid alike of the 3
musty odour and disturbing sense of vibration; and after leaving my valise there 3
I descended again to greet Akeley and take the lunch he had set out for me. The 3
dining-room was just beyond the study, and I saw that a kitchen ell extended 3
3
3
3
964 3
3
3
3
still farther in the same direction. On the dining-table an ample array of 3
sandwiches, cake, and cheese awaited me, and a Thermos-bottle beside a cup 3
and saucer testified that hot coffee had not been forgotten. After a well-relished 3
meal I poured myself a liberal cup of coffee, but found that the culinary standard 3
had suffered a lapse in this one detail. My first spoonful revealed a faintly 3
unpleasant acrid taste, so that I did not take more. Throughout the lunch I 3
thought of Akeley sitting silently in the great chair in the darkened next room. 3
3
Once I went in to beg him to share the repast, but he whispered that he could eat 3
nothing as yet. Later on, just before he slept, he would take some malted milk - 3
all he ought to have that day. 3
3
After lunch I insisted on clearing the dishes away and washing them in the 3
kitchen sink - incidentally emptying the coffee which I had not been able to 3
appreciate. Then returning to the darkened study I drew up a chair near my 3
host's corner and prepared for such conversation as he might feel inclined to 3
conduct. The letters, pictures, and record were still on the large centre-table, but 3
for the nonce we did not have to draw upon them. Before long I forgot even the 3
bizarre odour and curious suggestions of vibration. 3
3
I have said that there were things in some of Akeley's letters - especially the 3
second and most voluminous one - which I would not dare to quote or even form 3
into words on paper. This hesitancy applies with still greater force to the things I 3
heard whispered that evening in the darkened room among the lonely hills. Of 3
the extent of the cosmic horrors unfolded by that raucous voice I cannot even 3
hint. He had known hideous things before, but what he had learned since 3
making his pact with the Outside Things was almost too much for sanity to bear. 3
Even now I absolutely refused to believe what he implied about the constitution 3
of ultimate infinity, the juxtaposition of dimensions, and the frightful position of 3
our known cosmos of space and time in the unending chain of linked cosmos- 3
atoms which makes up the immediate super- cosmos of curves, angles, and 3
material and semi-material electronic organisation. 3
3
Never was a sane man more dangerously close to the arcana of basic entity - 3
never was an organic brain nearer to utter annihilation in the chaos that 3
transcends form and force and symmetry. I learned whence Cthulhu first came, 3
and why half the great temporary stars of history had flared forth. I guessed - 3
from hints which made even my informant pause timidly - the secret behind the 3
Magellanic Clouds and globular nebulae, and the black truth veiled by the 3
immemorial allegory of Tao. The nature of the Doels was plainly revealed, and I 3
was told the essence (though not the source) of the Hounds of Tindalos. The 3
legend of Yig, Father of Serpents, remained figurative no longer, and I started 3
with loathing when told of the monstrous nuclear chaos beyond angled space 3
3
3
3
965 3
3
3
3
which the Necronomicon had mercifully cloaked under the name of Azathoth. It 3
was shocking to have the foulest nightmares of secret myth cleared up in 3
concrete terms whose stark, morbid hatefulness exceeded the boldest hints of 3
ancient and mediaeval mystics. Ineluctably I was led to believe that the first 3
whisperers of these accursed tales must have had discourse with Akeley's Outer 3
Ones, and perhaps have visited outer cosmic realms as Akeley now proposed 3
visiting them. 3
3
I was told of the Black Stone and what it implied, and was glad that it had not 3
reached me. My guesses about those hieroglyphics had been all too correct! And 3
yet Akeley now seemed reconciled to the whole fiendish system he had stumbled 3
upon; reconciled and eager to probe farther into the monstrous abyss. I 3
wondered what beings he had talked with since his last letter to me, and whether 3
many of them had been as human as that first emissary he had mentioned. The 3
tension in my head grew insufferable, and I built up all sorts of wild theories 3
about that queer, persistent odour and those insidious hints of vibration in the 3
darkened room. 3
3
Night was falling now, and as I recalled what Akeley had written me about those 3
earlier nights I shuddered to think there would be no moon. Nor did I like the 3
way the farmhouse nestled in the lee of that colossal forested slope leading up to 3
Dark Mountain's unvisited crest. With Akeley's permission I lighted a small oil 3
lamp, turned it low, and set it on a distant bookcase beside the ghostly bust of 3
Milton; but afterward I was sorry I had done so, for it made my host's strained, 3
immobile face and listless hands look damnably abnormal and corpselike. He 3
seemed half-incapable of motion, though I saw him nod stiffly once in awhile. 3
3
After what he had told, I could scarcely imagine what profounder secrets he was 3
saving for the morrow; but at last it developed that his trip to Yuggoth and 3
beyond - and my own possible participation in it - was to be the next day's topic. 3
He must have been amused by the start of horror I gave at hearing a cosmic 3
voyage on my part proposed, for his head wabbled violently when I showed my 3
fear. Subsequently he spoke very gently of how human beings might accomplish 3
- and several times had accomplished - the seemingly impossible flight across the 3
interstellar void. It seemed that complete human bodies did not indeed make the 3
trip, but that the prodigious surgical, biological, chemical, and mechanical skill of 3
the Outer Ones had found a way to convey human brains without their 3
concomitant physical structure. 3
3
There was a harmless way to extract a brain, and a way to keep the organic 3
residue alive during its absence. The bare, compact cerebral matter was then 3
immersed in an occasionally replenished fluid within an ether-tight cylinder of a 3
metal mined in Yuggoth, certain electrodes reaching through and connecting at 3

will with elaborate instruments capable of duplicating the three vital faculties of 3
sight, hearing, and speech. For the winged fungus-beings to carry the brain- 3
cylinders intact through space was an easy matter. Then, on every planet covered 3
by their civilisation, they would find plenty of adjustable faculty- instruments 3
capable of being connected with the encased brains; so that after a little fitting 3
these travelling intelligences could be given a full sensory and articulate life - 3
albeit a bodiless and mechanical one - at each stage of their journeying through 3
and beyond the space-time continuum. It was as simple as carrying a 3
phonograph record about and playing it wherever a phonograph of 3
corresponding make exists. Of its success there could be no question. Akeley was 3
not afraid. Had it not been brilliantly accomplished again and again? 3
3
For the first time one of the inert, wasted hands raised itself and pointed stiffly to 3
a high shelf on the farther side of the room. There, in a neat row, stood more than 3
a dozen cylinders of a metal I had never seen before - cylinders about a foot high 3
and somewhat less in diameter, with three curious sockets set in an isosceles 3
triangle over the front convex surface of each. One of them was linked at two of 3
the sockets to a pair of singular-looking machines that stood in the background. 3
Of their purport I did not need to be told, and I shivered as with ague. Then I 3
saw the hand point to a much nearer corner where some intricate instruments 3
with attached cords and plugs, several of them much like the two devices on the 3
shelf behind the cylinders, were huddled together. 3
3
"There are four kinds of instruments here, Wilmarth," whispered the voice. 3
"Four kinds - three faculties each - makes twelve pieces in all. You see there are 3
four different sorts of beings represented in those cylinders up there. Three 3
humans, six fungoid beings who can't navigate space corporeally, two beings 3
from Neptune (God! if you could see the body this type has on its own planet!), 3
and the rest entities from the central caverns of an especially interesting dark star 3
beyond the galaxy. In the principal outpost inside Round Hill you'll now and 3
then find more cylinders and machines - cylinders of extra-cosmic brains with 3
different senses from any we know - allies and explorers from the uttermost 3
Outside - and special machines for giving them impressions and expression in 3
the several ways suited at once to them and to the comprehensions of different 3
types of listeners. Round Hill, like most of the beings' main outposts all through 3
the various universes, is a very cosmopolitan place. Of course, only the more 3
common types have been lent to me for experiment. 3
3
"Here - take the three machines I point to and set them on the table. That tall one 3
with the two glass lenses in front - then the box with the vacuum tubes and 3
sounding-board - and now the one with the metal disc on top. Now for the 3
cylinder with the label 'B-67' pasted on it. Just stand in that Windsor chair to 3
reach the shelf. Heavy? Never mind! Be sure of the number - B-67. Don't bother 3
3
3
3
967 3
3
3
3
that fresh, shiny cyHnder joined to the two testing instruments - the one with my 3
name on it. Set B-67 on the table near where you've put the machines - and see 3
that the dial switch on all three machines is jammed over to the extreme left. 3
3
"Now connect the cord of the lens machine with the upper socket on the cylinder 3
3
- there! Join the tube machine to the lower left-hand socket, and the disc 3
apparatus to the outer socket. Now move all the dial switches on the machine 3
over to the extreme right - first the lens one, then the disc one, and then the tube 3
one. That's right. I might as well tell you that this is a human being - just like any 3
of us. I'll give you a taste of some of the others tomorrow." 3
3
To this day I do not know why I obeyed those whispers so slavishly, or whether I 3
thought Akeley was mad or sane. After what had gone before, I ought to have 3
been prepared for anything; but this mechanical mummery seemed so like the 3
typical vagaries of crazed inventors and scientists that it struck a chord of doubt 3
which even the preceding discourse had not excited. What the whisperer implied 3
was beyond all human belief - yet were not the other things still farther beyond, 3
and less preposterous only because of their remoteness from tangible concrete 3
proof? 3
3
As my mind reeled amidst this chaos, I became conscious of a mixed grating and 3
whirring from all three of the machines lately linked to the cylinder - a grating 3
and whirring which soon subsided into a virtual noiselessness. What was about 3
to happen? Was I to hear a voice? And if so, what proof would I have that it was 3
not some cleverly concocted radio device talked into by a concealed but closely 3
watched speaker? 3
3
Even now I am unwilling to swear just what I heard, or just what phenomenon 3
really took place before me. But something certainly seemed to take place. 3
3
To be brief and plain, the machine with the tubes and sound-box began to speak, 3
and with a point and intelligence which left no doubt that the speaker was 3
actually present and observing us. The voice was loud, metallic, lifeless, and 3
plainly mechanical in every detail of its production. It was incapable of inflection 3
or expressiveness, but scraped and rattled on with a deadly precision and 3
deliberation. 3
3
"Mr. Wilmarth," it said, "I hope I do not startle you. I am a human being like 3
yourself, though my body is now resting safely under proper vitalising treatment 3
inside Round Hill, about a mile and a half east of here. I myself am here with you 3
3
- my brain is in that cylinder and I see, hear, and speak through these electronic 3
vibrators. In a week I am going across the void as I have been many times before, 3
and I expect to have the pleasure of Mr. Akeley's company. I wish I might have 3
3
3
3
968 3
3
3
3
yours as well; for I know you by sight and reputation, and have kept close track 3
of your correspondence with our friend. I am, of course, one of the men who 3
have become allied with the outside beings visiting our planet. I met them first in 3
the Himalayas, and have helped them in various ways. In return they have given 3
me experiences such as few men have ever had. 3
3
"Do you realise what it means when I say I have been on thirty-seven different 3
celestial bodies - planets, dark stars, and less definable objects - including eight 3
outside our galaxy and two outside the curved cosmos of space and time? All 3
this has not harmed me in the least. My brain has been removed from my body 3
by fissions so adroit that it would be crude to call the operation surgery. The 3
visiting beings have methods which make these extractions easy and almost 3
normal - and one's body never ages when the brain is out of it. The brain, I may 3
add, is virtually immortal with its mechanical faculties and a limited 3
nourishment supplied by occasional changes of the preserving fluid. 3
3
"Altogether, I hope most heartily that you will decide to come with Mr. Akeley 3
and me. The visitors are eager to know men of knowledge like yourself, and to 3
show them the great abysses that most of us have had to dream about in fanciful 3
ignorance. It may seem strange at first to meet them, but I know you will be 3
above minding that. I think Mr. Noyes will go along, too - the man who 3
doubtless brought you up here in his car. He has been one of us for years - I 3
suppose you recognised his voice as one of those on the record Mr. Akeley sent 3
you." 3
3
At my violent start the speaker paused a moment before concluding. "So Mr. 3
Wilmarth, I will leave the matter to you; merely adding that a man with your 3
love of strangeness and folklore ought never to miss such a chance as this. There 3
is nothing to fear. All transitions are painless; and there is much to enjoy in a 3
wholly mechanised state of sensation. When the electrodes are disconnected, one 3
merely drops off into a sleep of especially vivid and fantastic dreams. 3
3
"And now, if you don't mind, we might adjourn our session till tomorrow. Good 3
night - just turn all the switches back to the left; never mind the exact order, 3
though you might let the lens machine be last. Good night, Mr. Akeley - treat our 3
guest well! Ready now with those switches?" 3
3
That was all. I obeyed mechanically and shut off all three switches, though dazed 3
with doubt of everything that had occurred. My head was still reeling as I heard 3
Akeley's whispering voice telling me that I might leave all the apparatus on the 3
table just as it was. He did not essay any comment on what had happened, and 3
indeed no comment could have conveyed much to my burdened faculties. I 3
heard him telling me I could take the lamp to use in my room, and deduced that 3
3
3
3
969 3
3
3
3
he wished to rest alone in the dark. It was surely time he rested, for his discourse 3
of the afternoon and evening had been such as to exhaust even a vigorous man. 3
Still dazed, I bade my host good night and went upstairs with the lamp, although 3
I had an excellent pocket flashlight with me. 3
3
I was glad to be out of that downstairs study with the queer odour and vague 3
suggestions of vibration, yet could not of course escape a hideous sense of dread 3
and peril and cosmic abnormality as I thought of the place I was in and the forces 3
I was meeting. The wild, lonely region, the black, mysteriously forested slope 3
towering so close behind the house; the footprint in the road, the sick, motionless 3
whisperer in the dark, the hellish cylinders and machines, and above all the 3
invitations to strange surgery and stranger voyagings - these things, all so new 3
and in such sudden succession, rushed in on me with a cumulative force which 3
sapped my will and almost undermined my physical strength. 3
3
To discover that my guide Noyes was the human celebrant in that monstrous 3
bygone Sabbat-ritual on the phonograph record was a particular shock, though I 3
had previously sensed a dim, repellent familiarity in his voice. Another special 3
shock came from my own attitude toward my host whenever I paused to analyse 3
it; for much as I had instinctively liked Akeley as revealed in his correspondence, 3
I now found that he filled me with a distinct repulsion. His illness ought to have 3
excited my pity; but instead, it gave me a kind of shudder. He was so rigid and 3
inert and corpselike - and that incessant whispering was so hateful and 3
unhuman! 3
3
It occurred to me that this whispering was different from anything else of the 3
kind I had ever heard; that, despite the curious motionlessness of the speaker's 3
moustache-screened lips, it had a latent strength and carrying-power remarkable 3
for the wheezing of an asthmatic. I had been able to understand the speaker 3
when wholly across the room, and once or twice it had seemed to me that the 3
faint but penetrant sounds represented not so much weakness as deliberate 3
repression - for what reason I could not guess. From the first I had felt a 3
disturbing quality in their timbre. Now, when I tried to weigh the matter, I 3
thought I could trace this impression to a kind of subconscious familiarity like 3
that which had made Noyes's voice so hazily ominous. But when or where I had 3
encountered the thing it hinted at, was more than I could tell. 3
3
One thing was certain - I would not spend another night here. My scientific zeal 3
had vanished amidst fear and loathing, and I felt nothing now but a wish to 3
escape from this net of morbidity and unnatural revelation. I knew enough now. 3
It must indeed be true that strange cosmic linkages do exist - but such things are 3
surely not meant for normal human beings to meddle with. 3
3
3
3
970 3
3
3
3
Blasphemous influences seemed to surround me and press chokingly upon my 3
senses. Sleep, I decided, would be out of the question; so I merely extinguished 3
the lamp and threw myself on the bed fully dressed. No doubt it was absurd, but 3
I kept ready for some unknown emergency; gripping in my right hand the 3
revolver I had brought along, and holding the pocket flashlight in my left. Not a 3
sound came from below, and I could imagine how my host was sitting there with 3
cadaverous stiffness in the dark. 3
3
Somewhere I heard a clock ticking, and was vaguely grateful for the normality of 3
the sound. It reminded me, though, of another thing about the region which 3
disturbed me - the total absence of animal life. There were certainly no farm 3
beasts about, and now I realised that even the accustomed night-noises of wild 3
living things were absent. Except for the sinister trickle of distant unseen waters, 3
that stillness was anomalous - interplanetary - and I wondered what star- 3
spawned, intangible blight could be hanging over the region. I recalled from old 3
legends that dogs and other beasts had always hated the Outer Ones, and 3
thought of what those tracks in the road might mean. 3
3
VIII 3
3
Do not ask me how long my unexpected lapse into slumber lasted, or how much 3
of what ensued was sheer dream. If I tell you that I awakened at a certain time, 3
and heard and saw certain things, you will merely answer that I did not wake 3
then; and that everything was a dream until the moment when I rushed out of 3
the house, stumbled to the shed where I had seen the old Ford, and seized that 3
ancient vehicle for a mad, aimless race over the haunted hills which at last 3
landed me - after hours of jolting and winding through forest-threatened 3
labyrinths - in a village which turned out to be Townshend. 3
3
You will also, of course, discount everything else in my report; and declare that 3
all the pictures, record- sounds, cylinder-and-machine sounds, and kindred 3
evidences were bits of pure deception practiced on me by the missing Henry 3
Akeley. You will even hint that he conspired with other eccentrics to carry out a 3
silly and elaborate hoax - that he had the express shipment removed at Keene, 3
and that he had Noyes make that terrifying wax record. It is odd, though, that 3
Noyes has not ever yet' been identified; that he was unknown at any of the 3
villages near Akeley's place, though he must have been frequently in the region. 3
I wish I had stopped to memorize the license-number of his car - or perhaps it is 3
better after all that I did not. For I, despite all you can say, and despite all I 3
sometimes try to say to myself, know that loathsome outside influences must be 3
lurking there in the half-unknown hills - and that, those influences have spies 3
and emissaries in the world of men. To keep as far as possible from such 3
influences and such emissaries is all that I ask of life in future. 3
3
3
3

3
When my frantic story sent a sheriff's posse out to the farmhouse, Akeley was 3
gone without leaving a trace. His loose dressing gown, yellow scarf, and foot- 3
bandages lay on the study floor near his corner, easy-chair, and it could not be 3
decided whether any of his other apparel had vanished with him. The dogs and 3
livestock were indeed missing, and there were some curious bullet-holes both on 3
the house's exterior and on some of the walls within; but beyond this nothing 3
unusual could be detected. No cylinders or machines, none of the evidences I 3
had brought in my valise, no queer odour or vibration-sense, no foot- prints in 3
the road, and none of the problematical things I glimpsed at the very last. 3
3
I stayed a week in Brattleboro after my escape, making inquiries among people 3
of every kind who had known Akeley; and the results convince me that the 3
matter is no figment of dream or delusion.' Akeley's queer purchase of dogs and 3
ammunition and chemicals, and the cutting of his telephone wires, are matters of 3
record; while all who knew him - including his son in California - concede that 3
his occasional remarks on strange studies had a certain consistency. Solid citizens 3
believe he was mad, and unhesitatingly pronounce all reported evidences mere 3
hoaxes devised with insane cunning and perhaps abetted by eccentric associates; 3
but the lowlier country folk sustain his statements in every detail. He had 3
showed some of these rustics his photographs and black stone, and had played 3
the hideous record for them; and they all said the footprints and buzzing voice 3
were like those described in ancestral legends. 3
3
They said, too, that suspicious sights and sounds had been noticed increasingly 3
around Akeley's house after he found the black stone, and that the place was 3
now avoided by everybody except the mail man and other casual, tough-minded 3
people. Dark Mountain and Round Hill were both notoriously haunted spots, 3
and I could find no one who had ever closely explored either. Occasional 3
disappearances of natives throughout the district's history were well attested, 3
and these now included the semi-vagabond Walter Brown, whom Akeley's 3
letters had mentioned. I even came upon one farmer who thought he had 3
personally glimpsed one of the queer bodies at flood-time in the swollen West 3
River, but his tale was too confused to be really valuable. 3
3
When I left Brattleboro I resolved never to go back to Vermont, and I feel quite 3
certain I shall keep my resolution. Those wild hills are surely the outpost of a 3
frightful cosmic race - as I doubt all the less since reading that a new ninth planet 3
has been glimpsed beyond Neptune, just as those influences had said it would be 3
glimpsed. Astronomers, with a hideous appropriateness they little suspect, have 3
named this thing "Pluto." I feel, beyond question, that it is nothing less than 3
nighted Yuggoth - and I shiver when I try to figure out the real reason why its 3
monstrous denizens wish it to be known in this way at this especial time. I vainly 3
3
3
3
972 3
3
3
3
try to assure myself that these daemoniac creatures are not gradually leading up 3
to some new policy hurtful to the earth and its normal inhabitants. 3
3
But I have still to tell of the ending of that terrible night in the farmhouse. As I 3
have said, I did finally drop into a troubled doze; a doze filled with bits of dream 3
which involved monstrous landscape-glimpses. Just what awaked me I cannot 3
yet say, but that I did indeed awake at this given point I feel very certain. My 3
first confused impression was of stealthily creaking floor-boards in the hall 3
outside my door, and of a clumsy, muffled fumbling at the latch. This, however, 3
ceased almost at once; so that my really clear impressions begin with the voices 3
heard from the study below. There seemed to be several speakers, and I judged 3
that they were controversially engaged. 3
3
By the time I had listened a few seconds I was broad awake, for the nature of the 3
voices was such as to make all thought of sleep ridiculous. The tones were 3
curiously varied, and no one who had listened to that accursed phonograph 3
record could harbour any doubts about the nature of at least two of them. 3
Hideous though the idea was, I knew that I was under the same roof with 3
nameless things from abysmal space; for those two voices were unmistakably the 3
blasphemous buzzings which the Outside Beings used in their communication 3
with men. The two were individually different - different in pitch, accent, and 3
tempo - but they were both of the same damnable general kind. 3
3
A third voice was indubitably that of a mechanical utterance-machine connected 3
with one of the detached brains in the cylinders. There was as little doubt about 3
that as about the buzzings; for the loud, metallic, lifeless voice of the previous 3
evening, with its inflectionless, expressionless scraping and rattling, and its 3
impersonal precision and deliberation, had been utterly unforgettable. For a time 3
I did not pause to question whether the intelligence behind the scraping was the 3
identical one which had formerly talked to me; but shortly afterward I reflected 3
that any brain would emit vocal sounds of the same quality if linked to the same 3
mechanical speech-producer; the only possible differences being in language, 3
rhythm, speed, and pronunciation. To complete the eldritch colloquy there were 3
two actually human voices - one the crude speech of an unknown and evidently 3
rustic man, and the other the suave Bostonian tones of my erstwhile guide 3
Noyes. 3
3
As I tried to catch the words which the stoutly-fashioned floor so bafflingly 3
intercepted, I was also conscious of a great deal of stirring and scratching and 3
shuffling in the room below; so that I could not escape the impression that it was 3
full of living beings - many more than the few whose speech I could single out. 3
The exact nature of this stirring is extremely hard to describe, for very few good 3
bases of comparison exist. Objects seemed now and then to move across the 3
3
3
3
973 3
3
3
3
room like conscious entities; the sound of their footfalls having something about 3
it like a loose, hard-surfaced clattering - as of the contact of ill-coordinated 3
surfaces of horn or hard rubber. It was, to use a more concrete but less accurate 3
comparison, as if people with loose, splintery wooden shoes were shambling and 3
rattling about on the polished board floor. Of the nature and appearance of those 3
responsible for the sounds, I did not care to speculate. 3
3
Before long I saw that it would be impossible to distinguish any connected 3
discourse. Isolated words - including the names of Akeley and myself - now and 3
then floated up, especially when uttered by the mechanical speech-producer; but 3
their true significance was lost for want of continuous context. Today I refuse to 3
form any definite deductions from them, and even their frightful effect on me 3
was one of suggestion rather than of revelation. A terrible and abnormal 3
conclave, I felt certain, was assembled below me; but for what shocking 3
deliberations I could not tell. It was curious how this unquestioned sense of the 3
malign and the blasphemous pervaded me despite Akeley's assurances of the 3
Outsider's friendliness. 3
3
With patient listening I began to distinguish clearly between voices, even though 3
I could not grasp much of what any of the voices said. I seemed to catch certain 3
typical emotions behind some of the speakers. One of the buzzing voices, for 3
example, held an unmistakable note of authority; whilst the mechanical voice, 3
notwithstanding its artificial loudness and regularity, seemed to be in a position 3
of subordination and pleading. Noyes's tones exuded a kind of conciliatory 3
atmosphere. The others I could make no attempt to interpret. I did not hear the 3
familiar whisper of Akeley, but well knew that such a sound could never 3
penetrate the solid flooring of my room. 3
3
I will try to set down some of the few disjointed words and other sounds I 3
caught, labelling the speakers of the words as best I know how. It was from the 3
speech-machine that I first picked up a few recognisable phrases. 3

3
That is the substance of what my ears brought me as I lay rigid upon that strange 3
upstairs bed in the haunted farmhouse among the daemoniac hills - lay there 3
fully dressed, with a revolver clenched in my right hand and a pocket flashlight 3
gripped in my left. I became, as I have said, broad awake; but a kind of obscure 3
paralysis nevertheless kept me inert till long after the last echoes of the sounds 3
had died away. I heard the wooden, deliberate ticking of the ancient Connecticut 3
clock somewhere far below, and at last made out the irregular snoring of a 3
sleeper. Akeley must have dozed off after the strange session, and I could well 3
believe that he needed to do so. 3
3
Just what to think or what to do was more than I could decide After all, what had 3
I heard beyond things which previous information might have led me to expect? 3
Had I not known that the nameless Outsiders were now freely admitted to the 3
farmhouse? No doubt Akeley had been surprised by an unexpected visit from 3
them. Yet something in that fragmentary discourse had chilled me 3
immeasurably, raised the most grotesque and horrible doubts, and made me 3
wish fervently that I might wake up and prove everything a dream. I think my 3
subconscious mind must have caught something which my consciousness has 3
3
3
3
975 3
3
3
3
not yet recognised. But what of Akeley? Was he not my friend, and would he not 3
have protested if any harm were meant me? The peaceful snoring below seemed 3
to cast ridicule on all my suddenly intensified fears. 3
3
Was it possible that Akeley had been imposed upon and used as a lure to draw 3
me into the hills with the letters and pictures and phonograph record? Did those 3
beings mean to engulf us both in a common destruction because we had come to 3
know too much? Again I thought of the abruptness and unnaturalness of that 3
change in the situation which must have occurred between Akeley's penultimate 3
and final letters. Something, my instinct told me, was terribly wrong. All was not 3
as it seemed. That acrid coffee which I refused - had there not been an attempt by 3
some hidden, unknown entity to drug it? I must talk to Akeley at once, and 3
restore his sense of proportion. They had hypnotised him with their promises of 3
cosmic revelations, but now he must listen to reason. We. must get out of this 3
before it would be too late. If he lacked the will power to make the break for 3
liberty. I would supply it. Or if I could not persuade him to go, I could at least go 3
myself. Surely he would let me take his Ford and leave it in a garage in 3
Brattleboro. I had noticed it in the shed - the door being left unlocked and open 3
now that peril was deemed past - and I believed there was a good chance of its 3
being ready for instant use. That momentary dislike of Akeley which I had felt 3
during and after the evening's conversation was all gone now. He was in a 3
position much like my own, and we must stick together. Knowing his indisposed 3
condition, I hated to wake him at this juncture, but I knew that I must. I could 3
not stay in this place till morning as matters stood. 3
3
At last I felt able to act, and stretched myself vigorously to regain command of 3
my muscles. Arising with a caution more impulsive than deliberate, I found and 3
donned my hat, took my valise, and started downstairs with the flashlight's aid. 3
In my nervousness I kept the revolver clutched in my right hand, being able to 3
take care of both valise and flashlight with my left. Why I exerted these 3
precautions I do not really know, since I was even then on my way to awaken the 3
only other occupant of the house. 3
3
As I half-tiptoed down the creaking stairs to the lower hall I could hear the 3
sleeper more plainly, and noticed that he must be in the room on my left - the 3
living-room I had not entered. On my right was the gaping blackness of the 3
study in which I had heard the voices. Pushing open the unlatched door of the 3
living-room I traced a path with the flashlight toward the source of the snoring, 3
and finally turned the beams on the sleeper's face. But in the next second I hastily 3
turned them away and commenced a catlike retreat to the hall, my caution this 3
time springing from reason as well as from instinct. For the sleeper on the couch 3
was not Akeley at all, but my quondam guide Noyes. 3
3
3
3
976 3
3
3
3
Just what the real situation was, I could not guess; but common sense told me 3
that the safest thing was to find out as much as possible before arousing 3
anybody. Regaining the hall, I silently closed and latched the living-room door 3
after me; thereby lessening the chances of awakening Noyes. I now cautiously 3
entered the dark study, where I expected to find Akeley, whether asleep or 3
awake, in the great corner chair which was evidently his favorite resting-place. 3
As I advanced, the beams of my flashlight caught the great centre- table, 3
revealing one of the hellish cylinders with sight and hearing machines attached, 3
and with a speech machine standing close by, ready to be connected at any 3
moment. This, I reflected, must be the encased brain I had heard talking during 3
the frightful conference; and for a second I had a perverse impulse to attach the 3
speech machine and see what it would say. 3
3
It must, I thought, be conscious of my presence even now; since the sight and 3
hearing attachments could not fail to disclose the rays of my flashlight and the 3
faint creaking of the floor beneath my feet. But in the end I did not dare meddle 3
with the thing. I idly saw that it was the fresh shiny cylinder with Akeley's name 3
on it, which I had noticed on the shelf earlier in the evening and which my host 3
had told me not to bother. Looking back at that moment, I can only regret my 3
timidity and wish that I had boldly caused the apparatus to speak. God knows 3
what mysteries and horrible doubts and questions of identity it might have 3
cleared up! But then, it may be merciful that I let it alone. 3
3
From the table I turned my flashlight to the corner where I thought Akeley was, 3
but found to my perplexity that the great easy-chair was empty of any human 3
occupant asleep or awake. From the seat to the floor there trailed voluminously 3
the familiar old dressing-gown, and near it on the floor lay the yellow scarf and 3
the huge foot-bandages I had thought so odd. As I hesitated, striving to 3
conjecture where Akeley might be, and why he had so suddenly discarded his 3
necessary sick-room garments, I observed that the queer odour and sense of 3
vibration were no longer in the room. What had been their cause? Curiously it 3
occurred to me that I had noticed them only in Akeley's vicinity. They had been 3
strongest where he sat, and wholly absent except in the room with him or just 3
outside the doors of that room. I paused, letting the flashlight wander about the 3
dark study and racking my brain for explanations of the turn affairs had taken. 3
3
Would to Heaven I had quietly left the place before allowing that light to rest 3
again on the vacant chair. As it turned out, I did not leave quietly; but with a 3
muffled shriek which must have disturbed, though it did not quite awake, the 3
sleeping sentinel across the hall. That shriek, and Noyes's still-unbroken snore, 3
are the last sounds I ever heard in that morbidity-choked farmhouse beneath the 3
black-wooded crest of haunted mountain - that focus of transcosmic horror 3
amidst the lonely green hills and curse-muttering brooks of a spectral rustic land. 3

3
It is a wonder that I did not drop flashlight, valise, and revolver in my wild 3
scramble, but somehow I failed to lose any of these. I actually managed to get out 3
of that room and that house without making any further noise, to drag myself 3
and my belongings safely into the old Ford in the shed, and to set that archaic 3
vehicle in motion toward some unknown point of safety in the black, moonless 3
night. The ride that followed was a piece of delirium out of Poe or Rimbaud or 3
the drawings of Dore, but finally I reached Townshend. That is all. If my sanity is 3
still unshaken, I am lucky. Sometimes I fear what the years will bring, especially 3
since that new planet Pluto has been so curiously discovered. 3
3
As I have implied, I let my flashlight return to the vacant easy-chair after its 3
circuit of the room; then noticing for the first time the presence of certain objects 3
in the seat, made inconspicuous by the adjacent loose folds of the empty 3
dressing-gown. These are the objects, three in number, which the investigators 3
did not find when they came later on. As I said at the outset, there was nothing 3
of actual visual horror about them. The trouble was in what they led one to infer. 3
Even now I have my moments of half-doubt - moments in which I half-accept the 3
scepticism of those who attribute my whole experience to dream and nerves and 3
delusion. 3
3
The three things were damnably clever constructions of their kind, and were 3
furnished with ingenious metallic clamps to attach them to organic 3
developments of which I dare not form any conjecture. I hope - devoutly hope- 3
that they were the waxen products of a master artist, despite what my inmost 3
fears tell me. Great God! That whisperer in darkness with its morbid odour and 3
vibrations! Sorcerer, emissary, changeling, outsider.. . that hideous repressed 3
buzzing. . . and all the time in that fresh, shiny cylinder on the shelf. . . poor devil 3
. . . "Prodigious surgical, biological, chemical, and mechanical skill.. . 3
3
For the things in the chair, perfect to the last, subtle detail of microscopic 3
resemblance - or identity - were the face and hands of Henry Wentworth Akeley. 3

3
I am Basil Elton, keeper of the North Point light that my father and grandfather 3
kept before me. Far from the shore stands the gray lighthouse, above sunken 3
slimy rocks that are seen when the tide is low, but unseen when the tide is high. 3
Past that beacon for a century have swept the majestic barques of the seven seas. 3
In the days of my grandfather there were many; in the days of my father not so 3
many; and now there are so few that I sometimes feel strangely alone, as though 3
I were the last man on our planet. 3
3
From far shores came those white-sailed argosies of old; from far Eastern shores 3
where warm suns shine and sweet odors linger about strange gardens and gay 3
temples. The old captains of the sea came often to my grandfather and told him 3
of these things which in turn he told to my father, and my father told to me in the 3
long autumn evenings when the wind howled eerily from the East. And I have 3
read more of these things, and of many things besides, in the books men gave me 3
when I was young and filled with wonder. 3
3
But more wonderful than the lore of old men and the lore of books is the secret 3
lore of ocean. Blue, green, gray, white or black; smooth, ruffled, or mountainous; 3
that ocean is not silent. All my days have I watched it and listened to it, and I 3
know it well. At first it told to me only the plain little tales of calm beaches and 3
near ports, but with the years it grew more friendly and spoke of other things; of 3
things more strange and more distant in space and time. Sometimes at twilight 3
the gray vapors of the horizon have parted to grant me glimpses of the ways 3
beyond; and sometimes at night the deep waters of the sea have grown clear and 3
phosphorescent, to grant me glimpses of the ways beneath. And these glimpses 3
have been as often of the ways that were and the ways that might be, as of the 3
ways that are; for ocean is more ancient than the mountains, and freighted with 3
the memories and the dreams of Time. 3
3
Out of the South it was that the White Ship used to come when the moon was 3
full and high in the heavens. Out of the South it would glide very smoothly and 3
silently over the sea. And whether the sea was rough or calm, and whether the 3
wind was friendly or adverse, it would always glide smoothly and silently, its 3
sails distant and its long strange tiers of oars moving rhythmically. One night I 3
espied upon the deck a man, bearded and robed, and he seemed to beckon me to 3
3
3
3
979 3
3
3
3
embark for far unknown shores. Many times afterward I saw him under the full 3
moon, and never did he beckon me. 3
3
Very brightly did the moon shine on the night I answered the call, and I walked 3
out over the waters to the White Ship on a bridge of moonbeams. The man who 3
had beckoned now spoke a welcome to me in a soft language I seemed to know 3
well, and the hours were filled with soft songs of the oarsmen as we glided away 3
into a mysterious South, golden with the glow of that full, mellow moon. 3
3
And when the day dawned, rosy and effulgent, I beheld the green shore of far 3
lands, bright and beautiful, and to me unknown. Up from the sea rose lordly 3
terraces of verdure, tree-studded, and shewing here and there the gleaming 3
white roofs and colonnades of strange temples. As we drew nearer the green 3
shore the bearded man told me of that land, the land of Zar, where dwell all the 3
dreams and thoughts of beauty that come to men once and then are forgotten. 3
And when I looked upon the terraces again I saw that what he said was true, for 3
among the sights before me were many things I had once seen through the mists 3
beyond the horizon and in the phosphorescent depths of ocean. There too were 3
forms and fantasies more splendid than any I had ever known; the visions of 3
young poets who died in want before the world could learn of what they had 3
seen and dreamed. But we did not set foot upon the sloping meadows of Zar, for 3
it is told that he who treads them may nevermore return to his native shore. 3
3
As the White Ship sailed silently away from the templed terraces of Zar, we 3
beheld on the distant horizon ahead the spires of a mighty city; and the bearded 3
man said to me, "This is Thalarion, the City of a Thousand Wonders, wherein 3
reside all those mysteries that man has striven in vain to fathom." And I looked 3
again, at closer range, and saw that the city was greater than any city I had 3
known or dreamed of before. Into the sky the spires of its temples reached, so 3
that no man might behold their peaks; and far back beyond the horizon stretched 3
the grim, gray walls, over which one might spy only a few roofs, weird and 3
ominous, yet adorned with rich friezes and alluring sculptures. I yearned 3
mightily to enter this fascinating yet repellent city, and besought the bearded 3
man to land me at the stone pier by the huge carven gate Akariel; but he gently 3
denied my wish, saying, "Into Thalarion, the City of a Thousand Wonders, many 3
have passed but none returned. Therein walk only daemons and mad things that 3
are no longer men, and the streets are white with the unburied bones of those 3
who have looked upon the eidolon Lathi, that reigns over the city." So the White 3
Ship sailed on past the walls of Thalarion, and followed for many days a 3
southward-flying bird, whose glossy plumage matched the sky out of which it 3
had appeared. 3
3

Then came we to a pleasant coast gay with blossoms of every hue, where as far 3
inland as we could see basked lovely groves and radiant arbors beneath a 3
meridian sun. From bowers beyond our view came bursts of song and snatches 3
of lyric harmony, interspersed with faint laughter so delicious that I urged the 3
rowers onward in my eagerness to reach the scene. And the bearded man spoke 3
no word, but watched me as we approached the lily-lined shore. Suddenly a 3
wind blowing from over the flowery meadows and leafy woods brought a scent 3
at which I trembled. The wind grew stronger, and the air was filled with the 3
lethal, charnel odor of plague-stricken towns and uncovered cemeteries. And as 3
we sailed madly away from that damnable coast the bearded man spoke at last, 3
saying, "This is Xura, the Land of Pleasures Unattained." 3
3
So once more the White Ship followed the bird of heaven, over warm blessed 3
seas fanned by caressing, aromatic breezes. Day after day and night after night 3
did we sail, and when the moon was full we would listen to soft songs of the 3
oarsmen, sweet as on that distant night when we sailed away from my far native 3
land. And it was by moonlight that we anchored at last in the harbor of Sona- 3
Nyl, which is guarded by twin headlands of crystal that rise from the sea and 3
meet in a resplendent arch. This is the Land of Fancy, and we walked to the 3
verdant shore upon a golden bridge of moonbeams. 3
3
In the Land of Sona-Nyl there is neither time nor space, neither suffering nor 3
death; and there I dwelt for many aeons. Green are the groves and pastures, 3
bright and fragrant the flowers, blue and musical the streams, clear and cool the 3
fountains, and stately and gorgeous the temples, castles, and cities of Sona- Nyl. 3
Of that land there is no bound, for beyond each vista of beauty rises another 3
more beautiful. Over the countryside and amidst the splendor of cities can move 3
at will the happy folk, of whom all are gifted with unmarred grace and 3
unalloyed happiness. For the aeons that I dwelt there I wandered blissfully 3
through gardens where quaint pagodas peep from pleasing clumps of bushes, 3
and where the white walks are bordered with delicate blossoms. I climbed gentle 3
hills from whose summits I could see entrancing panoramas of loveliness, with 3
steepled towns nestling in verdant valleys, and with the golden domes of 3
gigantic cities glittering on the infinitely distant horizon. And I viewed by 3
moonlight the sparkling sea, the crystal headlands, and the placid harbor 3
wherein lay anchored the White Ship. 3
3
It was against the full moon one night in the immemorial year of Tharp that I 3
saw outlined the beckoning form of the celestial bird, and felt the first stirrings of 3
unrest. Then I spoke with the bearded man, and told him of my new yearnings to 3
depart for remote Cathuria, which no man hath seen, but which all believe to lie 3
beyond the basalt pillars of the West. It is the Land of Hope, and in it shine the 3
perfect ideals of all that we know elsewhere; or at least so men relate. But the 3
3
3
3
981 3
3
3
3
bearded man said to me, "Beware of those perilous seas wherein men say 3
Cathuria Hes. In Sona-Nyl there is no pain or death, but who can tell what lies 3
beyond the basalt pillars of the West?" Natheless at the next full moon I boarded 3
the White Ship, and with the reluctant bearded man left the happy harbor for 3
untraveled seas. 3
3
And the bird of heaven flew before, and led us toward the basalt pillars of the 3
West, but this time the oarsmen sang no soft songs under the full moon. In my 3
mind I would often picture the unknown Land of Cathuria with its splendid 3
groves and palaces, and would wonder what new delights there awaited me. 3
"Cathuria," I would say to myself, "is the abode of gods and the land of 3
unnumbered cities of gold. Its forests are of aloe and sandalwood, even as the 3
fragrant groves of Camorin, and among the trees flutter gay birds sweet with 3
song. On the green and flowery mountains of Cathuria stand temples of pink 3
marble, rich with carven and painted glories, and having in their courtyards cool 3
fountains of silver, where purr with ravishing music the scented waters that 3
come from the grotto-born river Narg. And the cities of Cathuria are cinctured 3
with golden walls, and their pavements also are of gold. In the gardens of these 3
cities are strange orchids, and perfumed lakes whose beds are of coral and 3
amber. At night the streets and the gardens are lit with gay lanthorns fashioned 3
from the three-colored shell of the tortoise, and here resound the soft notes of the 3
singer and the lutanist. And the houses of the cities of Cathuria are all palaces, 3
each built over a fragrant canal bearing the waters of the sacred Narg. Of marble 3
and porphyry are the houses, and roofed with glittering gold that reflects the 3
rays of the sun and enhances the splendor of the cities as blissful gods view them 3
from the distant peaks. Fairest of all is the palace of the great monarch Dorieb, 3
whom some say to be a demi-god and others a god. High is the palace of Dorieb, 3
and many are the turrets of marble upon its walls. In its wide halls many 3
multitudes assemble, and here hang the trophies of the ages. And the roof is of 3
pure gold, set upon tall pillars of ruby and azure, and having such carven figures 3
of gods and heroes that he who looks up to those heights seems to gaze upon the 3
living Olympus. And the floor of the palace is of glass, under which flow the 3
cunningly lighted waters of the Narg, gay with gaudy fish not known beyond the 3
bounds of lovely Cathuria." 3
3
Thus would I speak to myself of Cathuria, but ever would the bearded man warn 3
me to turn back to the happy shore of Sona-Nyl; for Sona-Nyl is known of men, 3
while none hath ever beheld Cathuria. 3
3
And on the thirty-first day that we followed the bird, we beheld the basalt pillars 3
of the West. Shrouded in mist they were, so that no man might peer beyond 3
them or see their summits — which indeed some say reach even to the heavens. 3
And the bearded man again implored me to turn back, but I heeded him not; for 3
3
3
3
982 3
3
3
3
from the mists beyond the basah pillars I fancied there came the notes of singers 3
and lutanists; sweeter than the sweetest songs of Sona-Nyl, and sounding mine 3
own praises; the praises of me, who had voyaged far from the full moon and 3
dwelt in the Land of Fancy. So to the sound of melody the White Ship sailed into 3
the mist betwixt the basalt pillars of the West. And when the music ceased and 3
the mist lifted, we beheld not the Land of Cathuria, but a swift-rushing resistless 3
sea, over which our helpless barque was borne toward some unknown goal. 3
Soon to our ears came the distant thunder of falling waters, and to our eyes 3
appeared on the far horizon ahead the titanic spray of a monstrous cataract, 3
wherein the oceans of the world drop down to abysmal nothingness. Then did 3
the bearded man say to me, with tears on his cheek, "We have rejected the 3
beautiful Land of Sona-Nyl, which we may never behold again. The gods are 3
greater than men, and they have conquered." And I closed my eyes before the 3
crash that I knew would come, shutting out the sight of the celestial bird which 3
flapped its mocking blue wings over the brink of the torrent. 3
3
Out of that crash came darkness, and I heard the shrieking of men and of things 3
which were not men. From the East tempestuous winds arose, and chilled me as 3
I crouched on the slab of damp stone which had risen beneath my feet. Then as I 3
heard another crash I opened my eyes and beheld myself upon the platform of 3
that lighthouse whence I had sailed so many aeons ago. In the darkness below 3
there loomed the vast blurred outlines of a vessel breaking up on the cruel rocks, 3
and as I glanced out over the waste I saw that the light had failed for the first 3
time since my grandfather had assumed its care. 3
3
And in the later watches of the night, when I went within the tower, I saw on the 3
wall a calendar which still remained as when I had left it at the hour I sailed 3
away. With the dawn I descended the tower and looked for wreckage upon the 3
rocks, but what I found was only this: a strange dead bird whose hue was as of 3
the azure sky, and a single shattered spar, of a whiteness greater than that of the 3
wave-tips or of the mountain snow. 3
3
And thereafter the ocean told me its secrets no more; and though many times 3
since has the moon shone full and high in the heavens, the White Ship from the 3
South came never again. 3

What the Moon Brings 3

Published May 1923 in The National Amateur, Vol. 45, No. 5, page 9 3
3
I hate the moon - I am afraid of it - for when it shines on certain scenes familiar 3
and loved it sometimes makes them unfamiliar and hideous. 3
3
It was in the spectral summer when the moon shone down on the old garden 3
where I wandered; the spectral summer of narcotic flowers and humid seas of 3
foliage that bring wild and many-coloured dreams. And as I walked by the 3
shallow crystal stream I saw unwonted ripples tipped with yellow light, as if 3
those placid waters were drawn on in resistless currents to strange oceans that 3
are not in the world. Silent and sparkling, bright and baleful, those moon-cursed 3
waters hurried I knew not whither; whilst from the embowered banks white 3
lotos-blossoms fluttered one by one in the opiate night-wind and dropped 3
despairingly into the stream, swirling away horribly under the arched, carven 3
bridge, and staring back with the sinister resignation of calm, dead faces. 3
3
And as I ran along the shore, crushing sleeping flowers with heedless feet and 3
maddened ever by the fear of unknown things and the lure of the dead faces, I 3
saw that the garden had no end under that moon; for where by day the walls 3
were, there stretched now only new vistas of trees and paths, flowers and shrubs, 3
stone idols and pagodas, and bendings of the yellow-litten stream past grassy 3
banks and under grotesque bridges of marble. And the lips of the dead lotos- 3
faces whispered sadly, and bade me follow, nor did I cease my steps till the 3
stream became a river, and joined amidst marshes of swaying reeds and beaches 3
of gleaming sand the shore of a vast and nameless sea. 3
3
Upon that sea the hateful moon shone, and over its unvocal waves weird 3
perfumes breeded. And as I saw therein the lotos-faces vanish, I longed for nets 3
that I might capture them and learn from them the secrets which the moon had 3
brought upon the night. But when that moon went over to the west and the still 3
tide ebbed from the sullen shore, I saw in that light old spires that the waves 3
almost uncovered, and white columns gay with festoons of green seaweed. And 3
knowing that to this sunken place all the dead had come, I trembled and did not 3
wish again to speak with the lotos-faces. 3
3
Yet when I saw afar out in the sea a black condor descend from the sky to seek 3
rest on a vast reef, I would fain have questioned him, and asked him of those 3
whom I had known when they were alive. This I would have asked him had he 3
3
3
3
984 3
3
3
3
not been so far away, but he was very far, and could not be seen at all when he 3
drew nigh that gigantic reef. 3
3
So I watched the tide go out under that sinking moon, and saw gleaming the 3
spires, the towers, and the roofs of that dead, dripping city. And as I watched, 3
my nostrils tried to close against the perfume- conquering stench of the world's 3
dead; for truly, in this unplaced and forgotten spot had all the flesh of the 3
churchyards gathered for puffy sea-worms to gnaw and glut upon. 3
3
Over these horrors the evil moon now hung very low, but the puffy worms of the 3
sea need no moon to feed by. And as I watched the ripples that told of the 3
writhing of worms beneath, I felt a new chill from afar out whither the condor 3
had flown, as if my flesh had caught a horror before my eyes had seen it. 3
3
Nor had my flesh trembled without cause, for when I raised my eyes I saw that 3
the waters had ebbed very low, shewing much of the vast reef whose rim I had 3
seen before. And when I saw that the reef was but the black basalt crown of a 3
shocking eikon whose monstrous forehead now shown in the dim moonlight and 3
whose vile hooves must paw the hellish ooze miles below, I shrieked and 3
shrieked lest the hidden face rise above the waters, and lest the hidden eyes look 3
at me after the slinking away of that leering and treacherous yellow moon. 3
3
And to escape this relentless thing I plunged gladly and unhesitantly into the 3
stinking shallows where amidst weedy walls and sunken streets fat sea-worms 3
feast upon the world's dead. 3

3
The drive toward Cape Girardeau had been through unfamiliar country; and as 3
the late afternoon light grew golden and half-dreamlike I realized that I must 3
have directions if I expected to reach the town before night. I did not care to be 3
wandering about these bleak southern Missouri lowlands after dark, for roads 3
were poor and the November cold rather formidable in an open roadster. Black 3
clouds, too, were massing on the horizon; so I looked about among the long, grey 3
and blue shadows that streaked the flat, brownish fields, hoping to glimpse some 3
house where I might get the needed information. 3
3
It was a lonely and deserted country, but at last I spied a roof among a clump of 3
trees near the small river on my right; perhaps a full half-mile from the road, and 3
probably reachable by some path or drive which I would presently come upon. 3
In the absence of any nearer dwelling, I resolved to try my luck there; and was 3
glad when the bushes by the roadside revealed the ruin of a carved stone 3
gateway, covered with dry, dead vines and choked with undergrowth which 3
explained why I had not been able to trace the path across the fields in my first 3
distant view. I saw that I could not drive the car in, so I parked it very carefully 3
near the gate - where a thick evergreen would shield it in case of rain - and got 3
out for the long walk to the house. 3
3
Traversing that brush-growth path in the gathering twilight I was conscious of a 3
distinct sense of foreboding, probably induced by the air of sinister decay 3
hovering about the gate and the former driveway. From the carvings on the old 3
stone pillars I inferred that this place was once an estate of manorial dignity; and 3
I could clearly see that the driveway had originally boasted guardian lines of 3
linden trees, some of which had died, while others had lost their special identity 3
among the wild scrub growths of the region. 3
3
As I ploughed onward, cockleburs and stickers clung to my clothes, and I began 3
to wonder whether the place could be inhabited after all. Was I tramping on a 3
vain errand? For a moment I was tempted to go back and try some farm farther 3
along the road, when a view of the house ahead aroused my curiosity and 3
stimulated my venturesome spirit. 3
3
There was something provocatively fascinating in the tree-girt, decrepit pile 3
before me, for it spoke of the graces and spaciousness of a bygone era and a far 3
3
3
3

3
more southerly environment. It was a typical wooden plantation house of the 3
classic, early nineteenth-century pattern, with two and a half stories and a great 3
Ionic portico whose pillars reached up as far as the attic and supported a 3
triangular pediment. Its state of decay was extreme and obvious; one of the vast 3
columns having rotted and fallen to the ground, while the upper piazza or 3
balcony had sagged dangerously low. Other buildings, I judged, had formerly 3
stood near it. 3
3
As I mounted the broad stone steps to the low porch and the carved and 3
fanlighted doorway I felt distinctly nervous, and started to light a cigarette - 3
desisting when I saw how dry and inflammable everything about me was. 3
Though now convinced that the house was deserted, I nevertheless hesitated to 3
violate its dignity without knocking; so tugged at the rusty iron knocker until I 3
could get it to move, and finally set up a cautious rapping which seemed to make 3
the whole place shake and rattle. There was no response, yet once more I plied 3
the cumbrous, creaking device - as much to dispel the sense of unholy silence 3
and solitude as to arouse any possible occupant of the ruin. 3
3
Somewhere near the river I heard the mournful not of a dove, and it seemed as if 3
the coursing water itself were faintly audible. Half in a dream, I seized and 3
rattled the ancient latch, and finally gave the great six- panelled door a frank 3
trying. It was unlocked, as I could see in a moment; and though it stuck and 3
grated on its hinges I began to push it open, stepping through it into a vast 3
shadowy hall as I did so. 3
3
But the moment I took this step I regretted it. It was not that a legion of specters 3
confronted me in that dim and dusty hall with the ghostly Empire furniture; but 3
that I knew all at once that the place was not deserted at all. There was a creaking 3
on the great curved staircase, and the sound of faltering footsteps slowly 3
descending. Then I saw a tall, bent figure silhouetted for an instant against the 3
great Palladian window on the landing. 3
3
My first start of terror was soon over, and as the figure descended the final flight 3
I was ready to greet the householder whose privacy I had invaded. In the semi- 3
darkness I could see him reach in his pocket for a match. There came a flare as he 3
lighted a small kerosene lamp which stood on a rickety console table near the 3
foot of the stairs. In the feeble glow was revealed the stooping figure of a very 3
tall, emaciated old man; disordered as to dress and unshaved as to face, yet for 3
all that with the bearing and expression of a gentleman. 3
3
I did not wait for him to speak, but at once began to explain my presence. 3
3
3
3

3
3
3
"You'll pardon my coining in like this, but when my knocking didn't raise 3
anybody I concluded that no one lived here. What I wanted originally was to 3
know the right road to Cape Girardeau - the shortest road, that is. I wanted to get 3
there before dark, but now, of course - " 3
3
As I paused, the man spoke; in exactly the cultivated tone I had expected, and 3
with a mellow accent as unmistakably Southern as the house he inhabited. 3
3
"Rather, you must pardon me for not answering your knock more promptly. I 3
live in a very retired way, and am not usually expecting visitors. At first I 3
thought you were a mere curiosity-seeker. Then when you knocked again I 3
started to answer, but I am not well and have to move very slowly. Spinal 3
neuritis - very troublesome case. 3
3
"But as for your getting to town before dark - it's plain you can't do that. The 3
road you are one - for I suppose you came from the gate - isn't the best or 3
shortest way. What you must do is to take your first left after you leave the gate - 3
that is, the first real road to your left. There are three or four cart paths you can 3
ignore, but you can't mistake the real road because of the extra large willow tree 3
on the right just opposite it. Then when you've turned, keep on past two roads 3
and turn to the right along the third. After that - " 3
3
"Please wait a moment! How can I follow all these clues in pitch darkness, 3
without ever having been near here before, and with only an indifferent pair of 3
headlights to tell me what is and what isn't a road? Besides, I think it's going to 3
storm pretty soon, and my car is an open one. It looks as if I were in a bad fix if I 3
want to get to Cape Girardeau tonight. The fact is, I don't think I'd better try to 3
make it. I don't like to impose burdens, or anything like that - but in view of the 3
circumstances, do you suppose you could put me up for the night? I won't be 3
any trouble - no meals or anything. Just let me have a corner to sleep in till 3
daylight, and I'm all right. I can leave the car in the road where it is - a bit of wet 3
weather won't hurt it if worst comes to worst." 3
3
As I made my sudden request I could see the old man's face lose its former 3
expression of quiet resignation and take on an odd, surprised look. 3
3
"Sleep - here?" 3
3
He seemed so astonished at my request that I repeated it. 3
3
"Yes, why not? I assure you I won't be any trouble. What else can I do? I'm a 3
stranger hereabouts, these roads are a labyrinth in the dark, and I'll wager it'll be 3
raining torrents outside of an hour - " 3
3
3
3
988 3
3
3
3
This time it my host's turn to interrupt, and as he did so I could feel a peculiar 3
quality in his deep, musical voice. 3
3
"A stranger - of course you must be, else you wouldn't think of sleeping here, 3
wouldn't think of coming here at all. People don't come here nowadays." 3
3
He paused, and my desire to stay was increased a thousandfold by the sense of 3
mystery his laconic words seemed to evoke. There was surely something 3
alluringly queer about this place, and the pervasive musty smell seemed to cloak 3
a thousand secrets. Again I noticed the extreme decrepitude of everything about 3
me; manifest even in the feeble rays of the single small lamp. I felt woefully 3
chilly, and saw with regret that no heating was provided, and yet so great was 3
my curiosity that I still wished most ardently to stay and learn something of the 3
recluse and his dismal abode. 3
3
"Let that be as it may," I replied. "I can't help about other people. But I surely 3
would like to have a spot to stop till daylight. Still - if people don't relish this 3
place, mayn't it be because it's getting so run-down? Of course I suppose it a take 3
a fortune to keep such an estate up, but if the burden's too great why don't you 3
look for smaller quarters? Why try to stick it out here in this way - with all the 3
hardships and discomforts?" 3
3
The man did not seem offended, but answered me very gravely. 3
3
"Surely you may stay if you really wish to - you can come to no harm that I 3
know of. But others claim there are certain peculiarly undesirable influences 3
here. As for me - 1 stay here because I have to. There is something I feel it a duty 3
to guard - something that holds me. I wish I had the money and health and 3
ambition to take decent care of the house and grounds." 3
3
With my curiosity still more heightened, I prepared to take my host at his word; 3
and followed him slowly upstairs when he motioned me to do so. It was very 3
dark now, and a faint pattering outside told me that the threatened rain had 3
come. I would have been glad of any shelter, but this was doubly welcome 3
because of the hints of mystery about the place and its master. For an incurable 3
lover of the grotesque, no more fitting haven could have been provided. 3
3
II 3
3
There was a second-floor corner room in less unkempt shape than the rest of the 3
house, and into this my host led me, setting down his small lamp and lighting a 3
somewhat larger one. From the cleanliness and contents of the room, and from 3
the books ranged along the walls, I could see that I had not guessed amiss in 3
3
3
3
989 3
3
3
3
thinking the man a gentleman of taste of breeding. He was a hermit and 3
eccentric, no doubt, but he still had standards and intellectual interests. As he 3
waved me to a seat I began a conversation on general topics, and was pleased to 3
find him not at all taciturn. If anything, he seemed glad of someone to talk, and 3
did not even attempt to swerve the discussion from personal topics. 3
3
He was, I learned, one Antoine de Russy, of an ancient, powerful, and cultivated 3
line of Louisiana planters. More than a century ago his grandfather, a younger 3
so, had migrated to southern Missouri and founded a new estate in the lavish 3
ancestral manner; building this pillared mansion and surrounding it with all the 3
accessories of a great plantation. There had been, at one time, as many as 200 3
negroes in the cabins which stood on the flat ground in the rear - ground that the 3
river had now invaded - and to hear them singing and laughing and playing the 3
banjo at night was to know the fullest charm of a civilization and social order 3
now sadly extinct. In front of the house, where the great guardian oaks and 3
willows stood, there had been a lawn like a broad green carpet, always watered 3
and trimmed and with flagstoned, flower-bordered walks curving through it. 3
"Riverside" - for such the place was called - had been a lovely and idyllic 3
homestead in its day; and my host could recall it when many traces of its best 3
period. 3
3
It was raining hard now, with dense sheets of water beating against the insecure 3
roof, walls, and windows, and sending in drops through a thousand chinks and 3
crevices. Moisture trickled down to the floor from unsuspected places, and the 3
mounting wind rattled the rotting, loose-hinged shutters outside. But I minded 3
none of this, for I saw that a story was coming. Incited to reminiscence, my host 3
made a move to shew me to sleeping-quarters; but kept on recalling the older, 3
better days. Soon, I saw, I would receive an inkling of why he lived alone in that 3
ancient place, and why his neighbours thought it full of undesirable influences. 3
His voice was very musical as he spoke on, and his tale soon took a turn which 3
left me no chance to grow drowsy. 3
3
"Yes - Riverside was built in 1816, and my father was born in 1828. He'd be over 3
a century old now if he were alive, but he died young - so young I can just barely 3
remember him. In '64 that was - he was killed in the war. Seventh Louisiana 3
Infantry C.S.A., for he went back to the old home to enlist. My grandfather was 3
too old to fight, yet he lived on to be ninety-five, and helped my mother bring me 3
up. A good bringing-up, too - I'll give them credit. We always had strong 3
traditions - high notions of honor - and my grandfather saw to it that I grew up 3
the way de Russys have grown up, generation after generation, ever since the 3
Crusades. We weren't quite wiped out financially, but managed to get on very 3
comfortable after the war. I went to a good school in Louisiana, and later to 3
3
3
3
990 3
3
3
3
Princeton. Later on I was able to get the plantation on a fairly profitable basis - 3
though you see what it's come to now. 3
3
"My mother died when I was twenty, and my grandfather two years later. It was 3
rather lonely after that; and in '85 I married a distant cousin in New Orleans. 3
Things might have bee different if she'd lived, but she died when my son Denis 3
was born. Then I had only Denis. I didn't try marriage again, but gave all my 3
time to the boy. He was like me - like all the de Russys - darkish and tall and 3
thin, and with the devil of a temper. I gave him the same training my 3
grandfather had give me, but he didn't need much training when it came to 3
points of honor. It was in him, I reckon. Never saw such high spirit - all I could 3
do to keep him from running away to the Spanish War when he was eleven! 3
Romantic young devil, too - full of high notions - you'd call 'em Victorian, now - 3
no trouble at all to make him let the nigger wenches alone. I sent him to the same 3
school I'd gone to, and to Princeton, too. He was Class of 1909. 3
3
"In the end he decided to be a doctor, and went a year to the Harvard Medical 3
School. Then he hit on the idea of keeping to the old French tradition of the 3
family, and argued me into sending him across to the Sorbonne. I did - and 3
proudly enough, though I knew I'd be how lonely I'd be with him so far off. 3
Would to God I hadn't! I thought he was the safest kind of boy to be in Paris. He 3
had a room in the Rue St. Jacques - that's near the University in the 'Latin 3
Quarter' - but according to his letters and his friends he didn't cut up with the 3
gayer dogs at all. The people he knew were mostly young fellows from home - 3
serious students and artists who thought more of their work than of striking 3
attitudes and painting the town red. 3
3
"But of course there were lots of fellows who were on a sort of dividing line 3
between serious studies and the devil. The aesthetes - the decadents, you know. 3
Experiments in life and sensation - the Baudelaire kind of a chap. Naturally 3
Denis ran up against a good many of these, and saw a good deal of their life. 3
They had all sorts of crazy circles and cults - imitation devil-worship, fake Black 3
Masses, and the like. Doubt if it did them much harm on the whole - probably 3
most of 'em forgot all about it in a year or two. One of the deepest in this queer 3
stuff was a fellow Denis had known at school - for that matter, whose father I'd 3
known myself. Frank Marsh, of New Orleans. Disciple of Lafcadio Hearn and 3
Gauguin and Van Gogh - regular epitome of the yellow 'nineties. Poor devil - he 3
had the makings of a great artist, at that. 3
3
"Marsh was the oldest friend Denis had in Paris, so as a matter of course they 3
saw a good deal of each other - to talk over old times at St. Clair academy, and all 3
that. The boy wrote me a good deal about him, and I didn't see any especial 3
harm when he spoke of the group of mystics Marsh ran with. It seems there was 3
3
3
3
991 3
3
3
3
some cult of prehistoric Egyptian and Carthaginian magic having a rage among 3
the Bohemian element on the left bank - some nonsensical thing that pretended 3
to reach back to forgotten sources of hidden truth in lost African civilisations - 3
the great Zimbabwe, the dead Atlantean cities in the Haggar region of the Sahara 3
- and they had a lot of gibberish concerned with snakes and human hair. At least, 3
I called it gibberish, then. Denis used to quote Marsh as saying odd things about 3
the veiled facts behind the legend of Medusa's snaky locks - and behind the later 3
Ptolemaic myth of Berenice, who offered up her hair to save her husband- 3
brother, and had it set in the sky as the constellation Coma Berenices. 3
3
"I don't think this business made much impression on Denis until the night of 3
the queer ritual at Marsh's rooms when he met the priestess. Most of the 3
devotees of the cult were young fellows, but the head of it was a young woman 3
who called herself 'Tanit-Isis' - letting it be known that her real name - her name 3
in this latest incarnation, as she put it - was Marceline Bedard. She claimed to be 3
the left-handed daughter of Marquis de Chameaux, and seemed to have been 3
both a petty artist and an artist's model before adopting this more lucrative 3
magical game. Someone said she had lived for a time in the West Indies - 3
Martinique, I think - but she was very reticent about herself. Part of her pose was 3
a great show of austerity and holiness, but I don't think the more experienced 3
students took that very seriously. 3
3
"Denis, though, was far from experienced, and wrote me fully ten pages of slush 3
about the goddess he had discovered. If I'd only realised his simplicity I might 3
have done something, but I never thought a puppy infatuation like could mean 3
much. I felt absurdly sure that Denis' touchy personal honour and family pride 3
would always keep him out of the most serious complications. 3
3
"As time went, though, his letters began to make me nervous. He mentioned this 3
Marceline more and more, and his friends less and les, and began talking about 3
the 'cruel and silly way' they declined to introduce her to their mothers and 3
sisters. He seems to have asked her no questions about herself, and I don't doubt 3
but that she filled him full of romantic legendry concerning her origin and divine 3
revelations and the way people slighted her. At length I could see that Denis was 3
altogether cutting his own crowd and spending the bulk of his time with his 3
alluring priestess. At her especial request he never told the old crowd of their 3
continual meetings; so nobody over there tried to break the affair up. 3
3
"I suppose she thought he was fabulously rich; for he had the air of a patrician, 3
and people of a certain class think all aristocratic Americans are wealthy. In any 3
case, she probably thought this a rare chance to contract a genuine right-handed 3
alliance with a really eligible young man. By the time my nervousness burst into 3
open advice, it was too late. The boy had lawfully married her, and wrote that he 3
3
3
3
992 3
3
3
3
was dropping his studies and bringing the woman home to Riverside. He said 3
she had made a great sacrifice and resigned her leadership of the magical cult, 3
and that henceforward she would be merely a private gentlewoman - the future 3
mistress of Riverside, and mother of de Russys to come. 3
3
"Well, sir, I took it the best way I could. I knew that sophisticated Continentals 3
have different standards from our old American ones - and anyway, I really 3
knew nothing against the woman. A charlatan, perhaps, but why necessarily any 3
worse? I suppose I tried to keep as naive as possible about such things in those 3
days, for the boy's sake. Clearly, there was nothing for a man of sense to do but 3
let Denis alone so long as his new wife conformed to de Russy ways. Let her 3
have a chance to prove herself - perhaps she wouldn't hurt the family as much as 3
some might fear. So I didn't raise any objections or ask any penitence. The thing 3
was done, and I stood ready to welcome the boy back, whatever he brought with 3
him. 3
3
"They got here three weeks after the telegram telling of marriage. Marceline was 3
beautiful - there was no denying that - and I could see how the boy might very 3
well get foolish about her. She did have an air of breeding, and I think to this day 3
she must have had some strains of good blood in her. She was apparently not 3
much over twenty; of medium size, fairly slim, and as graceful as a tigress in 3
posture and motion. Her complexion was a deep olive - like old ivory - and her 3
eyes were large and very dark. She had small, classically regular features - 3
though not quite clean-cut enough to suit my taste - and the most singular braid 3
of jet black hair that I ever saw. 3
3
"I didn't wonder that she had dragged the subject of hair into her magical cult, 3
for with that heavy profusion of it the idea must have occurred to her naturally. 3
Coiled up, it made her look like some Oriental princess in a drawing of Aubrey 3
Beardsley's. Hanging down her back, it came well below her knees and shone in 3
the light as if it had possessed some separate, unholy vitality of its own. I would 3
almost have thought of Medusa or Berenice myself - without having such things 3
suggested to me - upon seeing and studying that hair. 3
3
"Sometimes I thought it moved slightly of itself, and tended to arrange itself in 3
distinct ropes or strands, but this may have been sheer illusion. She braided it 3
incessantly, and seemed to use some sort of preparation on it. I got the notion 3
once - a curious, whimsical notion - that it was a living being which she had to 3
feed in some strange way. All nonsense - but it added to my feeling of constraint 3
about her and her hair. 3
3
"For I can't deny that I failed to like her wholly, no matter how hard I tried. I 3
couldn't tell what the trouble was, but it was there. Something about her repelled 3
3
3
3
993 3
3
3
3
me very subtly, and I could not help weaving morbid and macabre associations 3
about everything connected with her. Her complexion called up thoughts of 3
Babylon, Atlantis, Lemuria, and the terrible forgotten dominations of an elder 3
world; her eyes struck me sometimes as the eyes of some unholy forest creature 3
or animal goddess too immeasurably ancient to be fully human; and her hair - 3
that dense, exotic, overnourished growth of oily inkiness - made one shiver as a 3
great black python might have done. There was no doubt but that she realised 3
my involuntary attitude - though I tried to hide it, and she tried to hide the fact 3
that she noticed it. 3
3
"Yet the boy's infatuation lasted. He positively fawned on her, and overdid all 3
the little gallantries of daily life to a sickening degree. She appeared to return the 3
feeling, though I could see it took a conscious effort to make her duplicate his 3
enthusiasms and extravagances. For one thing, I think she was piqued to learn 3
we weren't as wealthy as she had expected. 3
3
"It was a bad business all told. I could see that sad undercurrents were arising. 3
Denis was half-hypnotised with puppy-love, and began to grow away from as he 3
felt my shrinking from his wife. This kind of thing went on for months, and I saw 3
that I was losing my only son - the boy who had formed the centre of all my 3
thoughts and acts for the past quarter century. I'll own that I felt bitter about it - 3
what father wouldn't? And yet I could do nothing. 3
3
"Marceline seemed to be a good wife enough in those early months, and our 3
friends received her without any quibbling or questioning. I was always nervous, 3
though, about what some of the young fellows in Paris might write home to their 3
relatives after the news of the marriage spread around. Despite the woman's love 3
of secrecy, it couldn't remain hidden forever - indeed, Denis had written a few of 3
his closest friends, in strict confidence, as soon as he was settled with her at 3
Riverside. 3
3
"I got to staying alone in my room more and more, with my failing health as an 3
excuse. It was bout that time that my present spinal neuritis began to develop - 3
which made the excuse a pretty good one. Denis didn't seem to notice the 3
trouble, or take any interest in me and my habits and affairs; and it hurt me to 3
see how callous he was getting. I began to get sleepless, and often racked my 3
brain in the night to try to find out what made my new daughter-in-law so 3
repulsive and even dimly horrible to me. It surely wasn't her old mystical 3
nonsense, for she had left all the past behind her and never mentioned it once. 3
She didn't even do any painting, although I understood that she had once 3
dabbled in art. 3
3
3
3
994 3
3
3
3
"Oddly, the only ones who seemed to share my uneasiness were the servants. 3
The darkies around the house seemed very sullen in their attitude toward her, 3
and in a few weeks all save the few who were strongly attached to our family 3
had left. These few - old Scipio and his wife Sarah, the cook Delilah, and Mary, 3
Scipio's daughter - were as civil as possible; but plainly revealed that their new 3
mistress commanded their duty rather than their affection. They stayed in their 3
own remote part of the house as much as possible. McCabe, our white chauffeur, 3
was insolently admiring rather than hostile; and another exception was a very 3
old Zulu woman, said to have been a sort of leader in her small cabin as a kind of 3
family pensioner. Old Sophonisba always shewed reverence whenever Marceline 3
came near her, and one time I saw her kiss the ground where her mistress had 3
walked. Blacks are superstitious animals, and I wondered whether Marceline 3
had been talking any of her mystical nonsense to our hands in order to overcome 3
their evident dislike." 3
3
Ill 3
3
"Well, that's how we went on for nearly half a year. Then, in the summer of 1916, 3
things began to happen. Toward the middle of June Denis got a note from his old 3
friend Frank Marsh, telling of a sort of nervous breakdown which made him 3
want to take a rest in the country. It was postmarked New Orleans - for Marsh 3
had gone home from Paris when he felt the collapse coming on - and seemed a 3
very plain though polite bid for an invitation from us. Marsh, of course, knew 3
that Marceline was here; and asked very courteously after her. Denis was sorry 3
to hear of his trouble and told him at once to come along for an indefinite visit. 3
3
"Marsh came - and I was shocked to notice how he had changed since I had seen 3
him in his earlier days. He was a smallish, lightish fellow, with blue eyes and an 3
undecided chin; and now I could see the effects of drink and I don't know what 3
else in his puffy eyelids, enlarged nose-pores, and heavy lines around the mouth. 3
I reckon he had taken his dose of decadence pretty seriously, and set out to be as 3
much of a Rimbaud, Baudelaire, or Lautreamont as he could. And yet he was 3
delightful to talk to - for like all decadents he was exquisitely sensitive to the 3
color and atmosphere and names of things; admirably, thoroughly alive, and 3
with whole records of conscious experience in obscure, shadowy fields of living 3
and feeling which most of us pass over without knowing they exist. Poor young 3
devil - if only his father had lived longer and taken him in hand! There was great 3
stuff in the boy! 3
3
"I was glad of the visit, for I felt it would help to set up a normal atmosphere in 3
the house again. And that's what it really seemed to do at first; for as I said. 3
Marsh was a delight to have around. He was as sincere and profound an artist as 3
I ever saw in my life, and I certainly believe that nothing on earth mattered to 3
3
3
3
995 3
3
3
3
him except the perception and expression of beauty. When he saw an exquisite 3
thing, or was creating one, his eyes would dilate until the light irises were nearly 3
out of sight - leaving two mystical black pits in that weak, delicate, chalk-like 3
face; black pits opening on strange worlds which none of us could guess about. 3
3
"When he reached here, though, he didn't have many chances to shew this 3
tendency; for he had, as he told Denis, gone quite stale. It seems he had been 3
very successful as an artist of a bizarre kind - like Fuseli or Goya or Sime or Clark 3
Ashton Smith - but had suddenly become played out. The world of ordinary 3
things around him had ceased to hold anything he could recognize as beauty - 3
beauty, that is, of enough force and poignancy to arouse his creative faculty. He 3
had often been this way before - all decadents are - but this time he could not 3
invent any new, strange, or outre sensation or experience which would supply 3
the needed illusion of fresh beauty or stimulatingly adventurous expectancy. He 3
was like a Durtal or a des Esseintes at the most jaded point of his curious orbit. 3
3
"Marceline was away when Marsh arrived. She hadn't been enthusiastic about 3
his coming, and had refused to decline an invitation from some of our friends in 3
St. Louis which came about that time for her and Denis. Denis, of course, stayed 3
to receive his guest; but Marceline had gone on alone. It was the first time they 3
had ever been separated, and I hoped the interval would help to dispel the daze 3
that was making such a fool of the boy. Marceline shewed no hurry to get back, 3
but seemed to me to prolong her absence as much as she could. Denis stood it 3
better than one would have expected from such a doting husband, and seemed 3
more like his old self as he talked over other days with Marsh and tried to cheer 3
the listless aesthete up. 3
3
"It was Marsh who seemed most impatient to see the woman; perhaps because 3
he thought her strange beauty, or some phase of the mysticism which had gone 3
into her one-time magical cult, might help to reawaken his interest in things and 3
give him another start toward artistic creation. That there was no baser reason, I 3
was absolutely certain from what I knew of Marsh's character. With all his 3
weaknesses, he was a gentleman - and it had indeed relieved me when I first 3
learned that he wanted to come here because his willingness to accept Denis' 3
hospitality proved that there was no reason why he shouldn't. 3
3
"When, at last, Marceline did return, I could see that Marsh was tremendously 3
affected. He did not attempt to make her talk of the bizarre thing which she had 3
so definitely abandoned, but was unable to hide a powerful admiration which 3
kept his eyes - now dilated in that curious way for the first time during his visit - 3
riveted to her every moment she was in the room. She, however, seemed uneasy 3
rather than pleased by his steady scrutiny - that is, she seemed so at first, though 3
this feeling of hers wore away in a few days, and left the two on a basis of the 3
3
3
3
996 3
3
3
3
most cordial and voluble congeniality. I could see Marsh studying her constantly 3
when he thought no one was watching; and I wondered how long it would be 3
that only the artist, and not the primitive man, would be aroused by her 3
mysterious graces. 3
3
"Denis naturally felt some irritation at this turn of affairs; though he realised that 3
his guest was a man of honour and that, as kindred mystics and aesthetes, 3
Marceline and Marsh would naturally have things and interests to discuss in 3
which a more or less conventional person could have no part. He didn't hold 3
anything against anybody, but merely regretted that his own imagination was 3
too limited and traditional to let him talk with Marceline as Marsh talked. At this 3
stage of things I began to see more of the boy. With his wife otherwise busy, he 3
had time to remember that he had a father - and a father who was ready to help 3
him in any sort of perplexity or difficulty. 3
3
"We often sat together on the veranda watching Marsh and Marceline as they 3
rode up or down the drive on horseback, or played tennis on the court that used 3
to stretch south of the house. They talked mostly in French, which Marsh, though 3
he hadn't more than a quarter-portion of French blood, handled more glibly than 3
either Denis or I could speak it. Marceline's English, always academically correct, 3
was rapidly improving in accent; but it was plain that she relished dropping back 3
into her mother-tongue. As we looked at the congenial couple they made, I could 3
see the boy's cheek and throat muscles tighten - though he wasn't a whit less 3
ideal a host to Marsh, or a whit less considerate husband to Marceline. 3
3
"All this was generally in the afternoon; for Marceline rose very late, had 3
breakfast in bed, and took an immense amount of time preparing to come 3
downstairs. I never knew of anyone so wrapped up in cosmetics, beauty 3
exercises, hair-oils, unguents, and everything of that kind. It was in these 3
morning hours that Denis and Marsh did their real visiting, and exchanged the 3
close confidences which kept their friendship up despite the strain that jealousy 3
imposed. 3
3
"Well, it was in one of those morning talks on the veranda that marsh made the 3
proposition which brought on the end. I was laid up with some of my neuritis, 3
but had managed to get downstairs and stretch out on the front parlour sofa near 3
the long window. Denis and Marsh were just outside; so I couldn't help hearing 3
all they said. They had been talking about art, and the curious, capricious 3
elements needed to jolt an artist into producing the real article, when Marsh 3
suddenly swerved from abstractions to the personal application he must have 3
had in mind from the start. 3
3
3
3
997 3
3
3
3
'"I suppose/ he was saying, 'that nobody can tell just what it is in some scenes or 3
objects that makes them aesthetic stimuli for certain individuals. Basically, of 3
course, it must have some reference to each man's background of stored-up 3
mental associations, for no two people have the same scale of sensitiveness and 3
responses. We decadents are artists for whom all ordinary things have ceased to 3
have any emotional or imaginative significance, but no one of us responds in the 3
same way to exactly the same extraordinary. Now take me, for instance...'" 3
3
"He paused and resumed. 3
3
"'I know, Denny, that I can say these things to you because you such a 3
preternaturally unspoiled mind - clean, fine, direct, objective, and all that. You 3
won't misunderstand as an oversubtilised, effete man of the world might.'" 3
3
"He paused once more. 3
3
"'The fact is, I think I know what's needed to set my imagination working again. 3
I've had a dim idea of it ever since we were in Paris, but I'm sure now. It's 3
Marceline, old chap - that face and that hair, and the train of shadowy images 3
they bring up. Not merely visible beauty - though God knows there's enough of 3
that - but something peculiar and individualised, that can't exactly be explained. 3
Do you know, in the last few days I've felt the existence of such a stimulus so 3
keenly that I honestly think I could outdo myself - break into the real masterpiece 3
class if I could get ahold of paint and canvas at just the time when her face and 3
hair set my fancy stirring and weaving. There's something weird and other- 3
worldly about it - something joined up with the dim ancient thing Marceline 3
represents. I don't know how much she's told you about that side of her, but I 3
can assure you there's plenty of it. She has some marvellous links with the 3
outside...' 3
3
"Some change in Denis' expression must have halted the speaker here, for there 3
was a considerable spell of silence before the words went on. I was utterly taken 3
aback, for I'd expected no such overt development like this; and I wondered 3
what my son could be thinking. My heart began to pound violently, and I 3
strained my ears in the frankest of intentional eavesdropping. Then Marsh 3
resumed. 3
3
"'Of course you're jealous - I know how a speech like mine must sound - but I 3
can swear to you that you needn't be.' 3
3
"Denis did not answer, and Marsh went on. 3
3
3
3
998 3
3
3
3
"' To tell the truth, I could never be in love with Marceline - 1 couldn't even be a 3
cordial friend of hers in the warmest sense. Why, damn it all, I felt like a 3
hypocrite talking with her these days as I've been doing. 3
3
"'The case simply is, that one of her phase of her half hyponotises me in a certain 3
way - a very strange, fantastic, and dimly terrible way - just as another phase half 3
hypnotises you in a much more normal way. I see something in her - or to be 3
psychologically exact, something through her or beyond her - that you didn't see 3
at all. Something that brings up a vast pageantry of shapes from forgotten 3
abysses, and makes me want to paint incredible things whose outlines vanish the 3
instant I try to envisage them clearly. Don't mistake, Denny, your wife is a 3
magnificent being, a splendid focus of cosmic forces who has a right to be called 3
divine if anything on earth has!' 3
3
"I felt a clearing of the situation at this point, for the abstract strangeness of 3
Marsh's statement, plus the flattery he was now heaping on Marceline, could not 3
fail to disarm and mollify one as fondly proud of his consort as Denis always 3
was. Marsh evidently caught the change himself, for there was more confidence 3
in his tone as he continued. 3
3
'"I must paint her, Denny - must paint that hair - and you won't regret. There's 3
something more than mortal about that hair - something more than beautiful - ' 3
3
"He paused, and I wondered what Denis could be thinking. I wondered, indeed, 3
what I was really thinking myself. Was Marsh's interest actually that of the artist 3
alone, or was he merely infatuated as Denis had been? I had thought, in their 3
schooldays, that he had envied my boy; and I dimly felt that it might be the same 3
now. On the other hand, something in that talk of artistic stimulus had rung 3
amazingly true; so that the more I pondered, the more I was inclined to take the 3
stuff at face value. Denis seemed to do so, too, for although I could not catch his 3
low-spoken reply, I could tell by the effect it produced that it must have been 3
affirmative. 3
3
"There was a sound of someone slapping another on the back, and then a 3
grateful speech from Marsh that I was long to remember. 3
3
"'That's great, Denny, and just as I told you, you'll never regret it. In a sense, I'm 3
half doing it for you. You'll be a different man when you see it. I'll put you back 3
where you used to be - give you a waking-up and a sort of salvation - but you 3
can't see what I mean as yet. Just remember old friendship, and don't get the 3
idea that I'm not the same old bird!' 3
3
3
3
999 3
3
3
3
"I rose perplexedly as I saw the two stroll off across the lawn, arm in arm, and 3
smoking in unison. What could Marsh have meant by his strange and almost 3
ominous reassurance? The more my fears were quieted in one direction, the 3
more they were aroused in another. Look at it any way I could, it seemed to be a 3
rather bad business. 3
3
"But matters got started just the same. Denis fixed up an attic room with 3
skylights, and Marsh sent for all sorts of painting equipment. Everyone was 3
rather excited about the new venture, and I was at least glad that something was 3
on foot to break the brooding tension. Soon the sittings began, and we all took 3
them quite seriously - for we could see that Marsh regarded them as important 3
artistic events. Denny and I used to go quietly about the house as though 3
something sacred were occurring, and we knew that it was sacred as far as marsh 3
was concerned. 3
3
"With Marceline, though, it was a different matter, as I began to see at once. 3
Whatever Marsh's reactions to the sittings may have been, hers were painfully 3
obvious. Every possible way she betrayed a frank and commonplace infatuation 3
for the artist, and would repulse Denis' marks of affection whenever she dared. 3
Oddly, I noticed this more vividly than Denis himself, and tried to devise some 3
plan for keeping the boy's mind easy until the matter could be straightened out. 3
There was no use in having him excited about it if it could be helped. 3
3
"In the end I decided that Denis had better be away while the disagreeable 3
situation existed. I could represent his interests well enough at this end, and 3
sooner or later Marsh would finish the picture and go. My view of Marsh's 3
honour was such that I did not look for any worse developments. When the 3
matter had blown over, and Marceline had forgotten about her new infatuation, 3
it would be time enough to have Denis on hand again. 3
3
"So I wrote a long letter to my marketing and financial agent in New York, and 3
cooked up a plan to have the boy summoned there for an indefinite time. I had 3
the agent write him that our affairs absolutely required one of us to go East, and 3
of course my illness made it clear that I could not be the one. It was arranged that 3
when Denis got to New York he would find enough plausible matters to keep 3
him busy as long as I thought he ought to be away. 3
3
"The plan worked perfectly, and Denis started for New York without the least 3
suspicion; Marceline and Marsh going with him in the car to Cape Girardeau, 3
where he caught the afternoon train to St. Louis. They returned after dark, and as 3
McCabe drove the car back to the stables I could hear them talking on the 3
veranda - in those same chairs near the long parlour window where Marsh and 3
Denis had sat when I overheard them talk about the portrait. This time I resolved 3
3
3
3
1000 3
3
3
3
to do some intentional eavesdropping, so quietly went down to the front parlour 3
and stretched out on the sofa near the window. 3
3
"At first I could not hear anything but very shortly there came the sound of a 3
chair being shifted, followed by a short, sharp breath and a sort of inarticulately 3
hurt exclamation from Marceline. Then I heard Marsh speaking in a strained, 3
almost formal voice. 3
3
"'I'd enjoy working tonight if you aren't too tired.' 3
3
"Marceline's reply was in the same hurt tone which had marked her exclamation. 3
She used English as he had done. 3
3
"'Oh, Frank, is that really all you care about? Forever working! Can't we just sit 3
out here in this glorious moonlight?' 3
3
"He answered impatiently, his voice shewing a certain contempt beneath the 3
dominant quality of artistic enthusiasm. 3
3
"'Moonlight! Good God, what cheap sentimentality! For a supposedly 3
sophisticated person you surely do hang on to some of the crudest claptrap that 3
ever escaped from the dime novels! With art at your elbow, you have to think of 3
the moon - cheap as a spotlight at the varieties! Or perhaps it makes you think of 3
the Roodmas dance around the stone pillars at Auteiul. Hell, how you used to 3
make those goggle-eyed yaps stare! But not - I suppose you've dropped all that 3
now. No more Atlantean magic or hair-snake rites for Madame de Russy! I'm the 3
only one to remember the old things - the things that came down through the 3
temples of Tanit and echoed on the ramparts of Zimbabwe. But I won't be 3
cheated of that remembrance - all that is weaving itself into the thing on my 3
canvas - the thing that is going to capture wonder and crystallise the secrets of 3
75,000 years...' 3
3
"Marceline interrupted in a voice full of mixed emotions. 3
3
"'It's you who are cheaply sentimental now! You know well that the old things 3
had better be let alone. All of you had better watch out if ever I chant the old rites 3
or try to call up what lies hidden in Yuggoth, Zimbabwe, and R'lyeh. I thought 3
you had more sense!' 3
3
"'You lack logic. You want me to be interested in this precious painting of yours, 3
yet you never let me see what you're doing. Always that black cloth over it! It's 3
of me - I shouldn't think it would matter if I saw it. . .' 3
3
"Marsh was interrupting this time, his voice curiously hard and strained. 3
3
1001 3
3
3
3
"'No. Not now. You'll see it in due course of time. You say it's of you - yes, it's 3
that, but it's more. If you knew, you mightn't be so impatient. Poor Denis! My 3
God, it's a shame!' 3
3
'"My throat was suddenly dry as the words rose to an almost febrile pitch. What 3
could Marsh mean? Suddenly I saw that he had stopped and was entering the 3
house alone. I heard the front door slam, and listened as his footsteps ascended 3
the stairs. Outside on the veranda I could still hear Marceline's heavy, angry 3
breathing. I crept away sick at heart, feeling that there were grave things to ferret 3
out before I could safely let Denis come back. 3
3
"After that evening the tension around the place was even worse than before. 3
Marceline had always lived on flattery and fawning and the shock of those few 3
blunt words from Marsh was too much for her temperament. There was no 3
living in the house with her anymore, for with poor Denis gone she took out her 3
abusiveness on everybody. When she could find no one indoors to quarrel with 3
she would go out to Sophonisba's cabin and spend hours talking with the queer 3
old Zulu woman. Aunt Sophy was the only person who would fawn abjectly 3
enough to suit her, and when I tried once to overhear their conversation I found 3
Marceline whispering about 'elder secrets' and 'unknown Kadath' while the 3
negress rocked to and fro in her chair, making inarticulate sounds of reverence 3
and admiration every now and then. 3
3
"But nothing could break her dog-like infatuation for Marsh. She would talk 3
bitterly and sullenly to him, yet was getting more and more obedient to his 3
wishes. It was very convenient for him, since he now became able to make her 3
pose for the picture whenever he felt like painting. He tried to shew gratitude for 3
this willingness, but I thought I could detect a kind of contempt or even loathing 3
beneath his careful politeness. For my part, I frankly hated Marceline! There was 3
no use in calling my attitude anything as mild as dislike these days. Certainly, I 3
was glad Denis was away. His letters, not nearly so frequent as I wished, shewed 3
signs of strain and worry. 3
3
"As the middle of August went by I gathered from Marsh's remarks that the 3
portrait was nearly done. His mood seemed increasingly sardonic, though 3
Marceline's temper improved a bit as the prospect of seeing the thing tickled her 3
vanity. I can still recall the day when Marsh said he'd have everything finished 3
within a week. Marceline brightened up perceptibly, though not without a 3
venomous look at me. It seemed as if her coiled hair visibly tightened around her 3
head. 3
3
"'I'm to be the first to see it!' she snapped. Then, smiling at Marsh, she said, 'And 3
if I don't like it I shall slash it to pieces!' 3
3
3
3
1002 3
3
3
3
"Marsh's face took on the most curious look I have ever seen it wear as he 3
answered her. 3
3
'"I can't vouch for your taste, Marcehne, but I swear it will be magnificent! Not 3
that I want to take much credit - art creates itself - and this thing had to be done. 3
Just wait!' 3
3
"During the next few days I felt a queer sense of foreboding, as if the completion 3
of the picture meant a kind of catastrophe instead of a relief. Denis, too, had not 3
written me, and my agent in New York said he was planning some trip to the 3
country. I wondered what the outcome of the whole thing would be. What a 3
queer mixture of elements - Marsh and Marceline, Denis and I! How would all 3
these ultimately react on one another? When my fears grew too great I tried to 3
lay them all to my infirmity, but that explanation never quite satisfied me." 3
3
IV 3
3
"Well, the thing exploded on Tuesday, the twenty-sixth of August. I had risen at 3
my usual time and had breakfast, but was not good for much because of the pain 3
in my spine. It had been troubling me badly of late, and forcing me to take 3
opiates when it got too unbearable; nobody else was downstairs except the 3
servants, though I could hear Marceline moving about in her room. Marsh slept 3
in the attic next his studio, and had begun to keep such late hours that he was 3
seldom up till noon. About ten o'clock the pain got the better of me, so that I took 3
a double dose of my opiate and lay down on the parlour sofa. The last I heard 3
was Marceline's pacing overhead. Poor creature - if I had known! She must have 3
been walking before the long mirror admiring herself. That was like her. Vain 3
from start to finish - revelling in her own beauty, just as she revelled in all the 3
little luxuries Denis was able to give her. 3
3
"I didn't wake up till near sunset, and knew instantly how long I had slept from 3
the golden light and long shadows outside the long window. Nobody was about, 3
and a sort of unnatural stillness seemed to be hovering over everything. From 3
afar, though, I thought I could sense a faint howling, wild and intermittent, 3
whose quality had a slight but baffling familiarity about it. I'm not much for 3
psychic premonitions, but I was frightfully uneasy from the start. There had been 3
dreams - even worse than the ones I had been dreaming in the weeks before - 3
and this time they seemed hideously linked to some black and festering reality. 3
The whole place had a poisonous air. Afterward I reflected that certain sounds 3
must have filtered through into my unconscious brain during those hours of 3
drugged sleep. My pain, though, was very much eased; and I rose and walked 3
without difficulty. 3
3
3
3
1003 3
3
3
3
"Soon enough I began to see that something was wrong. Marsh and Marcehne 3
might have been riding, but someone ought to have been getting dinner in the 3
kitchen. Instead, there was only silence, except for that faint, distant howl or 3
wail; and nobody answered when I pulled the old-fashioned bell-cord to 3
summon Scipio. Then, chancing to look up, I saw the spreading stain on the 3
ceiling - the bright re stain, that must have come through the floor of Marceline's 3
room. 3
3
"In an instant I forgot my crippled back and hurried upstairs to find out the 3
worst. Everything under the sun raced through my mind as I struggled with the 3
dampness-warped door of that silent chamber, and most hideous of all was a 3
terrible sense of malign fulfilment and fatal expectedness. I had, it struck me, 3
known all along that nameless horrors were gathering; that something 3
profoundly and cosmically evil had gained a foot-hold under my roof from 3
which only blood and tragedy could result. 3
3
"The door gave at last, and I stumbled into the large room beyond - all dim from 3
the branches of the great trees outside the windows. For a moment I could do 3
nothing but flinch at the faint evil odour that immediately struck my nostrils. 3
Then, turning on the electric light and glancing around, I glimpsed a nameless 3
blasphemy on the yellow and blue rug. 3
3
"It lay face down in a great pool of dark, thickened blood, and had the gory print 3
of a shod human foot in the middle of its naked back. Blood was spattered 3
everywhere - on the walls, furniture, and floor. My knees gave way as I took in 3
the sight, so that I had to stumble to a chair and slump down. The thing had 3
obviously been a human being, though its identity was not easy to establish at 3
first; since it was without clothes, and had most of its hair hacked and torn from 3
the scalp in a very crude way. It was of a deep ivory colour, and I knew that it 3
must have been Marceline. The shoe-print on the back made the thing seem all 3
the more hellish. I could not even picture the strange, loathsome tragedy which 3
must have taken place while I slept in the room below. When I raised my hand to 3
wipe my dripping forehead I saw that my fingers were sticky with blood. I 3
shuddered, then realised that it must have come from the knob of the door which 3
the unknown murderer had forced shut behind him as he left. He had taken his 3
weapon with him, it seemed, for no instrument of death was visible here. 3
3
"As I studied the floor I saw that a line of sticky footprints like the one on the 3
body led away from the horror to the door. There was another blood-trail, too, 3
and of a less easily explainable kind; a broadish, continuous line, as if marking 3
the path of some huge snake. At first I concluded it must be due to something the 3
murderer had dragged after him. Then, noting the way some of the footprints 3
seemed to be superimposed on it, I was forced to believe that it could have been 3
3
3
3
1004 3
3
3
3
there when the murderer left. But what crawHng entity could have been in that 3
room with the victim and her assassin, leaving before the killer when the deed 3
was done? As I asked myself this question I thought I heard fresh bursts of that 3
faint, distant wailing. 3
3
"Finally, rousing myself from a lethargy of horror, I got on my feet again and 3
began following the footprints. Who the murderer was, I could not even faintly 3
guess, nor could I try to explain the absence of the servants. I vaguely felt that I 3
ought to go up to Marsh's attic quarters, but before I had fully formulated the 3
idea I saw that the bloody trail was indeed taking me there. Was he himself the 3
murderer? Had he gone mad under the strain of the morbid situation and 3
suddenly run amok? 3
3
"In the attic corridor the trail became faint, the prints almost ceasing as they 3
merged with the dark carpet. I could still, however, discern the strange single 3
path of the entity who had gone first; and this led straight to the closed door of 3
Marsh's studio, disappearing beneath it at a point about half way from side to 3
side. Evidently it had crossed the threshold at a time when the door was wide 3
open. 3
3
"Sick at heart, I tried the knob and found the door unlocked. Opening it, I 3
paused in the waning north light to see what fresh nightmare might be awaiting 3
me. There was certainly something human on the floor, and I reached for the 3
switch to turn on the chandelier. 3
3
"But as the light flashed up my gaze left the floor and its horror - that was Marsh, 3
poor devil - to fix itself frantically and incredulously upon the living thing that 3
cowered and stared in the open doorway leading to Marsh's bedroom. It was a 3
tousled, wild-eyed thing, crusted with dried blood and carrying in its hand a 3
wicked machete which had been one of the ornaments of the studio wall. Yet 3
even in that awful moment I recognised it as one whom I had thought more than 3
a thousand miles away. It was my own boy Denis - or the maddened wreck 3
which had once been Denis. 3
3
"The sight of me seemed to bring back a trifle of sanity - or at least of memory - 3
in the poor boy. He straightened up and began to toss his head about as if trying 3
to shake free from some enveloping influence. I could not speak a word, but 3
moved my lips in an effort to get back my voice. My eyes wandered for a 3
moment to the figure on the floor in front of the heavily draped easel - the figure 3
toward which the strange blood-trail led, and which seemed to be tangled in the 3
coils of some dark, ropy object. The shifting of my glance apparently produced 3
some impression in the twisted brain of the boy, for suddenly he began to mutter 3
in a hoarse whisper whose purport I was soon able to catch. 3
3
3
3
1005 3
3
3
3
'"I had to exterminate her - she was the devil - the summit and high-priestess of 3
all evil - the spawn of the pit - Marsh knew, and tried to warn me. Good old 3
Frank - I didn't kill him, though I was ready to before I realised. But I went down 3
there and killed her - then that cursed hair - ' 3
3
"I listened in horror as Denis choked, paused, and began again. 3
3
"'You didn't know - her letters got queer and I knew she was in love with Marsh. 3
Then she nearly stopped writing. He never mentioned her - I felt something was 3
wrong, and thought I ought to come back and find out. Couldn't tell you - your 3
manner would have given it away. Wanted to surprise them. Got here about 3
noon today - came in a cab and sent the house-servants all off - let the field hands 3
alone, for their cabins are all out of earshot. Told McCabe to get me some things 3
in Cape Girardeau and not bother to come back until tomorrow. Had all the 3
niggers take the old car and let Mary drive them to Bend Village for a vacation - 3
told 'em we were all going on some sort of outing and wouldn't need help. Said 3
they'd better stay all night with Uncle Scip's cousin, who keeps that nigger 3
boarding house.' 3
3
"Denis was getting very incoherent now, and I strained my ears to grasp every 3
word. Again I thought I heard that wild, far-off wail, but the story had first place 3
for the present. 3
3
"'Saw you sleeping in the parlour, and took a chance you wouldn't wake up. 3
Then went upstairs on the quiet to hunt up Marsh and. . .that woman!' 3
3
"The boy shuddered as he avoided pronouncing Marceline's name. At the same 3
time I saw his eyes dilate in unison with a bursting of the distant crying, whose 3
vague familiarity had now become very great. 3
3
"'She was not in her room, so I went up to the studio. Door was shut, and I could 3
hear voices inside. Didn't knock - just burst in and found her posing for the 3
picture. Nude, but with the hellish hair all draped around her. And making all 3
sorts of sheep's eyes at Marsh. He had the easel turned half away from the door, 3
so I couldn't see the picture. Both of them were pretty well jolted when I shewed 3
up, and Marsh dropped his brush. I was in a rage and told him he'd have to 3
shew me the portrait, but he got calmer every minute. Told me it wasn't quite 3
done, but would be in a day or two - said I could see it then - she - hadn't seen it. 3
3
"'But that didn't go with me. I stepped up, and he dropped a velvet curtain over 3
the thing before I could see it. He was ready to fight before letting me see it, but 3
that - that - she - stepped up and sided with me. Said we ought to see it. Frank 3
got horrible worked up, and gave me a punch when I tried to get at the punch 3
3
3
3
1006 3
3
3
3
when I tried to get at the curtain. I punched back and seemed to have knocked 3
him out. Then I was almost knocked out myself by the shriek that - that creature - 3
gave. She'd drawn aside the hangings herself, and caught a look at what Marsh 3
had been painting. I wheeled around and saw her rushing like mad out of the 3
room - then I saw the picture.' 3
3
"Madness flared up in the boy's eyes again as he got to this place, and I thought 3
for a minute he was going to spring at me with his machete. But after a pause he 3
partly steadied himself. 3
3
"'Oh, God - that thing! Don't ever look at it! Burn it with the hangings around it 3
and throw the ashes into the river! Marsh knew - and was warning me. He knew 3
what it was - what that woman - that leopardess, or gorgon, or lamia, or 3
whatever she was - actually represented. He'd tried to hint to me ever since I met 3
her in his Paris studio, but it couldn't be told in words. I thought they all 3
wronged her when they whispered horrors about her - she had me hypnotised so 3
that I couldn't believe the plain facts - but this picture has caught the whole 3
secret - the whole monstrous background! 3
3
"'God, but Frank is an artist! That thing is the greatest piece any living soul has 3
produced since Rembrandt! It's a crime to burn it - but it would be a greater 3
crime to let it exist - just as it would have been an abhorrent sin to let - that she- 3
daemon - exist any longer. The minute I saw it I understood what - she - was, 3
and what part she played in the frightful secret that has come down from the 3
days of Cthulhu and the Elder Ones - the secret that was nearly wiped out when 3
Atlantis sank, but that kept half alive in hidden traditions and allegorical myths 3
and furtive, midnight cult-practices. For you know she was the real thing. It 3
wasn't any fake. It would have been merciful if it had been a fake. It was the old, 3
hideous shadow that philosophers never dared mention - the thing hinted at in 3
the Necronomicon and symbolised in the Easter Island colossi. 3
3
"'She thought we couldn't see through - that the false front would hold till we 3
had bartered away our immortal souls. And she was half right - she'd have got 3
me in the end. She was only - waiting. But Frank - good old Frank - was too 3
much for me. He knew what it all meant, and painted it. I don't wonder she 3
shrieked and ran off when she saw it. It wasn't quite done, but God knows 3
enough was there. 3
3
"'Then I knew I'd got to kill her - kill her, and everything connected with her. It 3
was a taint that wholesome human blood couldn't bear. There was something 3
else, too - but you'll never know that if you burn the picture without looking. I 3
staggered down to her room with this machete that I got off the wall here. 3
3
3
3
1007 3
3
3
3
leaving Frank still knocked out. He was breathing, though, and I knew and 3
thanked heaven I hadn't killed him. 3
3
'"I found her in front of the mirror braiding that accursed hair. She turned on me 3
like a wild beast, and began spitting out her hatred of Marsh. The fact that she'd 3
been in love with him - and I knew she had - only made it worse. For a minute I 3
couldn't move, and she came within an ace of completely hypnotising me. Then I 3
thought of the picture, and the spell broke. She saw the breaking in my eyes, and 3
must have noticed the machete, too. I never saw anything give such a wild jungle 3
beast look as she did then. She sprang for me with claws out like a leopard's, but 3
I was too quick. I swung the machete, and it was all over.' 3
3
"Denis had to stop again, and I saw the perspiration running down his forehead 3
through the spattered blood. But in a moment he hoarsely resumed. 3
3
'"I said it was all over - but God! some of it had only just begun! I felt I had 3
fought the legions of Satan, and put my foot on the back of the thing I had 3
annihilated. Then I saw that blasphemous braid of coarse black hair begin to 3
twist and squirm of itself. 3
3
'"I might have known it. It was all in the old tales. That damnable hair had a life 3
of its own, that couldn't be ended by killing the creature itself. I knew I'd have to 3
burn it, so I started to hack it off with the machete. God, but it was devilish work! 3
Tough - like iron wires - but I managed to do it. And it was loathsome the way 3
the big braid writhed and struggled in my grasp. 3
3
"'About the time I had the last strand cut or pulled off I heard that eldritch 3
wailing from behind the house. You know - it's still going off and on. I don't 3
know what it is, but it must be something springing from this hellish business. It 3
half seems like something I ought to know but can't quite place. It got my nerves 3
the first time I heard it, and I dropped the severed braid in my fright. Then, I got 3
a worse fright - for in another second the braid had turned on me and began to 3
strike venomously with one of its ends which had knotted itself up like a sort of 3
grotesque head. I struck out with the machete, and it turned away. Then, when I 3
had my breath again, I saw that the monstrous thing was crawling along the 3
floor by itself like a great black snake. I couldn't do anything for a while, but 3
when it vanished through the door I managed to pull myself together and 3
stumble after it. I could follow the broad, bloody trail, and I saw it led upstairs. It 3
brought me here - and may heaven curse me if I didn't see it through the 3
doorway, striking at poor dazed Marsh like a maddened rattler as it had struck 3
at me, finally coiling around him as a python would. He had begun to come to, 3
but that abominable serpent got him before he was on his feet. I knew that all of 3
the woman's hatred was behind it, but I hadn't the power to pull it off. I tried. 3
3
3
3
1008 3
3
3
3
but it was too much for me. Even the machete was no good - I couldn't swing it 3
freely or it would have slashed Frank to pieces. So I saw those monstrous coils 3
tighten - saw poor Frank crushed to death before my eyes - and all the time that 3
awful faint howling came from somewhere beyond the fields. 3
3
"'That's all. I pulled the velvet cloth over the picture and hope it'll never be 3
lifted. The thing must be burnt. I couldn't pry the coils off poor, dead Frank - 3
they cling to him like a leach, and seem to have lost their motion altogether. It's 3
as if that snaky rope of hair has a kind of perverse fondness for the man it killed - 3
it's clinging to him - embracing him. You'll have to burn poor Frank with it - but 3
for God's sake don't forget to see it in ashes. That and the picture. They must 3
both go. The safety of the world demands that they go. 3
3
"Denis might have whispered more, but a fresh burst of distant wailing cut us 3
short. For the first time we knew what it was, for a westerly veering wind 3
brought articulate words at last. We ought to have known long before, since 3
sounds much like it had often come from the same source. It was wrinkled 3
Sophonisba, the ancient Zulu witch-woman who had fawned on Marceline, 3
keening from her cabin in a way which crowned the horrors of this nightmare 3
tragedy. We could both hear some of the things she howled, and knew that secret 3
and primordial bonds linked this savage sorceress with that other inheritor of 3
elder secrets who had just been extirpated. Some of the words she used betrayed 3
her closeness to daemonic and palaeogean traditions. 3
3
"'la! la! Shub-Niggurath! Ya-R'lyeh! N'gagi n'bulu bwana n'lolo! Ya, yo, poor 3
Missy Tanit, poor Missy Isis! Marse Clooloo, come up outen de water an' git yo 3
chile - she done daid! She done daid! De hair ain' got no missus no mo', Marse 3
Clooloo. or Sophy, she know! OF Sophy, she done got de black stone outen Big 3
Zimbabwe in ol' Affriky! Ol' Sophy, she done dance in de moonshine roun' de 3
crocodile-stone befo' de N'bangus cotch her and sell her to de ship folks! No mo' 3
Tanit! No mo' Isis! No mo' witch-woman to keep de fire a-goin' in de big stone 3
place! Ya, yo! N'gagi n'bulu bwana n'lolo! la! Shub-Niggurath! She daid! OF 3
Sophy know!' 3
3
"That wasn't the end of the wailing, but it was all I could pay attention to. The 3
expression on my boy's face shewed that it had reminded him of something 3
frightful, and the tightening of his hand on the machete boded no good. I knew 3
he was desperate, and sprang to disarm him before he could do anything more. 3
3
"But I was too late. An old man with a bad spine doesn't count for much 3
physically. There was a terrible struggle, but he had done for himself before 3
many seconds were over. I'm not sure yet but that he tried to kill me, too. His last 3
3
3
3

3
3
3
panting words were something about the need of wiping out everything that had 3
been connected with Marcehne, either by blood or marriage." 3
3
V 3
3
"I wonder to this day that I didn't go stark mad in that instant - or in the 3
moments and hours afterward. In front of me was the slain body of my boy - the 3
only human being I had to cherish - and ten feet away, in front of that shrouded 3
easel, was the body of his best friend, with a nameless coil of horror wound 3
around it. Below was the scalped corpse of that she-monster, about whom I was 3
half-ready to believe anything. I was too dazed to analyse the probability of the 3
hair story - and even if I had not been, that dismal howling coming from Aunt 3
Sophy's cabin would have been enough to quiet doubt for the nonce. 3
3
"If I'd been wise, I'd have done just what poor Denis told me to - burned the 3
picture and the body-grasping hair at once and without curiosity - but I was too 3
shaken to be wise. I suppose I muttered foolish things over my boy - and then I 3
remembered that the night was wearing on and that the servants would be back 3
in the morning. It was plain that a matter like this could never be explained, and 3
I knew that I must cover things up and invent a story. 3
3
"That coil of hair around Marsh was a monstrous thing. As I poked at it with a 3
sword which I took from the wall I almost thought I felt it tighten its grip on the 3
dead man. I didn't dare touch it - and the longer I looked at it the more horrible 3
things I noticed about it. One thing gave me a start. I won't mention it - but it 3
partly explained the need for feeding the hair with queer oils as Marceline had 3
always done. 3
3
"In the end I decided to bury all three bodies in the cellar - with quicklime, which 3
I knew we had in the storehouse. It was a night of hellish work. I dug three 3
graves - my boy's a long way from the other two, for I didn't want him to be near 3
either the woman's body or her hair. I was sorry I couldn't get the coil from 3
around poor marsh. It was terrible work getting them all down to the cellar. I 3
used blankets in carting the woman and the poor devil with the coil around him. 3
Then I had to get two barrels of lime from the storehouse. God must have given 3
me strength, for I not only moved them but filled all three graves without a hitch. 3
3
"Some of the lime I made into whitewash. I had to take a stepladder and fix over 3
the parlour ceiling where the blood had oozed through. And I burned nearly 3
everything in Marceline's room, scrubbing the walls and floor and heavy 3
furniture. I washed up the attic studio, too, and the trail and footprints that led 3
there. And all the time I could hear old Sophy's wailing in the distance. The devil 3
must have been in that creature to let her voice go on like that. But she always 3
3
3
3
1010 3
3
3
3
was howling queer things. That's why the field niggers didn't get scared or 3
curious that night. I locked the studio door and took the key to my room. Then I 3
burned all my stained clothes in the fireplace. By dawn the whole house looked 3
quite normal so far as any casual eye could tell. I hadn't dared touch the covered 3
easel, but meant to attend to that later. 3
3
"Well, the servants came back the next day, and I told them all the young folks 3
had gone to St. Louis. None of the field hands seemed to have seen or heard 3
anything, and old Sophonisba's wailing had stopped at the instant of sunrise. 3
She was like a sphinx after that, and never let out a word of what had been on 3
her brooding brain the day and night before. 3
3
"Later on I pretended that Denis and Marsh and Marceline had gone back to 3
Paris and had a certain discreet agency mail me letters from there - letters I had 3
fixed up in forged handwriting. It took a good deal of deceit and reticence in 3
several things to various friends, and I knew people have secretly suspected me 3
of holding something back. I had the deaths of Marsh and Denis reported during 3
the war, and later said Marceline had entered a convent. Fortunately Marsh was 3
an orphan whose eccentric ways had alienated him from his people in Louisiana. 3
Things might have been patched up a good deal better for me if I had had the 3
sense to burn the picture, sell the plantation, and give up trying to manage things 3
with a shaken and overstrained mind. You see what my folly has brought me to. 3
Failing crops - hands discharged one by one - place falling apart to ruin - and 3
myself a hermit and a target for dozens of queer countryside stories. Nobody will 3
come around here after dark anymore - or any other time if it can be helped. 3
That's why I knew you must be a stranger. 3
3
"And why do I stay here? I can't wholly tell you that. It's bound up too closely 3
with things at the very rim of sane reality. It wouldn't have been so, perhaps, if I 3
hadn't looked at the picture. I ought to have done as poor Denis told me. I 3
honestly meant to burn it when I went up to that locked studio a week after the 3
horror, but I looked first - and that changed everything. 3
3
"No - there's no use telling what I saw. You can, in a way, see for yourself 3
presently; though time and dampness have done their work. I don't think it can 3
hurt you if you want to take a look, but it was different with me. I knew too 3
much of what it all meant. 3
3
"Denis had been right - it was the greatest triumph of human art since 3
Rembrandt, even though still unfinished. I grasped that at the start, and knew 3
that poor Marsh had justified his decadent philosophy. He was to painting what 3
Baudelaire was to poetry - and Marceline was the key that had unlocked his 3
inmost stronghold of genius. 3
3
3
3
1011 3
3
3
3
"The thing almost stunned me when I pulled aside the hangings - stunned me 3
before I half knew what the whole thing was. You know, it's only partly a 3
portrait. Marsh had been pretty literal when he hinted that he wasn't painting 3
Marceline alone, but what he saw through her and beyond her. 3
3
"Of course she was in it - was the key to it, in a sense - but her figure only formed 3
one point in a vast composition. She was nude except for that hideous web of 3
hair spun around her, and was half-seated, half- reclining on a sort of bench or 3
divan, carved in patterns unlike those of any known decorative tradition. There 3
was a monstrously shaped goblet in one hand, from which was spilling fluid 3
whose colour I haven't been able to place or classify to this day - I don't know 3
where Marsh even got the pigments. 3
3
"The figure and the divan were in the left-hand foreground of the strangest sort 3
of scene I ever saw in my life. I think there was a faint suggestion of its all being a 3
kind of emanation from the woman's brain, yet there was also a directly opposite 3
suggestion - as if she were just an evil image or hallucination conjured up by the 3
scene itself. 3
3
"I can't tell you know whether it's an exterior or an interior - whether those 3
hellish Cyclopean vaultings are seen from the outside or the inside, or whether 3
they are indeed carven stone and not merely a morbid fungous arborescence. The 3
geometry of the whole thing is crazy - one gets the acute and obtuse angles all 3
mixed up. 3
3
"And God! The shapes of nightmare that float around in that perpetual daemon 3
twilight! The blasphemies that lurk and leer and hold a Witches' Sabbat with that 3
woman as a high-priestess! The black shaggy entities that are not quite goats - 3
the crocodile-headed beast with three legs and a dorsal row of tentacles - and the 3
flat-nosed aegipans dancing in a pattern that Egypt's priests knew and called 3
accursed! 3
3
"But the scene wasn't Egypt - it was behind Egypt; behind even Atlantis; behind 3
fabled Mu, and myth- whispered Lemuria. It was the ultimate fountainhead of 3
all horror on this earth, and the symbolism shewed only too clearly how integral 3
a part of it Marceline was. I think it must be the unmentionable R'lyeh, that was 3
not built by any creatures of this planet - the thing Marsh and Denis used to talk 3
about in the shadows with hushed voices. In the picture it appears that the whole 3
scene is deep under water - though everybody seems to be breathing freely. 3
3
"Well - I couldn't do anything but look and shudder, and finally I saw that 3
Marceline was watching me craftily out of those monstrous, dilated eyes on the 3
canvas. It was no mere superstition - Marsh had actually caught something of her 3
3
3
3
1012 3
3
3
3
horrible vitality in his symphonies of line and color, so that she still brooded and 3
hated, just as if most of her weren't down in the cellar under quicklime. And it 3
was worst of al when some of those Hecate-born snaky strands of hair began to 3
lift themselves up from the surface and grope out into the room toward me. 3
3
"Then it was that I knew the last final horror, and realised I was a guardian and a 3
prisoner forever, she was the thing from which the first dim legends of Medusa 3
and the Gorgons had sprung, and something in my shaken will had been 3
captured and turned to stone at last. Never again would I be safe from those 3
coiling snaky strands - the strands in the picture, and those that lay brooding 3
under the lime near the wine casks. All too late I recalled the tales of the virtual 3
indestructibility, even through centuries of burial, of the hair of the dead. 3
3
"My life since has been nothing but horror and slavery. Always there had lurked 3
the fear of what broods down in the cellar. In less than a month the niggers 3
began whispering about the great black snake that crawled around near the wine 3
casks after dark, and about the curious way its trail would lead to another spot 3
six feet away. Finally I had to move everything to another part of the cellar, for 3
not a darky could be induced to go near the place where the snake was seen. 3
3
"Then the field hands began talking about the black snake that visited old 3
Sophonisba's cabin every night after midnight. One of them shewed me its trail - 3
and not long afterward I found out that Aunt Sophy herself had begun to pay 3
strange visits to the cellar of the big house, lingering and muttering for hours in 3
the very spot where none of the other blacks would go near. God, but I was glad 3
when that old witch died! I honestly believe she had been a priestess of some 3
ancient and terrible tradition back in Africa. She must have lived to be almost a 3
hundred and fifty years old. 3
3
"Sometimes I think I hear something gliding around the house at night. There 3
will be a queer noise on the stairs, where the boards are loose, and the latch of 3
my room will rattle as if with an inward pressure. I always keep my door locked, 3
of course. Then there are certain mornings when I seem to catch a sickish musty 3
odour in the corridors, and notice a faint, ropy trail through the dust of the 3
floors. I know I must guard the hair in the picture, for if anything were to happen 3
to it, there are entities in this house which would take a sure and terrible 3
revenge. I don't even dare to die - for life and death are all one to those in the 3
clutch of what came out of R'lyeh. Something would be on hand to punish my 3
neglect. Medusa's coil has got me, and it will always be the same. Never mix up 3
with secret and ultimate horror, young man, if you value your immortal soul." 3

3
As the old man finished his story I saw that the small lamp had long since 3
burned dry, and that the large one was nearly empty. It must, I knew, be near 3
dawn, and my ears told me that the storm was over. The tale had held me in a 3
half-daze, and I almost feared to glance at the door lest it reveal an inward 3
pressure from some unnamable source. It would be hard to say which had the 3
greatest hold on me - stark horror, incredulity, or a kind of morbid fantastic 3
curiosity. I was wholly beyond speech and had to wait for my strange host to 3
break the spell. 3
3
"Do you want to see - the thing?" 3
3
His voice was low and hesitant, and I saw he was tremendously in earnest. Of 3
my various emotions, curiosity gained the upper hand; and I nodded silently. He 3
rose, lighting a candle on a nearby table and holding it high before him as he 3
opened the door. 3
3
"Come with me - upstairs." 3
3
I dreaded to brave those musty corridors again, but fascination downed all my 3
qualms. The boards creaked beneath our feet, and I trembled once when I 3
thought I saw a faint, rope-like line trace in the dust near the staircase. 3
3
The steps of the attic were noisy and rickety, with several of the treads missing. I 3
was just glad of the need of looking sharply to my footing, for it gave me an 3
excuse not to glance about. The attic corridor was pitch-black and heavily 3
cobwebbed, and inch-deep with dust except where a beaten trail led to a door on 3
the left at the farther end. As I noticed the rotting remains of a thick carpet I 3
thought of the other feet which had pressed it in bygone decades - of these, and 3
of one thing which did not have feet. 3
3
The old man took me straight to the door at the end of the beaten path, and 3
fumbled a second with the rusty latch. I was acutely frightened know that I knew 3
the picture was so close, yet dared not retreat at this stage. In another moment 3
my host was ushering me into the deserted studio. 3
3
The candle light was very faint, yet served to shew most of the principal features. 3
I noticed the low, slanting roof, the huge enlarged dormer, the curios and 3
trophies hung on the wall - and most of all, the great shrouded easel in the centre 3
of the floor. To that easel de Russy now walked, drawing aside the dusty velvet 3
hangings on the side turned away from me, and motioning me silently to 3
approach. It took a good deal of courage to make me obey, especially when I saw 3
how my guide's eyes dilated in the wavering candle light as he looked at the 3
3
3
3
1014 3
3
3
3
unveiled canvas. But again curiosity conquered everything, and I walked around 3
to where de Russy stood. Then I saw the damnable thing. 3
3
I did not faint - though no reader can possibly realise the effort it took to keep me 3
from doing so. I did cry out, but stopped short when I saw the frightened look on 3
the old man's face, as I had expected, the canvas was warped, mouldy, and 3
scabrous from dampness and neglect; but for all that I could trace the monstrous 3
hints of evil cosmic outsideness that lurked all through the nameless scene's 3
morbid content and perverted geometry. 3
3
It was as the old man had said - a vaulted, columned hell of mungled Black 3
Masses and Witches' Sabbaths - and what perfect completion could have added 3
to it was beyond my power to guess. Decay had only increased the utter 3
hideousness of its wicked symbolism and diseased suggestion, for the parts most 3
affected by time were just those parts of the picture which in Nature - or in the 3
extra-cosmic realm that mocked Nature - would be apt to decay and disintegrate. 3
3
The utmost horror of all, of course, was Marceline - and as I saw the bloated, 3
discoloured flesh I formed the odd fancy that perhaps the figure on the canvas 3
had some obscure, occult linkage with the figure which lay in quicklime under 3
the cellar floor. Perhaps the lime had preserved the corpse instead of destroying 3
it - but could it have preserved those black, malign eyes that glared and mocked 3
at me from their painted hell? 3
3
And there was something else about the creature which I could not fail to notice - 3
something which de Russy had not been able to put into words, but which 3
perhaps had something to do with Denis' wish to kill all those of his blood who 3
had dwelt under the same roof with her. Whether Marsh knew, or whether the 3
genius in him painted it without his knowing, none could say. But Denis and his 3
father could not have known till they saw the picture. 3
3
Surpassing all in horror was the streaming black hair - which covered the rotting 3
body, but which was itself not even slightly decayed. All I had heard of it was 3
amply verified. It was nothing human, this ropy, sinuous, half-oily, half-crinkly 3
flood of serpent darkness. Vile, independent life proclaimed itself at every 3
unnatural twist and convolution, and the suggestion of numberless reptilian 3
heads at the out-turned ends was far too marked to be illusory or accidental. 3
3
The blasphemous thing held me like a magnet. I was helpless, and did not 3
wonder at the myth of the gorgon's glance which turned all beholders to stone. 3
Then I thought I saw a change come over the thing. The leering features 3
perceptibly moved, so that the rotting jaw fell, allowing the thick, beast-like lips 3
to disclose a row of pointed yellow fangs. The pupils of the fiendish eyes dilated. 3
3
3
3
1015 3
3
3
3
and the eyes themselves seemed to bulge outward. And the hair - that accursed 3
hair! It had begun to rustle and wave perceptibly, the snake-heads all turning 3
toward de Russy and vibrating as if to strike! 3
3
Reason deserted me altogether, and before I knew what I was doing I drew my 3
automatic and sent a shower of twelve steel-jacketed bullets through the 3
shocking canvas. The whole thing at once fell to pieces, even the frame toppling 3
from the easel and clattering to the dust-covered floor. But though this horror 3
was shattered, another had risen before me in the form of de Russy himself, 3
whose maddened shrieks as he saw the picture vanish were almost as terrible as 3
the picture itself had been. 3
3
With a half-articulate scream of "God, now you've done it!" the frantic old man 3
seized me violently by the arm and commenced to drag me out of the room and 3
down the rickety stairs. He had dropped the candle in his panic; but dawn was 3
near, and some faint grey light was filtering in through the dust-covered 3
windows. I tripped and stumbled repeatedly, but never for a moment would my 3
guide slacken his pace. 3
3
"Run!" he shrieked, "run for your life! You don't know what you've done! I 3
never told you the whole thing! There were things I had to do - the picture talked 3
to me and told me. I had to guard and keep it - now the worst will happen! She 3
and that hair will come up out of their graves, for God knows what purpose! 3
3
"Hurry, man! For God's sake let's get out of here while there's time. If you have a 3
car take me along to Cape Girardeau with you. It may well get me in the end, 3
anywhere, but I'll give it a run for its money. Out of here - quick!" 3
3
As we reached the ground floor I became aware of a slow, curious thumping 3
from the rear of the house, followed by a sound of a door shutting. De Russy had 3
not heard the thumping, but the other noise caught his ear and drew from him 3
the most terrible shriek that ever sounded in human throat. 3
3
"Oh, God - great God - that was the cellar door - she's coming - " 3
3
By this time I was desperately wrestling with the rusty latch and sagging hinges 3
of the great front door - almost as frantic as my host now that I heard the slow, 3
thumping tread approaching from the unknown rear rooms of the accursed 3
mansion. The night's rain had warped the oaken planks, and the heavy door 3
stuck and resisted even more strongly than it had when I forced an entrance the 3
evening before. 3
3
3
3
1016 3
3
3
3
Somewhere a plank creaked beneath the foot of whatever was walking, and the 3
sound seemed to snap the last cord of sanity in the poor old man. With a roar like 3
that of a maddened bull he released his grip on me and made a plunge to the 3
right, through the open door of a room which I judged had been a parlour. A 3
second later, just as I got the front door open and was making my own escape, I 3
heard the tinkling clatter of broken glass and knew he had leapt through a 3
window. And as I bounded off the sagging porch to commence my mad race 3
down the long, weed-grown drive I thought I could catch the thud of dead, 3
dogged footsteps which did not follow me, but which kept leadenly on through 3
the door of the cobwebbed parlour. 3
3
I looked backward only twice as I plunged heedlessly through the burrs and 3
briers of that abandoned drive, past the dying lindens and grotesque scrub-oaks, 3
in the grey pallor of a cloudy November dawn. The first time was when an acrid 3
smell overtook me, and I thought of the candle de Russy had dropped in the attic 3
studio. By then I was comfortably near the road, on the high place from which 3
the roof of the distant house was clearly visible above its encircling trees; and just 3
as I expected, thick clouds of smoke were billowing out of the attic dormers and 3
curling upward into the leaden heavens. I thanked the powers of creation that an 3
immemorial curse was about to be purged by fire and blotted from the earth. 3
3
But in the next instant came that second backward look in which I glimpsed two 3
other things - things that cancelled most of the relief and gave me a supreme 3
shock from which I shall never recover. I have said that I was on a high part of 3
the drive, from which much of the plantation behind me was visible. This vista 3
included not only the house and its trees but some of the abandoned and partly 3
flooded land beside the river, and several bends of the weed-choked drive I had 3
been so hastily traversing. In both of these latter places 1 1 now beheld sights - or 3
suspicions of sights - which I wish devoutly I could deny. It was a faint, distant 3
scream which made me turn back again, and as I did so I caught a trace of 3
motion on the dull grey marshy plain behind the house. At that human figures 3
are very small, yet I thought the motion resolved itself into two of these - pursuer 3
and pursued. I even thought I saw the dark-clothed leading figure overtaken, 3
seized, and dragged violently in the direction of the now burning house. 3
3
But I could not watch the outcome, for at once a nearer sight obtruded itself - a 3
suggestion of motion among the underbrush at a point some distance back along 3
the deserted drive. Unmistakably, the weeds and bushes and briers were 3
swaying as no wind could sway them; swaying as if some large, swift serpent 3
were wriggling purposefully along on the ground in pursuit of me. 3
3
That was all I could stand. I scrambled along madly for the gate, heedless of torn 3
clothing and bleeding scratches, and jumped into the roadster parked under the 3
3
3
3
1017 3
3
3
3
great evergreen tree. It was a bedraggled, rain- drenched sight; but the works 3
were unharmed and I had no trouble in starting the thing. I went on blindly in 3
the direction the car was headed for; nothing was in my mind but to get away 3
from that frightful region of nightmares and cacodaemons - to get away as 3
quickly and as far as gasoline could take me. 3
3
About three or four miles along the road a farmer hailed me - a kindly, drawling 3
fellow of middle age and considerable native intelligence. I was glad to slow 3
down and ask directions, though I knew I must present a strange enough aspect. 3
The man readily told me the way to Cape Girardeau, and inquired where I had 3
come from in such a state at such an early hour. Thinking it best to say little, I 3
merely mentioned that I had been caught in the night's rain and had taken 3
shelter at a nearby farmhouse, afterward losing my way in the underbrush trying 3
to find my car. 3
3
"At a farmhouse, eh? Wonder whose it could'a been. Ain't nothin' standin' this 3
side o' Jim Ferris' place acrost Barker's Crick, an' that's all o' twenty miles by the 3
rud." 3
3
I gave a start, and wondered what fresh mystery this portended. Then I asked 3
my informant if he had overlooked the large ruined plantation house whose 3
ancient gate bordered the road not far back. 3
3
"Funny ye sh'd recoUeck that, stranger! Must a ben here afore some time. But 3
that house ain't here now. Burnt down five or six years ago - and they did tell 3
some queer stories about it." 3
3
I shuddered. 3
3
"You mean Riverside - ol' man de Russy's place. Queer goin's on there fifteen or 3
twenty years ago. Ol' man's boy married a gal from abroad, and some folks 3
thought she was a mighty odd sort. Didn't like the looks of her. then she and the 3
boy went off sudden, and later on the ol' man said he was kilt in the war. But 3
some o' the niggers hinted queer things. Got around at last that the ol' fellow fell 3
in love with the gal himself and kilt her and the boy. That place was sure enough 3
haunted by a black snake, mean that what it may. 3
3
"Then five or six years ago the ol' man disappeared and the house burned down. 3
Some do say he was burnt up in it. It was a mornin' after a rainy night just like 3
this, when lots o' folks heard an awful yellin' across the fields in old de Russy's 3
voice. When they stopped and looked, they see the house goin' up in smoke 3
quick as a wink - that place was all like tinder anyhow, rain or no rain. Nobody 3
3
3
3
1018 3
3
3
3
never seen the ol' man again, but onct in a while they tell of the ghost of that big 3
black snake glidin' aroun'. 3
3
"What d'ye make of it, anyhow? You seem to hev knowed the place. Didn't ye 3
ever hear tell of the de Russys? What d'ye reckon was the trouble with that gal 3
young Denis married? She kinder made everybody shiver and feel hateful, 3
though ye' couldn't never tell why." 3
3
I was trying to think, but that process was almost beyond me now. The house 3
burned down years ago? Then where, and under what conditions, had I passed 3
the night? And why did I know what I knew of these things? Even as I pondered 3
I saw a hair on my coat sleeve - the short, grey hair of an old man. 3
3
In the end I drove on without telling anything. But did I hint that gossip was 3
wronging the poor old planter who had suffered so much. I made it clear - as if 3
from distant but authentic reports wafted among friends - that if anyone was to 3
blame for the trouble at Riverside it was the woman, Marceline. She was not 3
suited to Missouri ways, I said, and it was too bad that Denis had ever married 3
her. 3
3
More I did not intimate, for I felt that the de Russys, with their proudly cherished 3
honour and high, sensitive spirits, would not wish me to say more. They had 3
borne enough, God knows, without the countryside guessing what a daemon of 3
the pit - what a gorgon of the elder blasphemies - had come to flaunt their 3
ancient and stainless name. 3
3
Nor was it right that the neighbours should know that other horror which my 3
strange host of the night could not bring himself to tell me - that horror which he 3
must have learned, as I learned it, from details in the lost masterpiece of poor 3
Frank Marsh. 3
3
It would be too hideous if they knew that the one-time heiress of Riverside - the 3
accursed gorgon or lamia whose hateful crinkly coil of serpent-hair must even 3
now be brooding and twining vampirically around an artist's skeleton in a lime- 3
packed grave beneath a charred foundation - was faintly, subtly, yet to the eyes 3
of genius unmistakably the scion of Zimbabwe's most primal grovellers. No 3
wonder she owned a link with that old witch-woman - for, though in deceitfully 3
slight proportion, Marceline was a negress. 3

Out of the Aeons - with Hazel Heald 3
3
Written 1933 3
3
(Ms. found among the effects of the late Richard H. Johnson, Ph.D., curator of the 3
Cabot Museum of Archaeology, Boston, Mass.) 3
3
It is not likely that anyone in Boston - or any alert reader elsewhere - will ever 3
forget the strange affair of the Cabot Museum. The newspaper publicity given to 3
that hellish mummy, the antique and terrible rumours vaguely linked with it, the 3
morbid wave of interest and cult activities during 1932, and the frightful fate of 3
the two intruders on December 1st of that year, all combined to form one of those 3
classic mysteries which go down for generations as folklore and become the 3
nuclei of whole cycles of horrific speculation. 3
3
Everyone seems to realise, too, that something very vital and unutterably 3
hideous was suppressed in the public accounts of the culminant horrors. Those 3
first disquieting hints as to the condition of one of the two bodies were dismissed 3
and ignored too abruptly - nor were the singular modifications in the mummy 3
given the following-up which their news value would normally prompt. It also 3
struck people as queer that the mummy was never restored to its case. In these 3
days of expert taxidermy the excuse that its disintegrating condition made 3
exhibition impracticable seemed a peculiarly lame one. 3
3
As curator of the museum I am in a position to reveal all the suppressed facts, 3
but this I shall not do during my lifetime. There are things about the world and 3
universe which it is better for the majority not to know, and I have not departed 3
from the opinion in which all of us - museum staff, physicians, reporters, and 3
police - concurred at the period of the horror itself. At the same time it seems 3
proper that a matter of such overwhelming scientific and historic importance 3
should not remain wholly unrecorded - hence this account which I have 3
prepared for the benefit of serious students. I shall place it among various papers 3
to be examined after my death, leaving its fate to the discretion of my executors. 3
Certain threats and unusual events during the past weeks have led me to believe 3
that my life - as well as that of other museum officials - is in some peril through 3
the enmity of several widespread secret cults of Asiatics, Polynesians, and 3
heterogeneous mystical devotees; hence it is possible that the work of the 3
executors may not be long postponed. [Executor's note: Dr. Johnson died 3
suddenly and rather mysteriously of heart-failure on April 22, 1933. Wentworth 3
Moore, taxidermist of the museum, disappeared around the middle of the 3
preceding month. On February 18 of the same year Dr. William Minot, who 3
3
3
3
1020 3
3
3
3
superintended a dissection connected with the case, was stabbed in the back, 3
dying the following day.] 3
3
The real beginning of the horror, I suppose, was in 1879 - long before my term as 3
curator - when the museum acquired that ghastly, inexplicable mummy from the 3
Orient Shipping Company. Its very discovery was monstrous and menacing, for 3
it came from a crypt of unknown origin and fabulous antiquity on a bit of land 3
suddenly upheaved from the Pacific's floor. 3
3
On May 11, 1878, Capt. Charles Weatherbee of the freighter Eridanus, bound 3
from Wellington, New Zealand, to Valparaiso, Chile, had sighted a new island 3
unmarked on any chart and evidently of volcanic origin. It projected quite boldly 3
out of the sea in the form of a truncated cone. A landing-party under Capt. 3
Weatherbee noted evidences of long submersion on the rugged slopes which 3
they climbed, while at the summit there were signs of recent destruction, as by 3
an earthquake. Among the scattered rubble were massive stones of manifestly 3
artificial shaping, and a little examination disclosed the presence of some of that 3
prehistoric Cyclopean masonry found on certain Pacific islands and forming a 3
perpetual archaeological puzzle. 3
3
Finally the sailors entered a massive stone crypt - judged to have been part of a 3
much larger edifice, and to have originally lain far underground - in one corner 3
of which the frightful mummy crouched. After a short period of virtual panic, 3
caused partly by certain carvings on the walls, the men were induced to move 3
the mummy to the ship, though it was only with fear and loathing that they 3
touched it. Close to the body, as if once thrust into its clothes, was a cylinder of 3
an unknown metal containing a roll of thin, bluish- white membrane of equally 3
unknown nature, inscribed with peculiar characters in a greyish, indeterminable 3
pigment. In the centre of the vast stone floor was a suggestion of a trap-door, but 3
the party lacked apparatus sufficiently powerful to move it. 3
3
The Cabot Museum, then newly established, saw the meagre reports of the 3
discovery and at once took steps to acquire the mummy and the cylinder. 3
Curator Pickman made a personal trip to Valparaiso and outfitted a schooner to 3
search for the crypt where the thing had been found, though meeting with failure 3
in this matter. At the recorded position of the island nothing but the sea's 3
unbroken expanse could be discerned, and the seekers realised that the same 3
seismic forces which had suddenly thrust the island up had carried it down 3
again to the watery darkness where it had brooded for untold aeons. The secret 3
of that immovable trap-door would never be solved. The mummy and the 3
cylinder, however, remained - and the former was placed on exhibition early in 3
November, 1879, in the museum's hall of mummies. 3

3
The Cabot Museum of Archaeology, which speciahses in such remnants of 3
ancient and unknown civihsations as do not fall within the domain of art, is a 3
small and scarcely famous institution, though one of high standing in scientific 3
circles. It stands in the heart of Boston's exclusive Beacon Hill district - in Mt. 3
Vernon Street, near Joy - housed in a former private mansion with an added 3
wing in the rear, and was a source of pride to its austere neighbours until the 3
recent terrible events brought it an undesirable notoriety. The hall of mummies 3
on the western side of the original mansion (which was designed by Bulfinch 3
and erected in 1819), on the second floor, is justly esteemed by historians and 3
anthropologists as harbouring the greatest collection of its kind in America. Here 3
may be found typical examples of Egyptian embalming from the earliest 3
Sakkarah specimens to the last Coptic attempts of the eighth century; mummies 3
of other cultures, including the prehistoric Indian specimens recently found in 3
the Aleutian Islands; agonised Pompeian figures moulded in plaster from tragic 3
hollows in the ruin choking ashes; naturally mummified bodies from mines and 3
other excavations in all parts of the earth - some surprised by their terrible 3
entombment in the grotesque postures caused by their last, tearing death-throes - 3
everything, in short, which any collection of the sort could well be expected to 3
contain. In 1879, of course, it was much less ample than it is now; yet even then it 3
was remarkable. But that shocking thing from the primal Cyclopean crypt on an 3
ephemeral sea-spawned island was always its chief attraction and most 3
impenetrable mystery. 3
3
The mummy was that of a medium-sized man of unknown race, and was cast in 3
a peculiar crouching posture. The face, half shielded by claw -like hands, had its 3
under jaw thrust far forward, while the shrivelled features bore an expression of 3
fright so hideous that few spectators could view them unmoved. The eyes were 3
closed, with lids clamped down tightly over eyeballs apparently bulging and 3
prominent. Bits of hair and beard remained, and the colour of the whole was a 3
sort of dull neutral grey. In texture the thing was half leathery and half stony, 3
forming an insoluble enigma to those experts who sought to ascertain how it was 3
embalmed. In places bits of its substance were eaten away by time and decay. 3
Rags of some peculiar fabric, with suggestions of unknown designs, still clung to 3
the object. 3
3
Just what made it so infinitely horrible and repulsive one could hardly say. For 3
one thing, there was a subtle, indefinable sense of limitless antiquity and utter 3
alienage which affected one like a view from the brink of a monstrous abyss of 3
unplumbed blackness - but mostly it was the expression of crazed fear on the 3
puckered, prognathous, half-shielded face. Such a symbol of infinite, inhuman, 3
cosmic fright could not help communicating the emotion to the beholder amidst 3
a disquieting cloud of mystery and vain conjecture. 3
3
3
3
1022 3
3
3
3
Among the discriminating few who frequented the Cabot Museum this reHc of 3
an elder, forgotten world soon acquired an unholy fame, though the institution's 3
seclusion and quiet policy prevented it from becoming a popular sensation of the 3
"Cardiff Giant" sort. In the last century the art of vulgar ballyhoo had not 3
invaded the field of scholarship to the extent it has now succeeded in doing. 3
Naturally, savants of various kinds tried their best to classify the frightful object, 3
though always without success. Theories of a bygone Pacific civilisation, of 3
which the Easter Island images and the megalithic masonry of Ponape and Nan- 3
Matol are conceivable vestiges, were freely circulated among students, and 3
learned journals carried varied and often conflicting speculations on a possible 3
former continent whose peaks survive as the myriad islands of Melanesia and 3
Polynesia. The diversity in dates assigned to the hypothetical vanished culture - 3
or continent - was at once bewildering and amusing; yet some surprisingly 3
relevant allusions were found in certain myths of Tahiti and other islands. 3
3
Meanwhile the strange cylinder and its baffling scroll of unknown hieroglyphs, 3
carefully preserved in the museum library, received their due share of attention. 3
No question could exist as to their association with the mummy; hence all 3
realised that in the unravelling of their mystery the mystery of the shrivelled 3
horror would in all probability be unravelled as well. The cylinder, about four 3
inches long by seven-eighths of an inch in diameter, was of a queerly iridescent 3
metal utterly defying chemical analysis and seemingly impervious to all 3
reagents. It was tightly fitted with a cap of the same substance, and bore 3
engraved figurings of an evidently decorative and possibly symbolic nature - 3
conventional designs which seemed to follow a peculiarly alien, paradoxical, and 3
doubtfully describable system of geometry. 3
3
Not less mysterious was the scroll it contained - a neat roll of some thin, bluish- 3
white, unanalysable membrane, coiled round a slim rod of metal like that of the 3
cylinder, and unwinding to a length of some two feet. The large, bold 3
hieroglyphs, extending in a narrow line down the centre of the scroll and penned 3
or painted with a grey pigment defying analysts, resembled nothing known to 3
linguists and palaeographers, and could not be deciphered despite the 3
transmission of photographic copies to every living expert in the given field. 3
3
It is true that a few scholars, unusually versed in the literature of occultism and 3
magic, found vague resemblances between some of the hieroglyphs and certain 3
primal symbols described or cited in two or three very ancient, obscure, and 3
esoteric texts such as the Book of Eibon, reputed to descend from forgotten 3
Hyperborea; the Pnakotic fragments, alleged to be pre-human; and the 3
monstrous and forbidden Necronomicon of the mad Arab Abdul Alhazred. 3
None of these resemblances, however, was beyond dispute; and because of the 3
prevailing low estimation of occult studies, no effort was made to circulate 3
3
3
3
1023 3
3
3
3
copies of the hieroglyphs among mystical specialists. Had such circulation 3
occurred at this early date, the later history of the case might have been very 3
different; indeed, a glance at the hieroglyphs by any reader of von Junzt's 3
horrible Nameless Cults would have established a linkage of unmistakable 3
significance. At this period, however, the readers of that monstrous blasphemy 3
were exceedingly few; copies having been incredibly scarce in the interval 3
between the suppression of the original Dusseldorf edition (1839) and of the 3
Bridewell translation (1845) and the publication of the expurgated reprint by the 3
Golden Goblin Press in 1909. Practically speaking, no occultist or student of the 3
primal past's esoteric lore had his attention called to the strange scroll until the 3
recent outburst of sensational journalism which precipitated the horrible climax. 3
3
II. 3
3
Thus matters glided along for a half-century following the installation of the 3
frightful mummy at the museum. The gruesome object had a local celebrity 3
among cultivated Bostonians, but no more than that; while the very existence of 3
the cylinder and scroll - after a decade of futile research - was virtually forgotten. 3
So quiet and conservative was the Cabot Museum that no reporter or feature 3
writer ever thought of invading its uneventful precincts for rabble-tickling 3
material. 3
3
The invasion of ballyhoo commenced in the spring of 1931, when a purchase of 3
somewhat spectacular nature - that of the strange objects and inexplicably 3
preserved bodies found in crypts beneath the almost vanished and evilly famous 3
ruins of Chateau Faussesflammes, in Averoigne, France - brought the museum 3
prominently into the news columns. True to its "hustling" policy, the Boston 3
Pillar sent a Sunday feature writer to cover the incident and pad it with an 3
exaggerated general account of the institution itself; and this young man - Stuart 3
Reynolds by name - hit upon the nameless mummy as a potential sensation far 3
surpassing the recent acquisitions nominally forming his chief assignment. A 3
smattering of theosophical lore, and a fondness for the speculations of such 3
writers as Colonel Churchward and Lewis Spence concerning lost continents and 3
primal forgotten civilisations, made Reynolds especially alert toward any 3
aeonian relic like the unknown mummy. 3
3
At the museum the reporter made himself a nuisance through constant and not 3
always intelligent questionings and endless demands for the movement of 3
encased objects to permit photographs from unusual angles. In the basement 3
library room he pored endlessly over the strange metal cylinder and its 3
membraneous scroll, photographing them from every angle and securing 3
pictures of every bit of the weird hieroglyphed text. He likewise asked to see all 3
books with any bearing whatever on the subject of primal cultures and sunken 3
3
3
3
1024 3
3
3
3
continents - sitting for three hours taking notes, and leaving only in order to 3
hasten to Cambridge for a sight (if permission were granted) of the abhorred and 3
forbidden Necronomicon at the Widener Library. 3
3
On April 5th the article appeared in the Sunday Pillar, smothered in photographs 3
of mummy, cylinder, and hieroglyphed scroll, and couched in the peculiarly 3
simpering, infantile style which the Pillar affects for the benefit of its vast and 3
mentally immature clientele. Full of inaccuracies, exaggerations, and 3
sensationalism, it was precisely the sort of thing to stir the brainless and fickle 3
interest of the herd - and as a result the once quiet museum began to be swarmed 3
with chattering and vacuously staring throngs such as its stately corridors had 3
never known before. 3
3
There were scholarly and intelligent visitors, too, despite the puerility of the 3
article - the pictures had spoken for themselves - and many persons of mature 3
attainments sometimes see the Pillar by accident. I recall one very strange 3
character who appeared during November - a dark, turbaned, and bushily 3
bearded man with a laboured, unnatural voice, curiously expressionless face, 3
clumsy hands covered with absurd white mittens, who gave a squalid West End 3
address and called himself "Swami Chandraputra". This fellow was 3
unbelievably erudite in occult lore and seemed profoundly and solemnly moved 3
by the resemblance of the hieroglyphs on the scroll to certain signs and symbols 3
of a forgotten elder world about which he professed vast intuitive knowledge. 3
3
By June, the fame of the mummy and scroll had leaked far beyond Boston, and 3
the museum had inquiries and requests for photographs from occultists and 3
students of arcana all over the world. This was not altogether pleasing to our 3
staff, since we are a scientific institution without sympathy for fantastic 3
dreamers; yet we answered all questions with civility. One result of these 3
catechisms was a highly learned article in The Occult Review by the famous New 3
Orleans mystic Etienne-Laurent de Marigny, in which was asserted the complete 3
identity of some of the odd geometrical designs on the iridescent cylinder, and of 3
several of the hieroglyphs on the membraneous scroll, with certain ideographs of 3
horrible significance (transcribed from primal monoliths or from the secret 3
rituals of hidden bands of esoteric students and devotees) reproduced in the 3
hellish and suppressed Black Book or Nameless Cults of von Junzt. 3
3
De Marigny recalled the frightful death of von Junzt in 1840, a year after the 3
publication of his terrible volume at Dusseldorf, and commented on his blood- 3
curdling and partly suspected sources of information. Above all, he emphasised 3
the enormous relevance of the tales with which von Junzt linked most of the 3
monstrous ideographs he had reproduced. That these tales, in which a cylinder 3
and scroll were expressly mentioned, held a remarkable suggestion of 3
3
3
3
1025 3
3
3
3
relationship to the things at the museum, no one could deny; yet they were of 3
such breath-taking extravagance - involving such unbelievable sweeps of time 3
and such fantastic anomalies of a forgotten elder world - that one could much 3
more easily admire than believe them. 3
3
Admire them the public certainly did, for copying in the press was universal. 3
Illustrated articles sprang up everywhere, telling or purporting to tell the legends 3
in the Black Book, expatiating on the horror of the mummy, comparing the 3
cylinder's designs and the scroll's hieroglyphs with the figures reproduced by 3
von Junzt, and indulging in the wildest, most sensational, and most irrational 3
theories and speculations. Attendance at the museum was trebled, and the 3
widespread nature of the interest was attested by the plethora of mail on the 3
subject - most of it inane and superfluous - received at the museum. Apparently 3
the mummy and its origin formed - for imaginative people - a close rival to the 3
depression as chief topic of 1931 and 1932. For my own part, the principal effect 3
of the furore was to make me read von Junzt's monstrous volume in the Golden 3
Goblin edition - a perusal which left me dizzy and nauseated, yet thankful that I 3
had not seen the utter infamy of the unexpurgated text. 3
3
III. 3
3
The archaic whispers reflected in the Black Book, and linked with designs and 3
symbols so closely akin to what the mysterious scroll and cylinder bore, were 3
indeed of a character to hold one spellbound and not a little awestruck. Leaping 3
an incredible gulf of time - behind all the civilisations, races, and lands we know 3
- they clustered round a vanished nation and a vanished continent of the misty, 3
fabulous dawn-years . . . that to which legend has given the name of Mu, and 3
which old tablets in the primal Naacal tongue speak of as flourishing 200,000 3
years ago, when Europe harboured only hybrid entities, and lost Hyperborea 3
knew the nameless worship of black amorphous Tsathoggua. 3
3
There was mention of a kingdom or province called K'naa in a very ancient land 3
where the first human people had found monstrous ruins left by those who had 3
dwelt there before - vague waves of unknown entities which had filtered down 3
from the stars and lived out their aeons on a forgotten, nascent world. K'naa was 3
a sacred place, since from its midst the bleak basalt cliffs of Mount Yaddith-Gho 3
soared starkly into the sky, topped by a gigantic fortress of Cyclopean stone, 3
infinitely older than mankind and built by the alien spawn of the dark planet 3
Yuggoth, which had colonised the earth before the birth of terrestrial life. 3
3
The spawn of Yuggoth had perished aeons before, but had left behind them one 3
monstrous and terrible living thing which could never die - their hellish god or 3
patron daemon Ghatanothoa, which glowered and brooded eternally though 3
3
3
3
1026 3
3
3
3
unseen in the crypts beneath that fortress on Yaddith-Gho. No human creature 3
had ever cHmbed Yaddith-Gho or seen that blasphemous fortress except as a 3
distant and geometrically abnormal outline against the sky; yet most agreed that 3
Ghatanothoa was still there, wallowing and burrowing in unsuspected abysses 3
beneath the megalithic walls. There were always those who believed that 3
sacrifices must be made to Ghatanothoa, lest it crawl out of its hidden abysses 3
and waddle horribly through the world of men as it had once waddled through 3
the primal world of the Yuggoth-spawn. 3
3
People said that if no victims were offered, Ghatanothoa would ooze up to the 3
light of day and lumber down the basalt cliffs of Yaddith-Gho bringing doom to 3
all it might encounter. For no living thing could behold Ghatanothoa, or even a 3
perfect graven image of Ghatanothoa, however small, without suffering a change 3
more horrible than death itself. Sight of the god, or its image, as all the legends of 3
the Yuggoth- spawn agreed, meant paralysis and petrifaction of a singularly 3
shocking sort, in which the victim was turned to stone and leather on the outside, 3
while the brain within remained perpetually alive - horribly fixed and prisoned 3
through the ages, and maddeningly conscious of the passage of interminable 3
epochs of helpless inaction till chance and time might complete the decay of the 3
petrified shell and leave it exposed to die. Most brains, of course, would go mad 3
long before this aeon-deferred release could arrive. No human eyes, it was said, 3
had ever glimpsed Ghatanothoa, though the danger was as great now as it had 3
been for the Yuggoth-spawn. 3
3
And so there was a cult in K'naa which worshipped Ghatanothoa and each year 3
sacrificed to it twelve young warriors and twelve young maidens. These victims 3
were offered up on flaming altars in the marble temple near the mountain's base, 3
for none dared climb Yaddith-Gho's basalt cliffs or draw near to the Cyclopean 3
prehuman stronghold on its crest. Vast was the power of the priests of 3
Ghatanothoa, since upon them alone depended the preservation of K'naa and of 3
all the land of Mu from the petrifying emergence of Ghatanothoa out of its 3
unknown burrows. 3
3
There were in the land an hundred priests of the Dark God, under Imash-Mo the 3
High-Priest, who walked before King Thabon at the Nath-feast, and stood 3
proudly whilst the King knelt at the Dhoric shrine. Each priest had a marble 3
house, a chest of gold, two hundred slaves, and an hundred concubines, besides 3
immunity from civil law and the power of life and death over all in K'naa save 3
the priests of the King. Yet in spite of these defenders there was ever a fear in the 3
land lest Ghatanothoa slither up from the depths and lurch viciously down the 3
mountain to bring horror and petrification to mankind. In the latter years the 3
priests forbade men even to guess or imagine what its frightful aspect might be. 3
3
3
3
1027 3
3
3
3
It was in the Year of the Red Moon (estimated as B.C. 173,148 by von Junzt) that a 3
human being first dared to breathe defiance against Ghatanothoa and its 3
nameless menace. This bold heretic was T'yog, High-Priest of Shub-Niggurath 3
and guardian of the copper temple of the Goat with a Thousand Young. T'yog 3
had thought long on the powers of the various gods, and had had strange 3
dreams and revelations touching the life of this and earlier worlds. In the end he 3
felt sure that the gods friendly to man could be arrayed against the hostile gods, 3
and believed that Shub-Niggurath, Nug, and Yeb, as well as Yig the Serpent-god, 3
were ready to take sides with man against the tyranny and presumption of 3
Ghatanothoa. 3
3
Inspired by the Mother Goddess, T'yog wrote down a strange formula in the 3
hieratic Naacal of his order, which he believed would keep the possessor 3
immune from the Dark God's petrifying power. With this protection, he 3
reflected, it might be possible for a bold man to climb the dreaded basalt cliffs 3
and - first of all human beings - enter the Cyclopean fortress beneath which 3
Ghatanothoa reputedly brooded. Face to face with the god, and with the power 3
of Shub-Niggurath and her sons on his side, T'yog believed that he might be able 3
to bring it to terms and at last deliver mankind from its brooding menace. With 3
humanity freed through his efforts, there would be no limits to the honours he 3
might claim. All the honours of the priests of Ghatanothoa would perforce be 3
transferred to him; and even kingship or godhood might conceivably be within 3
his reach. 3
3
So T'yog wrote his protective formula on a scroll of pthagon membrane 3
(according to von Junzt, the inner skin of the extinct ya-kith-lizard) and enclosed 3
it in a carven cylinder of lagh metal - the metal brought by the Elder Ones from 3
Yuggoth, and found in no mine of earth. This charm, carried in his robe, would 3
make him proof against the menace of Ghatanothoa - it would even restore the 3
Dark God's petrified victims if that monstrous entity should ever emerge and 3
begin its devastations. Thus he proposed to go up the shunned and man- 3
untrodden mountain, invade the alien-angled citadel of Cyclopean stone, and 3
confront the shocking devil-entity in its lair. Of what would follow, he could not 3
even guess; but the hope of being mankind's saviour lent strength to his will. 3
3
He had, however, reckoned without the jealousy and self-interest of 3
Ghatanothoa's pampered priests. No sooner did they hear of his plan than - 3
fearful for their prestige and privilege in case the Daemon-God should be 3
dethroned - they set up a frantic clamour against the so-called sacrilege, crying 3
that no man might prevail against Ghatanothoa, and that any effort to seek it out 3
would merely provoke it to a hellish onslaught against mankind which no spell 3
or priestcraft could hope to avert. With those cries they hoped to turn the public 3
mind against T'yog; yet such was the people's yearning for freedom from 3
3
3
3
1028 3
3
3
3
Ghatanothoa, and such their confidence in the skill and zeal of T'yog, that all the 3
protestations came to naught. Even the King, usually a puppet of the priests, 3
refused to forbid T'yog's daring pilgrimage. 3
3
It was then that the priests of Ghatanothoa did by stealth what they could not do 3
openly. One night Imash- Mo, the High-Priest, stole to T'yog in his temple 3
chamber and took from his sleeping form the metal cylinder; silently drawing 3
out the potent scroll and putting in its place another scroll of great similitude, yet 3
varied enough to have no power against any god or daemon. When the cylinder 3
was slipped back into the sleeper's cloak Imash-Mo was content, for he knew 3
T'yog was little likely to study that cylinder's contents again. Thinking himself 3
protected by the true scroll, the heretic would march up the forbidden mountain 3
and into the Evil Presence - and Ghatanothoa, unchecked by any magic, would 3
take care of the rest. 3
3
It would no longer be needful for Ghatanothoa's priests to preach against the 3
defiance. Let T'yog go his way and meet his doom. And secretly, the priests 3
would always cherish the stolen scroll - the true and potent charm - handing it 3
down from one High-Priest to another for use in any dim future when it might 3
be needful to contravene the Devil-God's will. So the rest of the night Imash-Mo 3
slept in great peace, with the true scroll in a new cylinder fashioned for its 3
harbourage. 3
3
It was dawn on the Day of the Sky-Flames (nomenclature undefined by von 3
Junzt) that T'yog, amidst the prayers and chanting of the people and with King 3
Thabon's blessing on his head, started up the dreaded mountain with a staff of 3
tlath-wood in his right hand. Within his robe was the cylinder holding what he 3
thought to be the true charm - for he had indeed failed to find out the imposture. 3
Nor did he see any irony in the prayers which Imash-Mo and the other priests of 3
Ghatanothoa intoned for his safety and success. 3
3
All that morning the people stood and watched as T'yog's dwindling form 3
struggled up the shunned basalt slope hitherto alien to men's footsteps, and 3
many stayed watching long after he had vanished where a perilous ledge led 3
round to the mountain's hidden side. That night a few sensitive dreamers 3
thought they heard a faint tremor convulsing the hated peak; though most 3
ridiculed them for the statement. Next day vast crowds watched the mountain 3
and prayed, and wondered how soon T'yog would return. And so the next day, 3
and the next. For weeks they hoped and waited, and then they wept. Nor did 3
anyone ever see T'yog, who would have saved mankind from fears, again. 3
3
Thereafter men shuddered at T'yog's presumption, and tried not to think of the 3
punishment his impiety had met. And the priests of Ghatanothoa smiled to those 3
3
3
3
1029 3
3
3
3
who might resent the god's will or challenge its right to the sacrifices. In later 3
years the ruse of Imash-Mo became known to the people; yet the knowledge 3
availed not to change the general feeling that Ghatanothoa were better left alone. 3
None ever dared to defy it again. And so the ages rolled on, and King succeeded 3
King, and High-Priest succeeded High-Priest, and nations rose and decayed, and 3
lands rose above the sea and returned into the sea. And with many millennia 3
decay fell upon K'naa - till at last on a hideous day of storm and thunder, terrific 3
rumbling, and mountain-high waves, all the land of Mu sank into the sea forever. 3
3
Yet down the later aeons thin streams of ancient secrets trickled. In distant lands 3
there met together grey- faced fugitives who had survived the sea-fiend's rage, 3
and strange skies drank the smoke of altars reared to vanished gods and 3
daemons. Though none knew to what bottomless deep the sacred peak and 3
Cyclopean fortress of dreaded Ghatanothoa had sunk, there were still those who 3
mumbled its name and offered to it nameless sacrifices lest it bubble up through 3
leagues of ocean and shamble among men spreading horror and petrifaction. 3
3
Around the scattered priests grew the rudiments of a dark and secret cult - secret 3
because the people of the new lands had other gods and devils, and thought only 3
evil of elder and alien ones - and within that cult many hideous things were 3
done, and many strange objects cherished. It was whispered that a certain line of 3
elusive priests still harboured the true charm against Ghatanothoa which Imash- 3
Mo stole from the sleeping T'yog; though none remained who could read or 3
understand the cryptic syllables, or who could even guess in what part of the 3
world the lost K'naa, the dreaded peak of Yaddith-Gho, and the titan fortress of 3
the Devil-God had lain. 3
3
Though it flourished chiefly in those Pacific regions around which Mu itself had 3
once stretched, there were rumours of the hidden and detested cult of 3
Ghatanothoa in ill-fated Atlantis, and on the abhorred plateau of Leng. Von Junzt 3
implied its presence in the fabled subterrene kingdom of K'n-yan, and gave clear 3
evidence that it had penetrated Egypt, Chaldaea, Persia, China, the forgotten 3
Semite empires of Africa, and Mexico and Peru in the New World. That it had a 3
strong connexion with the witchcraft movement in Europe, against which the 3
bulls of popes were vainly directed, he more than strongly hinted. The West, 3
however, was never favourable to its growth; and public indignation - aroused 3
by glimpses of hideous rites and nameless sacrifices - wholly stamped out many 3
of its branches. In the end it became a hunted, doubly furtive underground affair 3
- yet never could its nucleus be quite exterminated. It always survived somehow, 3
chiefly in the Far East and on the Pacific Islands, where its teachings became 3
merged into the esoteric lore of the Polynesian Areoi. 3
3
3
3
1030 3
3
3
3
Von Junzt gave subtle and disquieting hints of actual contact with the cult; so 3
that as I read I shuddered at what was rumoured about his death. He spoke of 3
the growth of certain ideas regarding the appearance of the Devil-God - a 3
creature which no human being (unless it were the too-daring T'yog, who had 3
never returned) had ever seen - and contrasted this habit of speculation with the 3
taboo prevailing in ancient Mu against any attempt to imagine what the horror 3
looked like. There was a peculiar tearfulness about the devotees' awed and 3
fascinated whispers on this subject - whispers heavy with morbid curiosity 3
concerning the precise nature of what T'yog might have confronted in that 3
frightful pre-human edifice on the dreaded and now-sunken mountains before 3
the end (if it was an end) finally came - and I felt oddly disturbed by the German 3
scholar's oblique and insidious references to this topic. 3
3
Scarcely less disturbing were von Junzt's conjectures on the whereabouts of the 3
stolen scroll of cantrips against Ghatanothoa, and on the ultimate uses to which 3
this scroll might be put. Despite all my assurance that the whole matter was 3
purely mythical, I could not help shivering at the notion of a latter-day 3
emergence of the monstrous god, and at the picture of an humanity turned 3
suddenly to a race of abnormal statues, each encasing a living brain doomed to 3
inert and helpless consciousness for untold aeons of futurity. The old Dusseldorf 3
savant had a poisonous way of suggesting more than he stated, and I could 3
understand why his damnable book was suppressed in so many countries as 3
blasphemous, dangerous, and unclean. 3
3
I writhed with repulsion, yet the thing exerted an unholy fascination; and I could 3
not lay it down till I had finished it. The alleged reproductions of designs and 3
ideographs from Mu were marvellously and startlingly like the markings on the 3
strange cylinder and the characters on the scroll, and the whole account teemed 3
with details having vague, irritating suggestions of resemblance to things 3
connected with the hideous mummy. The cylinder and scroll - the Pacific setting 3
- the persistent notion of old Capt. Weatherbee that the Cyclopean crypt where 3
the mummy was found had once lain under a vast building . . . somehow I was 3
vaguely glad that the volcanic island had sunk before that massive suggestion of 3
a trapdoor could be opened. 3
3
IV. 3
3
What I read in the Black Book formed a fiendishly apt preparation for the news 3
items and closer events which began to force themselves upon me in the spring 3
of 1932. I can scarcely recall just when the increasingly frequent reports of police 3
action against the odd and fantastical religious cults in the Orient and elsewhere 3
commenced to impress me; but by May or June I realised that there was, all over 3
the world, a surprising and unwonted burst of activity on the part of bizarre. 3
3
3
3
1031 3
3
3
3
furtive, and esoteric mystical organisations ordinarily quiescent and seldom 3
heard from. 3
3
It is not likely that I would have connected these reports with either the hints of 3
von Junzt or the popular furore over the mummy and cylinder in the museum, 3
but for certain significant syllables and persistent resemblances - sensationally 3
dwelt upon by the press - in the rites and speeches of the various secret 3
celebrants brought to public attention. As it was, I could not help remarking with 3
disquiet the frequent recurrence of a name - in various corrupt forms - which 3
seemed to constitute a focal point of all the cult worship, and which was 3
obviously regarded with a singular mixture of reverence and terror. Some of the 3
forms quoted were G'tanta, Tanotah, Than-Tha, Gatan, and Ktan-Tah - and it did 3
not require the suggestions of my now numerous occultist correspondents to 3
make me see in these variants a hideous and suggestive kinship to the monstrous 3
name rendered by von Junzt as Ghatanothoa. 3
3
There were other disquieting features, too. Again and again the reports cited 3
vague, awestruck references to a "true scroll" - something on which tremendous 3
consequences seemed to hinge, and which was mentioned as being in the 3
custody of a certain "Nagob", whoever and whatever he might be. Likewise, 3
there was an insistent repetition of a name which sounded like Tog, Tiok, Yog, 3
Zob, or Yob, and which my more and more excited consciousness involuntarily 3
linked with the name of the hapless heretic T'yog as given in the Black Book. 3
This name was usually uttered in connexion with such cryptical phrases as "It is 3
none other than he", "He had looked upon its face", "He knows all, though he 3
can neither see nor feel", "He has brought the memory down through the aeons", 3
"The true scroll will release him", "Nagob has the true scroll", "He can tell where 3
to find it". 3
3
Something very queer was undoubtedly in the air, and I did not wonder when 3
my occultist correspondents, as well as the sensational Sunday papers, began to 3
connect the new abnormal stirrings with the legends of Mu on the one hand, and 3
with the frightful mummy's recent exploitation on the other hand. The 3
widespread articles in the first wave of press publicity, with their insistent 3
linkage of the mummy, cylinder, and scroll with the tale in the Black Book, and 3
their crazily fantastic speculations about the whole matter, might very well have 3
roused the latent fanaticism in hundreds of those furtive groups of exotic 3
devotees with which our complex world abounds. Nor did the papers cease 3
adding fuel to the flames - for the stories on the cult-stirrings were even wilder 3
than the earlier series of yarns. 3
3
As the summer drew on, attendants noticed a curious new element among the 3
throngs of visitors which - after a lull following the first burst of publicity - were 3
3
3
3
1032 3
3
3
3
again drawn to the museum by the second furore. More and more frequently 3
there were persons of strange and exotic aspect - swarthy Asiatics, long-haired 3
nondescripts, and bearded brown men who seemed unused to European clothes 3
- who would invariably inquire for the hall of mummies and would 3
subsequently be found staring at the hideous Pacific specimen in a veritable 3
ecstasy of fascination. Some quiet, sinister undercurrent in this flood of eccentric 3
foreigners seemed to impress all the guards, and I myself was far from 3
undisturbed. I could not help thinking of the prevailing cult-stirrings among just 3
such exotics as these - and the connexion of those stirrings with myths all too 3
close to the frightful mummy and its cylinder scroll. 3
3
At times I was half tempted to withdraw the mummy from exhibition - 3
especially when an attendant told me that he had several times glimpsed 3
strangers making odd obeisances before it, and had overheard sing- song 3
mutterings which sounded like chants or rituals addressed to it at hours when 3
the visiting throngs were somewhat thinned. One of the guards acquired a queer 3
nervous hallucination about the petrified horror in the lone glass case, alleging 3
that he could see from day to day certain vague, subtle, and infinitely slight 3
changes in the frantic flexion of the bony claws, and in the fear-crazed expression 3
of the leathery face. He could not get rid of the loathsome idea that those 3
horrible, bulging eyes were about to pop suddenly open. 3
3
It was early in September, when the curious crowds had lessened and the hall of 3
mummies was sometimes vacant, that the attempt to get at the mummy by 3
cutting the glass of its case was made. The culprit, a swarthy Polynesian, was 3
spied in time by a guard, and was overpowered before any damage occurred. 3
Upon investigation the fellow turned out to be an Hawaiian notorious for his 3
activity in certain underground religious cults, and having a considerable police 3
record in connexion with abnormal and inhuman rites and sacrifices. Some of the 3
papers found in his room were highly puzzling and disturbing, including many 3
sheets covered with hieroglyphs closely resembling those on the scroll at the 3
museum and in the Black Book of von Junzt; but regarding these things he could 3
not be prevailed upon to speak. 3
3
Scarcely a week after this incident, another attempt to get at the mummy - this 3
time by tampering with the lock of his case - resulted in a second arrest. The 3
offender, a Cingalese, had as long and unsavoury a record of loathsome cult 3
activities as the Hawaiian had possessed, and displayed a kindred unwillingness 3
to talk to the police. What made this case doubly and darkly interesting was that 3
a guard had noticed this man several times before, and had heard him 3
addressing to the mummy a peculiar chant containing unmistakable repetitions 3
of the word "T'yog". As a result of this affair I doubled the guards in the hall of 3
3
3
3
1033 3
3
3
3
mummies, and ordered them never to leave the now notorious specimen out of 3
sight, even for a moment. 3
3
As may well be imagined, the press made much of these two incidents, 3
reviewing its talk of primal and fabulous Mu, and claiming boldly that the 3
hideous mummy was none other than the daring heretic T'yog, petrified by 3
something he had seen in the pre-human citadel he had invaded, and preserved 3
intact through 175,000 years of our planet's turbulent history. That the strange 3
devotees represented cults descended from Mu, and that they were worshipping 3
the mummy - or perhaps even seeking to awaken it to life by spells and 3
incantations - was emphasised and reiterated in the most sensational fashion. 3
3
Writers exploited the insistence of the old legends that the brain of 3
Ghatanothoa's petrified victims remained conscious and unaffected - a point 3
which served as a basis for the wildest and most improbable speculations. The 3
mention of a "true scroll" also received due attention - it being the prevailing 3
popular theory that T'yog's stolen charm against Ghatanothoa was somewhere 3
in existence, and that cult-members were trying to bring it into contact with 3
T'yog himself for some purpose of their own. One result of this exploitation was 3
that a third wave of gaping visitors began flooding the museum and staring at 3
the hellish mummy which served as a nucleus for the whole strange and 3
disturbing affair. 3
3
It was among this wave of spectators - many of whom made repeated visits - that 3
talk of the mummy's vaguely changing aspect first began to be widespread. I 3
suppose - despite the disturbing notion of the nervous guard some months 3
before - that the museum's personnel was too well used to the constant sight of 3
odd shapes to pay close attention to details; in any case, it was the excited 3
whispers of visitors which at length aroused the guards to the subtle mutation 3
which was apparently in progress. Almost simultaneously the press got hold of it 3
- with blatant results which can well be imagined. 3
3
Naturally, I gave the matter my most careful observation, and by the middle of 3
October decided that a definite disintegration of the mummy was under way. 3
Through some chemical or physical influence in the air, the half-stony, half- 3
leathery fibres seemed to be gradually relaxing, causing distinct variations in the 3
angles of the limbs and in certain details of the fear-twisted facial expression. 3
After a half-century of perfect preservation this was a highly disconcerting 3
development, and I had the museum's taxidermist. Dr. Moore, go carefully over 3
the gruesome object several times. He reported a general relaxation and 3
softening, and gave the thing two or three astringent sprayings, but did not dare 3
to attempt anything drastic lest there be a sudden crumbling and accelerated 3
decay. 3
3
3
3
1034 3
3
3
3
The effect of all this upon the gaping crowds was curious. Heretofore each new 3
sensation sprung by the press had brought fresh waves of staring and 3
whispering visitors, but now - though the papers blathered endlessly about the 3
mummy's changes - the public seemed to have acquired a definite sense of fear 3
which outranked even its morbid curiosity. People seemed to feel that a sinister 3
aura hovered over the museum, and from a high peak the attendance fell to a 3
level distinctly below normal. This lessened attendance gave added prominence 3
to the stream of freakish foreigners who continued to infest the place, and whose 3
numbers seemed in no way diminished. 3
3
On November 18th a Peruvian of Indian blood suffered a strange hysterical or 3
epileptic seizure in front of the mummy, afterward shrieking from his hospital 3
cot, "It tried to open its eyes! - T'yog tried to open his eyes and stare at me!" I 3
was by this time on the point of removing the object from exhibition, but 3
permitted myself to be overruled at a meeting of our very conservative directors. 3
However, I could see that the museum was beginning to acquire an unholy 3
reputation in its austere and quiet neighbourhood. After this incident I gave 3
instructions that no one be allowed to pause before the monstrous Pacific relic for 3
more than a few minutes at a time. 3
3
It was on November 24th, after the museum's five o'clock closing, that one of the 3
guards noticed a minute opening of the mummy's eyes. The phenomenon was 3
very slight - nothing but a thin crescent of cornea being visible in either eye - but 3
it was none the less of the highest interest. Dr. Moore, having been summoned 3
hastily, was about to study the exposed bits of eyeball with a magnifier when his 3
handling of the mummy caused the leathery lids to fall tightly shut again. All 3
gentle efforts to open them failed, and the taxidermist did not dare to apply 3
drastic measures. When he notified me of all this by telephone I felt a sense of 3
mounting dread hard to reconcile with the apparently simple event concerned. 3
For a moment I could share the popular impression that some evil, amorphous 3
blight from unplumbed deeps of time and space hung murkily and menacingly 3
over the museum. 3
3
Two nights later a sullen Filipino was trying to secrete himself in the museum at 3
closing time. Arrested and taken to the station, he refused even to give his name, 3
and was detained as a suspicious person. Meanwhile the strict surveillance of the 3
mummy seemed to discourage the odd hordes of foreigners from haunting it. At 3
least, the number of exotic visitors distinctly fell off after the enforcement of the 3
"move along" order. 3
3
It was during the early morning hours of Thursday, December 1st, that a terrible 3
climax developed. At about one o'clock horrible screams of mortal fright and 3
agony were heard issuing from the museum, and a series of frantic telephone 3
3
3
3
1035 3
3
3
3
calls from neighbours brought to the scene quickly and simultaneously a squad 3
of police and several museum officials, including myself. Some of the policemen 3
surrounded the building while others, with the officials, cautiously entered. In 3
the main corridor we found the night watchman strangled to death - a bit of East 3
Indian hemp still knotted around his neck - and realised that despite all 3
precautions some darkly evil intruder or intruders had gained access to the 3
place. Now, however, a tomb- like silence enfolded everything and we almost 3
feared to advance upstairs to the fateful wing where we knew the core of the 3
trouble must lurk. We felt a bit more steadied after flooding the building with 3
light from the central switches in the corridor, and finally crept reluctantly up the 3
curving staircase and through a lofty archway to the hall of mummies. 3
3
V. 3
3
It is from this point onward that reports of the hideous case have been censored - 3
for we have all agreed that no good can be accomplished by a public knowledge 3
of those terrestrial conditions implied by the further developments. I have said 3
that we flooded the whole building with light before our ascent. Now beneath 3
the beams that beat down on the glistening cases and their gruesome contents, 3
we saw outspread a mute horror whose baffling details testified to happenings 3
utterly beyond our comprehension. There were two intruders - who we 3
afterward agreed must have hidden in the building before closing time - but they 3
would never be executed for the watchman's murder. They had already paid the 3
penalty. 3
3
One was a Burmese and the other a Fiji-Islander - both known to the police for 3
their share in frightful and repulsive cult activities. They were dead, and the 3
more we examined them the more utterly monstrous and unnamable we felt 3
their manner of death to be. On both faces was a more wholly frantic and 3
inhuman look of fright than even the oldest policeman had ever seen before; yet 3
in the state of the two bodies there were vast and significant differences. 3
3
The Burmese lay collapsed close to the nameless mummy's case, from which a 3
square of glass had been neatly cut. In his right hand was a scroll of bluish 3
membrane which I at once saw was covered with greyish hieroglyphs - almost a 3
duplicate of the scroll in the strange cylinder in the library downstairs, though 3
later study brought out subtle differences. There was no mark of violence on the 3
body, and in view of the desperate, agonised expression on the twisted face we 3
could only conclude that the man died of sheer fright. 3
3
It was the closely adjacent Fijian, though, that gave us the profoundest shock. 3
One of the policemen was the first to feel of him, and the cry of fright he emitted 3
added another shudder to that neighbourhood's night of terror. We ought to 3
3
3
3
1036 3
3
3
3
have known from the lethal greyness of the once-black, fear-twisted face, and of 3
the bony hands - one of which still clutched an electric torch - that something 3
was hideously wrong; yet every one of us was unprepared for what that officer's 3
hesitant touch disclosed. Even now I can think of it only with a paroxysm of 3
dread and repulsion. To be brief - the hapless invader, who less than an hour 3
before had been a sturdy living Melanesian bent on unknown evils, was now a 3
rigid, ash-grey figure of stony, leathery petrification, in every respect identical 3
with the crouching, aeon-old blasphemy in the violated glass case. 3
3
Yet that was not the worst. Crowning all other horrors, and indeed seizing our 3
shocked attention before we turned to the bodies on the floor, was the state of the 3
frightful mummy. No longer could its changes be called vague and subtle, for it 3
had now made radical shifts of posture. It had sagged and slumped with a 3
curious loss of rigidity; its bony claws had sunk until they no longer even partly 3
covered its leathery, fear- crazed face; and - God help us! - its hellish bulging 3
eyes had popped wide open, and seemed to be staring directly at the two 3
intruders who had died of fright or worse. 3
3
That ghastly, dead-fish stare was hideously mesmerising, and it haunted us all 3
the time we were examining the bodies of the invaders. Its effect on our nerves 3
was damnably queer, for we somehow felt a curious rigidity creeping over us 3
and hampering our simplest motions - a rigidity which later vanished very oddly 3
when we passed the hieroglyphed scroll around for inspection. Every now and 3
then I felt my gaze drawn irresistibly toward those horrible bulging eyes in the 3
case, and when I returned to study them after viewing the bodies I thought I 3
detected something very singular about the glassy surface of the dark and 3
marvellously well-preserved pupils. The more I looked, the more fascinated I 3
became; and at last I went down to the office - despite that strange stiffness in my 3
limbs - and brought up a strong multiple magnifying glass. With this I 3
commenced a very close and careful survey of the fishy pupils, while the others 3
crowded expectantly around. 3
3
I had always been rather sceptical of the theory that scenes and objects become 3
photographed on the retina of the eye in cases of death or coma; yet no sooner 3
did I look through the lens than I realised the presence of some sort of image 3
other than the room's reflection in the glassy, bulging optics of this nameless 3
spawn of the aeons. Certainly, there was a dimly outlined scene on the age-old 3
retinal surface, and I could not doubt that it formed the last thing on which those 3
eyes had looked in life - countless millennia ago. It seemed to be steadily fading, 3
and I fumbled with the magnifier in order to shift another lens into place. Yet it 3
must have been accurate and clear-cut; even if infinitesimally small, when - in 3
response to some evil spell or act connected with their visit - it had confronted 3
those intruders who were frightened to death. With the extra lens I could make 3
3
3
3
1037 3
3
3
3
out many details formerly invisible, and the awed group around me hung on the 3
flood of words with which I tried to tell what I saw. 3
3
For here, in the year 1932, a man in the city of Boston was looking on something 3
which belonged to an unknown and utterly alien world - a world that vanished 3
from existence and normal memory aeons ago. There was a vast room - a 3
chamber of Cyclopean masonry - and I seemed to be viewing it from one of its 3
corners. On the walls were carvings so hideous that even in this imperfect image 3
their stark blasphemousness and bestiality sickened me. I could not believe that 3
the carvers of these things were human, or that they had ever seen human beings 3
when they shaped the frightful outlines which leered at the beholder. In the 3
centre of the chamber was a colossal trap-door of stone, pushed upward to 3
permit the emergence of some object from below. The object should have been 3
clearly visible - indeed, must have been when the eyes first opened before the 3
fear-stricken intruders - though under my lenses it was merely a monstrous blur. 3
3
As it happened, I was studying the right eye only when I brought the extra 3
magnification into play. A moment later I wished fervently that my search had 3
ended there. As it was, however, the zeal of discovery and revelation was upon 3
me, and I shifted my powerful lenses to the mummy's left eye in the hope of 3
finding the image less faded on that retina. My hands, trembling with excitement 3
and unnaturally stiff from some obscure influence, were slow in bringing the 3
magnifier into focus, but a moment later I realised that the image was less faded 3
than in the other eye. I saw in a morbid flash of half-distinctness the insufferable 3
thing which was welling up through the prodigious trap-door in that Cyclopean, 3
immemorially archaic crypt of a lost world - and fell fainting with an inarticulate 3
shriek of which I am not even ashamed. 3
3
By the time I revived there was no distinct image of anything in either eye of the 3
monstrous mummy. Sergeant Keefe of the police looked with my glass, for I 3
could not bring myself to face that abnormal entity again. And I thanked all the 3
powers of the cosmos that I had not looked earlier than I did. It took all my 3
resolution, and a great deal of solicitation, to make me relate what I had 3
glimpsed in the hideous moment of revelation. Indeed, I could not speak till we 3
had all adjourned to the office below, out of sight of that daemoniac thing which 3
could not be. For I had begun to harbour the most terrible and fantastic notions 3
about the mummy and its glassy, bulging eyes - that it had a kind of hellish 3
consciousness, seeing all that occurred before it and trying vainly to 3
communicate some frightful message from the gulfs of time. That meant 3
madness - but at last I thought I might be better off if I told what I had half seen. 3
3
After all, it was not a long thing to tell. Oozing and surging up out of that 3
yawning trap-door in the Cyclopean crypt I had glimpsed such an unbelievable 3

behemothic monstrosity that I could not doubt the power of its original to kill 3
with its mere sight. Even now I cannot begin to suggest it with any words at my 3
command. I might call it gigantic - tentacled - proboscidian - octopus-eyed - 3
semi-amorphous - plastic - partly squamous and partly rugose - ugh! But nothing 3
I could say could even adumbrate the loathsome, unholy, non-human, extra- 3
galactic horror and hatefulness and unutterable evil of that forbidden spawn of 3
black chaos and illimitable night. As I write these words the associated mental 3
image causes me to lean back faint and nauseated. As I told of the sight to the 3
men around me in the office, I had to fight to preserve the consciousness I had 3
regained. 3
3
Nor were my hearers much less moved. Not a man spoke above a whisper for a 3
full quarter-hour, and there were awed, half-furtive references to the frightful 3
lore in the Black Book, to the recent newspaper tales of cult-stirrings, and to the 3
sinister events in the museum. Ghatanothoa . . . Even its smallest perfect image 3
could petrify - T'yog - the false scroll - he never came back - the true scroll which 3
could fully or partly undo the petrification - did it survive? - the hellish cults - 3
the phrases overheard - "It is none other than he" - "He had looked upon its 3
face" - "He knows all, though he can neither see nor feel" - "He had brought the 3
memory down through the aeons" - "The true scroll will release him" - "Nagob 3
has the true scroll" - "He can tell where to find it." Only the healing greyness of 3
the dawn brought us back to sanity; a sanity which made of that glimpse of mine 3
a closed topic - something not to be explained or thought of again. 3
3
We gave out only partial reports to the press, and later on cooperated with the 3
papers in making other suppressions. For example, when the autopsy shewed 3
the brain and several other internal organs of the petrified Fijian to be fresh and 3
unpetrified, though hermetically sealed by the petrification of the exterior flesh - 3
an anomaly about which physicians are still guardedly and bewilderedly 3
debating - we did not wish a furore to be started. We knew too well what the 3
yellow journals, remembering what was said of the intact-brained and still- 3
conscious state of Ghatanothoa's stony-leathery victims, would make of this 3
detail. 3
3
As matters stood, they pointed out that the man who had held the hieroglyphed 3
scroll - and who had evidently thrust it at the mummy through the opening in 3
the case - was not petrified, while the man who had not held it was. When they 3
demanded that we make certain experiments - applying the scroll both to the 3
stony-leathery body of the Fijian and to the mummy itself - we indignantly 3
refused to abet such superstitious notions. Of course, the mummy was 3
withdrawn from public view and transferred to the museum laboratory awaiting 3
a really scientific examination before some suitable medical authority. 3
Remembering past events, we kept it under a strict guard; but even so, an 3
3
3
3

3
3
3
attempt was made to enter the museum at 2:25 a.m. on December 5th. Prompt 3
working of the burglar alarm frustrated the design, though unfortunately the 3
criminal or criminals escaped. 3
3
That no hint of anything further ever reached the public, I am profoundly 3
thankful. I wish devoutly that there were nothing more to tell. There will, of 3
course, be leaks, and if anything happens to me I do not know what my 3
executors will do with this manuscript; but at least the case will not be painfully 3
fresh in the multitude's memory when the revelation comes. Besides, no one will 3
believe the facts when they are finally told. That is the curious thing about the 3
multitude. When their yellow press makes hints, they are ready to swallow 3
anything; but when a stupendous and abnormal revelation is actually made, they 3
laugh it aside as a lie. For the sake of general sanity it is probably better so. 3
3
I have said that a scientific examination of the frightful mummy was planned. 3
This took place on December 8th, exactly a week after the hideous culmination of 3
events, and was conducted by the eminent Dr. William Minot, in conjunction 3
with Wentworth Moore, Sc.D., taxidermist of the museum. Dr. Minot had 3
witnessed the autopsy of the oddly petrified Fijian the week before. There were 3
also present Messrs. Lawrence Cabot and Dudley Saltonstall of the museum's 3
trustees, Drs. Mason, Wells, and Carver of the museum staff, two representatives 3
of the press, and myself. During the week the condition of the hideous specimen 3
had not visibly changed, though some relaxation of its fibres caused the position 3
of the glassy, open eyes to shift slightly from time to time. All of the staff 3
dreaded to look at the thing - for its suggestion of quiet, conscious watching had 3
become intolerable - and it was only with an effort that I could bring myself to 3
attend the examination. 3
3
Dr. Minot arrived shortly after 1:00 p.m., and within a few minutes began his 3
survey of the mummy. Considerable disintegration took place under his hands, 3
and in view of this - and of what we told him concerning the gradual relaxation 3
of the specimen since the first of October - he decided that a thorough dissection 3
ought to be made before the substance was further impaired. The proper 3
instruments being present in the laboratory equipment, he began at once; 3
exclaiming aloud at the odd, fibrous nature of the grey, mummified substance. 3
3
But his exclamation was still louder when he made the first deep incision, for out 3
of that cut there slowly trickled a thick crimson stream whose nature - despite 3
the infinite ages dividing this hellish mummy's lifetime from the present - was 3
utterly unmistakable. A few more deft strokes revealed various organs in 3
astonishing degrees of non-petrified preservation - all, indeed, being intact 3
except where injuries to the petrified exterior had brought about malformation or 3
destruction. The resemblance of this condition to that found in the fright-killed 3
3
3

3
3
3
Fiji-Islander was so strong that the eminent physician gasped in bewilderment. 3
The perfection of those ghastly bulging eyes was uncanny, and their exact state 3
with respect to petrification was very difficult to determine. 3
3
At 3:30 p.m. the brain-case was opened - and ten minutes later our stunned 3
group took an oath of secrecy which only such guarded documents as this 3
manuscript will ever modify. Even the two reporters were glad to confirm the 3
silence. For the opening had revealed a pulsing, living brain. 3

A damp gloomy evening in April it was, just after the close of the Great War, 3
when Marcia found herself alone with strange thoughts and wishes, unheard-of 3
yearnings which floated out of the spacious twentieth- century drawing room, 3
up the deeps of the air, and eastward to olive groves in distant Arcady which she 3
had seen only in her dreams. She had entered the room in abstraction, turned off 3
the glaring chandeliers, and now reclined on a soft divan by a solitary lamp 3
which shed over the reading table a green glow as soothing as moonlight when it 3
issued through the foliage about an antique shrine. 3
3
Attired simply, in a low-cut black evening dress, she appeared outwardly a 3
typical product of modern civilization; but tonight she felt the immeasurable gulf 3
that separated her soul from all her prosaic surroundings. Was it because of the 3
strange home in which she lived, that abode of coldness where relations were 3
always strained and the inmates scarcely more than strangers? Was it that, or 3
was it some greater and less explicable misplacement in time and space, whereby 3
she had been born too late, too early, or too far away from the haunts of her spirit 3
ever to harmonize with the unbeautiful things of contemporary reality? To dispel 3
the mood which was engulfing her more and more deeply each moment, she 3
took a magazine from the table and searched for some healing bit of poetry. 3
Poetry had always relieved her troubled mind better than anything else, though 3
many things in the poetry she had seen detracted from the influence. Over parts 3
of even the sublimest verses hung a chill vapor of sterile ugliness and restraint, 3
like dust on a window-pane through which one views a magnificent sunset. 3
3
Listlessly turning the magazine's pages, as if searching for an elusive treasure, 3
she suddenly came upon something which dispelled her languor. An observer 3
could have read her thoughts and told that she had discovered some image or 3
dream which brought her nearer to her unattained goal than any image or dream 3
she had seen before. It was only a bit of vers libre, that pitiful compromise of the 3
poet who overleaps prose yet falls short of the divine melody of numbers; but it 3
had in it all the unstudied music of a bard who lives and feels, who gropes 3
ecstatically for unveiled beauty. Devoid of regularity, it yet had the harmony of 3
winged, spontaneous words, a harmony missing from the formal, convention- 3
bound verse she had known. As she read on, her surroundings gradually faded. 3
3
3
3

3

3
and soon there lay about her only the mists of dream, the purple, star-strewn 3
mists beyond time, where only Gods and dreamers walk. 3

Amid the mists of dream the reader cried to the rhythmical stars, of her delight at 3

Out of the mists gleamed godlike the torm ot a youth, in winged helmet and 3
sandals, caduceus-bearing, and of a beauty like to nothing on earth. Before the 3
face of the sleeper he thrice waved the rod which Apollo had given him in trade 3
for the nine-corded shell of melody, and upon her brow he placed a wreath of 3
myrtle and roses. Then, adoring, Hermes spoke: 3
3
"0 Nymph more fair than the golden-haired sisters of Cyene or the sky- 3
inhabiting Atlantides, beloved of Aphrodite and blessed of Pallas, thou hast 3
indeed discovered the secret of the Gods, which lieth in beauty and song. 3
Prophetess more lovely than the Sybil of Cumae when Apollo first knew her, 3
thou has truly spoken of the new age, for even now on Maenalus, Pan sighs and 3
stretches in his sleep, wishful to wake and behold about him the little rose- 3
crowned fauns and the antique Satyrs. In thy yearning hast thou divined what no 3
mortal, saving only a few whom the world rejects, remembereth: that the Gods 3
were never dead, but only sleeping the sleep and dreaming the dreams of Gods 3
in lotos-filled Hesperian gardens beyond the golden sunset. And now draweth 3
nigh the time of their awakening, when coldness and ugliness shall perish, and 3
Zeus sit once more on Olympus. Already the sea about Paphos trembleth into a 3
foam which only ancient skies have looked on before, and at night on Helicon 3
the shepherds hear strange murmurings and half-remembered notes. Woods and 3
fields are tremulous at twilight with the shimmering of white saltant forms, and 3
immemorial Ocean yields up curious sights beneath thin moons. The Gods are 3
patient, and have slept long, but neither man nor giant shall defy the Gods 3
forever. In Tartarus the Titans writhe and beneath the fiery Aetna groan the 3
children of Uranus and Gaea. The day now dawns when man must answer for 3
centuries of denial, but in sleeping the Gods have grown kind and will not hurl 3
him to the gulf made for denier s of Gods. Instead will their vengeance smite the 3
darkness, fallacy and ugliness which have turned the mind of man; and under 3
the sway of bearded Saturnus shall mortals, once more sacrificing unto him, 3
dwell in beauty and delight. This night shalt thou know the favour of the Gods, 3
and behold on Parnassus those dreams which the Gods have through ages sent 3
to earth to show that they are not dead. For poets are the dreams of Gods, and in 3
each and every age someone hath sung unknowingly the message and the 3
promise from the lotosgardens beyond the sunset." 3
3
Then in his arms Hermes bore the dreaming maiden through the skies. Gentle 3
breezes from the tower of Aiolas wafted them high above warm, scented seas, till 3
suddenly they came upon Zeus, holding court upon double-headed Parnassus, 3
his golden throne flanked by Apollo and the Muses on the right hand, and by 3
ivy-wreathed Dionysus and pleasure-flushed Bacchae on the left hand. So much 3
of splendour Marcia had never seen before, either awake or in dreams, but its 3
radiance did her no injury, as would have the radiance of lofty Olympus; for in 3
this lesser court the Father of Gods had tempered his glories for the sight of 3
3
3
3
1044 3
3
3
3
mortals. Before the laurel-draped mouth of the Corycian cave sat in a row six 3
noble forms with the aspect of mortals, but the countenances of Gods. These the 3
dreamer recognized from images of them which she had beheld, and she knew 3
that they were none else than the divine Maeonides, the avernian Dante, the 3
more than mortal Shakespeare, the chaos-exploring Milton, the cosmic Goethe 3
and the musalan Keats. These were those messengers whom the Gods had sent 3
to tell men that Pan had passed not away, but only slept; for it is in poetry that 3
Gods speak to men. Then spake the Thunderer: 3
3
"0 Daughter-for, being one of my endless line, thou art indeed my daughter- 3
behold upon ivory thrones of honour the august messengers Gods have sent 3
down that in the words and writing of men there may be still some traces of 3
divine beauty. Other bards have men justly crowned with enduring laurels, but 3
these hath Apollo crowned, and these have I set in places apart, as mortals who 3
have spoken the language of the Gods. Long have we dreamed in lotosgardens 3
beyond the West, and spoken only through our dreams; but the time approaches 3
when our voices shall not be silent. It is a time of awakening and change. Once 3
more hath Phaeton ridden low, searing the fields and drying the streams. In Gaul 3
lone nymphs with disordered hair weep beside fountains that are no more, and 3
pine over rivers turned red with the blood of mortals. Ares and his train have 3
gone forth with the madness of Gods and have returned Deimos and Phobos 3
glutted with unnatural delight. Tellus moons with grief, and the faces of men are 3
as the faces of Erinyes, even as when Astraea fled to the skies, and the waves of 3
our bidding encompassed all the land saving this high peak alone. Amidst this 3
chaos, prepared to herald his coming yet to conceal his arrival, even now toileth 3
our latest born messenger, in whose dreams are all the images which other 3
messengers have dreamed before him. He it is that we have chosen to blend into 3
one glorious whole all the beauty that the world hath known before, and to write 3
words wherein shall echo all the wisdom and the loveliness of the past. He it is 3
who shall proclaim our return and sing of the days to come when Fauns and 3
Dryads shall haunt their accustomed groves in beauty. Guided was our choice by 3
those who now sit before the Corycian grotto on thrones of ivory, and in whose 3
songs thou shalt hear notes of sublimity by which years hence thou shalt know 3
the greater messenger when he cometh. Attend their voices as one by one they 3
sing to thee here. Each note shall thou hear again in the poetry which is to come, 3
the poetry which shall bring peace and pleasure to thy soul, though search for it 3
through bleak years thou must. Attend with diligence, for each chord that 3
vibrates away into hiding shall appear again to thee after thou hast returned to 3
earth, as Alpheus, sinking his waters into the soul of Hellas, appears as the 3
crystal arethusa in remote Sicilia." 3
3
Then arose Homeros, the ancient among bards, who took his lyre and chanted 3
his hymn to Aphrodite. No word of Greek did Marcia know, yet did the message 3
3
3
3
1045 3
3
3
3
not fall vainly upon her ears, for in the cryptic rhythm was that which spake to 3
all mortals and Gods, and needed no interpreter. 3
3
So too the songs of Dante and Goethe, whose unknown words dave the ether 3
with melodies easy to ready and adore. But at last remembered accents 3
resounded before the listener. It was the Swan of Avon, once a God among men, 3
and still a God among Gods: 3
3
3
3
Write, write, that from the 3
My dearest master, your 3
3
Bless him at home in peace 3
His name with zealous fervour sanctify. 3

"Beauty is truth — truth beauty" — that is all 3
Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know. 3
3
As the singer ceased, there came a sound in the wind blowing from far Egypt, 3
where at night Aurora mourns by the Nile for her slain Memnon. To the feet of 3
the Thunderer flew the rosy-fingered Goddess and, kneeling, cried, "Master, it is 3
time I unlocked the Gates of the East." And Phoebus, handing his lyre to 3
Calliope, his bride among the Muses, prepared to depart for the jewelled and 3
column-raised Palace of the Sun, where fretted the steeds already harnessed to 3
the golden car of Day. So Zeus descended from his caryen throne and placed his 3
hand upon the head of Marcia, saying: 3
3
"Daughter, the dawn is nigh, and it is well that thou shouldst return before the 3
awakening of mortals to thy home. Weep not at the bleakness of thy life, for the 3
shadow of false faiths will soon be gone and the Gods shall once more walk 3
among men. Search thou unceasingly for our messenger, for in him wilt thou 3
find peace and comfort. By his word shall thy steps be guided to happiness, and 3
in his dreams of beauty shall thy spirit find that which it craveth." As Zeus 3
ceased, the young Hermes gently seized the maiden and bore her up toward the 3
fading stars, up and westward over unseen seas. 3
3
3
3
Many years have passed since Marcia dreamt of the Gods and of their Parnassus 3
conclave. Tonight she sits in the same spacious drawing-room, but she is not 3
alone. Gone is the old spirit of unrest, for beside her is one whose name is 3
luminous with celebrity: the young poet of poets at whose feet sits all the world. 3
He is reading from a manuscript words which none has ever heard before, but 3
which when heard will bring to men the dreams and the fancies they lost so 3
many centuries ago, when Pan lay down to doze in Arcady, and the great Gods 3
withdrew to sleep in lotos-gardens beyond the lands of the Hesperides. In the 3
subtle cadences and hidden melodies of the bard the spirit of the maiden had 3
found rest at last, for there echo the divinest notes of Thracian Orpheus, notes 3
that moved the very rocks and trees by Hebrus' banks. The singer ceases, and 3
with eagerness asks a verdict, yet what can Marcia say but that the strain is "fit 3
for the Gods"? 3
3
And as she speaks there comes again a vision of Parnassus and the far-off sound 3
of a mighty voice saying, "By his word shall thy steps be guided to happiness, 3
and in his dreams of beauty shall thy spirit find all that it craveth." 3

Of the pleasures and pains of opium much has been written. The ecstasies and 3
horrors of De Quincey and the paradis artificiels of Baudelaire are preserved and 3
interpreted with an art which makes them immortal, and the world knows well 3
the beauty, the terror and the mystery of those obscure realms into which the 3
inspired dreamer is transported. But much as has been told, no man has yet 3
dared intimate the nature of the phantasms thus unfolded to the mind, or hint at 3
the direction of the unheard-of roads along whose ornate and exotic course the 3
partaker of the drug is so irresistibly borne. De Quincey was drawn back into 3
Asia, that teeming land of nebulous shadows whose hideous antiquity is so 3
impressive that "the vast age of the race and name overpowers the sense of 3
youth in the individual," but farther than that he dared not go. Those who have 3
gone farther seldom returned, and even when they have, they have been either 3
silent or quite mad. I took opium but once — in the year of the plague, when 3
doctors sought to deaden the agonies they could not cure. There was an overdose 3
— my physician was worn out with horror and exertion — and I travelled very 3
far indeed. In the end I returned and lived, but my nights are filled with strange 3
memories, nor have I ever permitted a doctor to give me opium again. 3
3
The pain and pounding in my head had been quite unendurable when the drug 3
was administered. Of the future I had no heed; to escape, whether by cure, 3
unconsciousness, or death, was all that concerned me. I was partly delirious, so 3
that it is hard to place the exact moment of transition, but I think the effect must 3
have begun shortly before the pounding ceased to be painful. As I have said, 3
there was an overdose; so my reactions were probably far from normal. The 3
sensation of falling, curiously dissociated from the idea of gravity or direction, 3
was paramount; though there was subsidiary impression of unseen throngs in 3
incalculable profusion, throngs of infinitely di-verse nature, but all more or less 3
related to me. Sometimes it seemed less as though I were falling, than as though 3
the universe or the ages were falling past me. Suddenly my pain ceased, and I 3
began to associate the pounding with an external rather than internal force. The 3
falling had ceased also, giving place to a sensation of uneasy, temporary rest; and 3
when I listened closely, I fancied the pounding was that of the vast, inscrutable 3
sea as its sinister, colossal breakers lacerated some desolate shore after a storm of 3
titanic magnitude. Then I opened my eyes. 3

For a moment my surroundings seemed confused, like a projected image 3
hopelessly out of focus, but gradually I realised my solitary presence in a strange 3
and beautiful room lighted by many windows. Of the exact nature of the 3
apartment I could form no idea, for my thoughts were still far from settled, but I 3
noticed van-coloured rugs and draperies, elaborately fashioned tables, chairs, 3
ottomans, and divans, and delicate vases and ornaments which conveyed a 3
suggestion of the exotic without being actually alien. These things I noticed, yet 3
they were not long uppermost in my mind. Slowly but inexorably crawling upon 3
my consciousness and rising above every other impression, came a dizzying fear 3
of the unknown; a fear all the greater because I could not analyse it, and seeming 3
to concern a stealthily approaching menace; not death, but some nameless, 3
unheard-of thing inexpressibly more ghastly and abhorrent. 3
3
Presently I realised that the direct symbol and excitant of my fear was the 3
hideous pounding whose incessant reverberations throbbed maddeningly 3
against my exhausted brain. It seemed to come from a point outside and below 3
the edifice in which I stood, and to associate itself with the most terrifying mental 3
images. I felt that some horrible scene or object lurked beyond the silk-hung 3
walls, and shrank from glancing through the arched, latticed windows that 3
opened so bewilderingly on every hand. Perceiving shutters attached to these 3
windows, I closed them all, averting my eyes from the exterior as I did so. Then, 3
employing a flint and steel which I found on one of the small tables, I lit the 3
many candles reposing about the walls in arabesque sconces. The added sense of 3
security brought by closed shutters and artificial light calmed my nerves to some 3
degree, but I could not shut out the monotonous pounding. Now that I was 3
calmer, the sound became as fascinating as it was fearful, and I felt a 3
contradictory desire to seek out its source despite my still powerful shrinking. 3
Opening a portiere at the side of the room nearest the pounding, I beheld a small 3
and richly draped corridor ending in a cavern door and large oriel window. To 3
this window I was irresistibly drawn, though my ill-defined apprehensions 3
seemed almost equally bent on holding me back. As I approached it I could see a 3
chaotic whirl of waters in the distance. Then, as I attained it and glanced out on 3
all sides, the stupendous picture of my surroundings burst upon me with full 3
and devastating force. 3
3
I beheld such a sight as I had never beheld before, and which no living person 3
can have seen save in the delirium of fever or the inferno of opium. The building 3
stood on a narrow point of land — or what was now a narrow point of land — 3
fully three hundred feet above what must lately have been a seething vortex of 3
mad waters. On either side of the house there fell a newly washed-out precipice 3
of red earth, whilst ahead of me the hideous waves were still rolling in 3
frightfully, eating away the land with ghastly monotony and deliberation. Out a 3
mile or more there rose and fell menacing breakers at least fifty feet in height. 3
3
3
3

3
3
3
and on the far horizon ghouhsh black clouds of grotesque contour were resting 3
and brooding like unwholesome vultures. The waves were dark and purplish, 3
almost black, and clutched at the yielding red mud of the bank as if with 3
uncouth, greedy hands. I could not but feel that some noxious marine mind had 3
declared a war of extermination upon all the solid ground, perhaps abetted by 3
the angry sky. 3
3
Recovering at length from the stupor into which this unnatural spectacle had 3
thrown me, I realized that my actual physical danger was acute. Even whilst I 3
gazed, the bank had lost many feet, and it could not be long before the house 3
would fall undermined into the awful pit of lashing waves. Accordingly I 3
hastened to the opposite side of the edifice, and finding a door, emerged at once, 3
locking it after me with a curious key which had hung inside. I now beheld more 3
of the strange region about me, and marked a singular division which seemed to 3
exist in the hostile ocean and firmament. On each side of the jutting promontory 3
different conditions held sway. At my left as I faced inland was a gently heaving 3
sea with great green waves rolling peacefully in under a brightly shining sun. 3
Something about that sun's nature and position made me shudder, but I could 3
not then tell, and cannot tell now, what it was. At my right also was the sea, but 3
it was blue, calm, and only gently undulating, while the sky above it was darker 3
and the washed-out bank more nearly white than reddish. 3
3
I now turned my attention to the land, and found occasion for fresh surprise; for 3
the vegetation resembled nothing I had ever seen or read about. It was 3
apparently tropical or at least sub-tropical — a conclusion borne out by the 3
intense heat of the air. Sometimes I thought I could trace strange analogies with 3
the flora of my native land, fancying that the well-known plants and shrubs 3
might assume such forms under a radical change of climate; but the gigantic and 3
omnipresent palm trees were plainly foreign. The house I had just left was very 3
small — hardly more than a cottage — but its material was evidently marble, and 3
its architecture was weird and composite, involving a quaint fusion of Western 3
and Eastern forms. At the corners were Corinthian columns, but the red tile roof 3
was like that of a Chinese pagoda. From the door inland there stretched a path of 3
singularly white sand, about four feet wide, and lined on either side with stately 3
palms and unidentifiable flowering shrubs and plants. It lay toward the side of 3
the promontory where the sea was blue and the bank rather whitish. Down this 3
path I felt impelled to flee, as if pursued by some malignant spirit from the 3
pounding ocean. At first it was slightly uphill, then I reached a gentle crest. 3
Behind me I saw the scene I had left; the entire point with the cottage and the 3
black water, with the green sea on one side and the blue sea on the other, and a 3
curse unnamed and unnamable lowering over all. I never saw it again, and often 3
wonder.... After this last look I strode ahead and surveyed the inland panorama 3
before me. 3
3
3
3
1050 3
3
3
3
The path, as I have intimated, ran along the right-hand shore as one went inland. 3
Ahead and to the left I now viewed a magnificent valley comprising thousands 3
of acres, and covered with a swaying growth of tropical grass higher than my 3
head. Almost at the limit of vision was a colossal palm tree which seemed to 3
fascinate and beckon me. By this time wonder and' escape from the imperilled 3
peninsula had largely dissipated my fear, but as I paused and sank fatigued to 3
the path, idiy digging with my hands into the warm, whitish-golden sand, a new 3
and acute sense of danger seized me. Some terror in the swishing tall grass 3
seemed added to that of the diabolically pounding sea, and I started up crying 3
aloud and disjointedly, "Tiger? Tiger? Is it Tiger? Beast? Beast? Is it a Beast that I 3
am afraid of?" My mind wandered back to an ancient and classical story of tigers 3
which I had read; I strove to recall the author, but had difficulty. Then in the 3
midst of my fear I remembered that the tale was by Rudyard Kipling; nor did the 3
grotesqueness of deeming him an ancient author occur to me; I wished for the 3
volume containing this story, and had almost started back toward the doomed 3
cottage to procure it when my better sense and the lure of the palm prevented 3
me. 3
3
Whether or not I could have resisted the backward beckoning without the 3
counter-fascination of the vast palm tree, I do not know. This attraction was now 3
dominant, and I left the path and crawled on hands and knees down the valley's 3
slope despite my fear of the grass and of the serpents it might contain. I resolved 3
to fight for life and reason as long as possible against all menaces of sea or land, 3
though I sometimes feared defeat as the maddening swish of the uncanny 3
grasses joined the still audible and irritating pounding of the distant breakers. I 3
would frequently pause and put my hands to my ears for relief, but could never 3
quite shut out the detestable sound. It was, as it seemed to me, only after ages 3
that I finally dragged myself to the beckoning palm tree and lay quiet beneath its 3
protecting shade. 3
3
There now ensued a series of incidents which transported me to the opposite 3
extremes of ecstasy and horror; incidents which I tremble to recall and dare not 3
seek to interpret. No sooner had I crawled beneath the overhanging foliage of the 3
palm, than there dropped from its branches a young child of such beauty as I 3
never beheld before. Though ragged and dusty, this being bore the features of a 3
faun or demigod, and seemed almost to diffuse a radiance in the dense shadow 3
of the tree. It smiled and extended its hand, but before I could arise and speak I 3
heard in the upper air the exquisite melody of singing; notes high and low blent 3
with a sublime and ethereal harmoniousness. The sun had by this time sunk 3
below the horizon, and in the twilight I saw an aureole of lambent light encircled 3
the child's head. Then in a tone of silver it addressed me: "It is the end. They 3
have come down through the gloaming from the stars. Now all is over, and 3
beyond the Arinurian streams we shall dwell blissfully in Teloe." As the child 3
3
3
3
1051 3
3
3
3
spoke, I beheld a soft radiance through the leaves of the palm tree, and rising, 3
greeted a pair whom I knew to be the chief singers among those I had heard. A 3
god and goddess they must have been, for such beauty is not mortal; and they 3
took my hands, saying, "Come, child, you have heard the voices, and all is well. 3
In Teloe beyond the Milky Way and the Arinurian streams are cities all of amber 3
and chalcedony. And upon their domes of many facets glisten the images of 3
strange and beautiful stars. Under the ivory bridges of Teloe flow rivers of liquid 3
gold bearing pleasure-barges bound for blossomy Cytharion of the Seven Suns. 3
And in Teloe and Cytharion abide only youth, beauty, and pleasure, nor are any 3
sounds heard, save of laughter, song, and the lute. Only the gods dwell in Teloe 3
of the golden rivers, but among them shalt thou dwell." 3
3
As I listened, enchanted, I suddenly became aware of a change in my 3
surroundings. The palm tree, so lately overshadowing my exhausted form, was 3
now some distance to my left and considerably below me. I was obviously 3
floating in the atmosphere; companioned not only by the strange child and the 3
radiant pair, but by a constantly increasing throng of half-luminous, vine- 3
crowned youths and maidens with wind- blown hair and joyful countenance. We 3
slowly ascended together, as if borne on a fragrant breeze which blew not from 3
the earth but from the golden nebulae, and the child whispered in my ear that I 3
must look always upward to the pathways of light, and never backward to the 3
sphere I had just left. The youths and maidens now chanted mellifluous 3
choriambics to the accompaniment of lutes, and I felt enveloped in a peace and 3
happiness more profound than any I had in life imagined, when the intrusion of 3
a single sound altered my destiny and shattered my soul. Through the ravishing 3
strains of the singers and the lutanists, as if in mocking, daemoniac concord, 3
throbbed from gulfs below the damnable, the detestable pounding of that 3
hideous ocean. As those black breakers beat their message into my ears I forgot 3
the words of the child and looked back, down upon the doomed scene from 3
which I thought I had escaped. 3
3
Down through the aether I saw the accursed earth slowly turning, ever turning, 3
with angry and tempestuous seas gnawing at wild desolate shores and dashing 3
foam against the tottering towers of deserted cities. And under a ghastly moon 3
there gleamed sights I can never describe, sights I can never forget; deserts of 3
corpselike clay and jungles of ruin and decadence where once stretched the 3
populous plains and villages of my native land, and maelstroms of frothing 3
ocean where once rose the mighty temples of my forefathers. Mound the 3
northern pole steamed a morass of noisome growths and miasmal vapours, 3
hissing before the onslaught of the ever-mounting waves that curled and fretted 3
from the shuddering deep. Then a rending report dave the night, and athwart 3
the desert of deserts appeared a smoking rift. Still the black ocean foamed and 3
3
3
3
1052 3
3
3
3
gnawed, eating away the desert on either side as the rift in the center widened 3
and widened. 3
3
There was now no land left but the desert, and still the fuming ocean ate and ate. 3
All at once I thought even the pounding sea seemed afraid of something, afraid 3
of dark gods of the inner earth that are greater than the evil god of waters, but 3
even if it was it could not turn back; and the desert had suffered too much from 3
those nightmare waves to help them now. So the ocean ate the last of the land 3
and poured into the smoking gulf, thereby giving up all it had ever conquered. 3
From the new-flooded lands it flowed again, uncovering death and decay; and 3
from its ancient and immemorial bed it trickled loathsomely, uncovering nighted 3
secrets of the years when Time was young and the gods unborn. Above the 3
waves rose weedy remembered spires. The moon laid pale lilies of light on dead 3
London, and Paris stood up from its damp grave to be sanctified with star-dust. 3
Then rose spires and monoliths that were weedy but not remembered; terrible 3
spires and monoliths of lands that men never knew were lands. 3
3
There was not any pounding now, but only the unearthly roaring and hissing of 3
waters tumbling into the rift. The smoke of that rift had changed to steam, and 3
almost hid the world as it grew denser and denser. It seared my face and hands, 3
and when I looked to see how it affected my companions I found they had all 3
disappeared. Then very suddenly it ended, and I knew no more till I awaked 3
upon a bed of convalescence. As the cloud of steam from the Plutonic gulf finally 3
concealed the entire surface from my sight, all the firmament shrieked at a 3
sudden agony of mad reverberations which shook the trembling aether. In one 3
delirious flash and burst it happened; one blinding, deafening holocaust of fire, 3
smoke, and thunder that dissolved the wan moon as it sped outward to the void. 3
3
And when the smoke cleared away, and I sought to look upon the earth, I beheld 3
against the background of cold, humorous stars only the dying sun and the pale 3
mournful planets searching for their sister. 3

3
I awoke abruptly from a horrible dream and stared wildly about. Then, seeing 3
the high, arched ceiling and the narrow stained windows of my friend's room, a 3
flood of uneasy revelation coursed over me; and I knew that all of Andrews' 3
hopes had been realized. I lay supine in a large bed, the posts of which reared 3
upward in dizzy perspective; while on vast shelves about the chamber were the 3
familiar books and antiques I was accustomed to seeing in that secluded corner 3
of the crumbling and ancient mansion which had formed our joint home for 3
many years. On a table by the wall stood a huge candelabrum of early 3
workmanship and design, and the usual light window-curtains had been 3
replaced by hangings of somber black, which took on a faint, ghostly luster in the 3
dying light. 3
3
I recalled forcibly the events preceding my confinement and seclusion in this 3
veritable medieval fortress. They were not pleasant, and I shuddered anew when 3
I remembered the couch that had held me before my tenancy of the present one - 3
the couch that everyone supposed would be my last. Memory burned afresh 3
regarding those hideous circumstances which had compelled me to choose 3
between a true death and a hypothetical one - with a later re-animation by 3
therapeutic methods known only to my comrade, Marshall Andrews. The whole 3
thing had begun when I returned from the Orient a year before and discovered, 3
to my utter horror, that I had contracted leprosy while abroad. I had known that 3
I was taking grave chances in caring for my stricken brother in the Philippines, 3
but no hint of my own affliction appeared until I returned to my native land. 3
Andrews himself had made the discovery, and kept it from me as long as 3
possible; but our close acquaintance soon disclosed the awful truth. 3
3
At once I was quartered in our ancient abode atop the crags overlooking 3
crumbling Hampden, from whose musty halls and quaint, arched doorways I 3
was never permitted to go forth. It was a terrible existence, with the yellow 3
shadow hanging constantly over me; yet my friend never faltered in his faith, 3
taking care not to contract the dread scourge, but meanwhile making life as 3
pleasant and comfortable as possible. His widespread though somewhat sinister 3
fame as a surgeon prevented any authority from discovering my plight and 3
shipping me away. 3
3
3
3
1054 3
3
3
3
It was after nearly a year of this seclusion - late in August - that Andrews 3
decided on a trip to the West Indies - to study "native" medical methods, he said. 3
I was left in care of venerable Simes, the household factotum. So far no outward 3
signs of the disease had developed, and I enjoyed a tolerable though almost 3
completely private existence during my colleague's absence. It was during this 3
time that I read many of the tomes Andrews had acquired in the course of his 3
twenty years as a surgeon, and learned why his reputation, though locally of the 3
highest, was just a bit shady. For the volumes included any number of fanciful 3
subjects hardly related to modern medical knowledge: treatises and 3
unauthoritative articles on monstrous experiments in surgery; accounts of the 3
bizarre effects of glandular transplantation and rejuvenation in animals and men 3
alike; brochures on attempted brain transference, and a host of other fanatical 3
speculations not countenanced by orthodox physicians. It appeared, too, that 3
Andrews was an authority on obscure medicaments; some of the few books I 3
waded through revealing that he had spent much time in chemistry and in the 3
search for new drugs which might be used as aids in surgery. Looking back at 3
those studies now, I find them hellishly suggestive when associated with his later 3
experiments. 3
3
Andrews was gone longer than I expected, returning early in November, almost 3
four months later; and when he did arrive, I was quite anxious to see him, since 3
my condition was at last on the brink of becoming noticeable. I had reached a 3
point where I must seek absolute privacy to keep from being discovered. But my 3
anxiety was slight as compared with his exuberance over a certain new plan he 3
had hatched while in the Indies - a plan to be carried out with the aid of a curious 3
drug he had learned of from a native "doctor" in Haiti. When he explained that 3
his idea concerned me, I became somewhat alarmed; though in my position there 3
could be little to make my plight worse. I had, indeed, considered more than 3
once the oblivion that would come with a revolver or a plunge from the roof to 3
the jagged rocks below. 3
3
On the day after his arrival, in the seclusion of the dimly lit study, he outlined 3
the whole grisly scheme. He had found in Haiti a drug, the formula for which he 3
would develop later, which induced a state of profound sleep in anyone taking 3
it; a trance so deep that death was closely counterfeited - with all muscular 3
reflexes, even the respiration and heart-beat, completely stilled for the time 3
being. Andrews had, he said, seen it demonstrated on natives many times. Some 3
of them remained somnolent for days at a time, wholly immobile and as much 3
like death as death itself. This suspended animation, he explained further, would 3
even pass the closest examination of any medical man. He himself, according to 3
all known laws, would have to report as dead a man under the influence of such 3
a drug. He stated, too, that the subject's body assumed the precise appearance of 3
a corpse - even a slight rigor mortis developing in prolonged cases. 3
3
3

3
3
3
For some time his purpose did not seem wholly clear, but when the full import of 3
his words became apparent I felt weak and nauseated. Yet in another way I was 3
relieved; for the thing meant at least a partial escape from my curse, an escape 3
from the banishment and shame of an ordinary death of the dread leprosy. 3
Briefly, his plan was to administer a strong dose of the drug to me and call the 3
local authorities, who would immediately pronounce me dead, and see that I 3
was buried within a very short while. He felt assured that with their careless 3
examination they would fail to notice my leprosy symptoms, which in truth had 3
hardly appeared. Only a trifle over fifteen months had passed since I had caught 3
the disease, whereas the corruption takes seven years to run its entire course. 3
3
Later, he said, would come resurrection. After my interment in the family 3
graveyard - beside my centuried dwelling and barely a quarter-mile from his 3
own ancient pile - the appropriate steps would be taken. Finally, when my estate 3
was settled and my decease widely known, he would secretly open the tomb and 3
bring me to his own abode again, still alive and none the worse for my 3
adventure. It seemed a ghastly and daring plan, but to me it offered the only 3
hope for even a partial freedom; so I accepted his proposition, but not without a 3
myriad of misgivings. What if the effect of the drug should wear off while I was 3
in my tomb? What if the coroner should discover the awful ruse, and fail to inter 3
me? These were some of the hideous doubts which assailed me before the 3
experiment. Though death would have been a release from my curse, I feared it 3
even worse than the yellow scourge; feared it even when I could see its black 3
wings constantly hovering over me. 3
3
Fortunately I was spared the horror of viewing my own funeral and burial rites. 3
They must, however, have gone just as Andrews had planned, even to the 3
subsequent disinterment; for after the initial dose of the poison from Haiti I 3
lapsed into a semi-paralytic state and from that to a profound, night-black sleep. 3
The drug had been administered in my room, and Andrews had told me before 3
giving it that he would recommend to the coroner a verdict of heart failure due 3
to nerve strain. Of course, there was no embalming - Andrews saw to that - and 3
the whole procedure, leading up to my secret transportation from the graveyard 3
to his crumbling manor, covered a period of three days. Having been buried late 3
in the afternoon of the third day, my body was secured by Andrews that very 3
night. He had replaced the fresh sod just as it had been when the workmen left. 3
Old Simes, sworn to secrecy, had helped Andrews in his ghoulish task. 3
3
Later I had lain for over a week in my old familiar bed. Owing to some 3
unexpected effect of the drug, my whole body was completely paralyzed, so that 3
I could move my head only slightly. All my senses, however, were fully alert, 3
and by another week's time I was able to take nourishment in good quantities. 3
Andrews explained that my body would gradually regain its former sensibilities; 3
3
3
3
1056 3
3
3
3
though owing to the presence of the leprosy it might take considerable time. He 3
seemed greatly interested in analyzing my daily symptoms, and always asked if 3
there was any feeling present in my body. 3
3
Many days passed before I was able to control any part of my anatomy, and 3
much longer before the paralysis crept from my enfeebled limbs so that I could 3
feel the ordinary bodily reactions. Lying and staring at my numb hulk was like 3
having it injected with a perpetual anesthetic. There was a total alienation I could 3
not understand, considering that my head and neck were quite alive and in good 3
health. 3
3
Andrews explained that he had revived my upper half first and could not 3
account for the complete bodily paralysis; though my condition seemed to 3
trouble him little considering the damnably intent interest he centered upon my 3
reactions and stimuli from the very beginning. Many times during lulls in our 3
conversation I would catch a strange gleam in his eyes as he viewed me on the 3
couch - a glint of victorious exultation which, queerly enough, he never voiced 3
aloud; though he seemed to be quite glad that I had run the gauntlet of death and 3
had come through alive. Still, there was that horror I was to meet in less than six 3
years, which added to my desolation and melancholy during the tedious days in 3
which I awaited the return of normal bodily functions. But I would be up and 3
about, he assured me, before very long, enjoying an existence few men had ever 3
experienced. The words did not, however, impress me with their true and 3
ghastly meaning until many days later. 3
3
During that awful siege in bed Andrews and I became somewhat estranged. He 3
no longer treated me so much like a friend as like an implement in his skilled and 3
greedy fingers. I found him possessed of unexpected traits - little examples of 3
baseness and cruelty, apparent even to the hardened Simes, which disturbed me 3
in a most unusual manner. Often he would display extraordinary cruelty to live 3
specimens in his laboratory, for he was constantly carrying on various hidden 3
projects in glandular and muscular transplantation on guinea-pigs and rabbits. 3
He had also been employing his newly discovered sleeping- potion in curious 3
experiments with suspended animation. But of these things he told me very little; 3
though old Simes often let slip chance comments which shed some light on the 3
proceedings. I was not certain how much the old servant knew, but he had surely 3
learned considerable, being a constant companion to both Andrews and myself. 3
3
With the passage of time, a slow but consistent feeling began creeping into my 3
disabled body; and at the reviving symptoms Andrews took a fanatical interest 3
in my case. He still seemed more coldly analytical than sympathetic toward me, 3
taking my pulse and heart-beat with more than usual zeal. Occasionally, in his 3
fevered examinations, I saw his hands tremble slightly - an uncommon sight 3
3
3
3
1057 3
3
3
3
with so skilled a surgeon - but he seemed oblivious of my scrutiny. I was never 3
allowed even a momentary glimpse of my full body, but with the feeble return of 3
the sense of touch, I was aware of a bulk and heaviness which at first seemed 3
awkward and unfamiliar. 3
3
Gradually I regained the use of my hands and arms; and with the passing of the 3
paralysis came a new and terrible sensation of physical estrangement. My limbs 3
had difficulty in following the commands of my mind, and every movement was 3
jerky and uncertain. So clumsy were my hands, that I had to become accustomed 3
to them all over again. This must, I thought, be due to my disease and the 3
advance of the contagion in my system. Being unaware of how the early 3
symptoms affected the victim (my brother's being a more advanced case), I had 3
no means of judging; and since Andrews shunned the subject, I deemed it better 3
to remain silent. 3
3
One day I asked Andrews - I no longer considered him a friend - if I might try 3
rising and sitting up in bed. At first he objected strenuously, but later, after 3
cautioning me to keep the blankets well up around my chin so that I would not 3
be chilled, he permitted it. This seemed strange, in view of the comfortable 3
temperature. Now that late autumn was slowly turning into winter, the room 3
was always well heated. A growing chilliness at night, and occasional glimpses 3
of a leaden sky through the window, had told me of the changing season; for no 3
calendar was ever in sight upon the dingy walls. With the gentle help of Simes I 3
was eased to a sitting position, Andrews coldly watching from the door to the 3
laboratory. At my success a slow smile spread across his leering features, and he 3
turned to disappear from the darkened doorway. His mood did nothing to 3
improve my condition. Old Simes, usually so regular and consistent, was now 3
often late in his duties, sometimes leaving me alone for hours at a time. 3
3
The terrible sense of alienation was heightened by my new position. It seemed 3
that the legs and arms inside my gown were hardly able to follow the 3
summoning of my mind, and it became mentally exhausting to continue 3
movement for any length of time. My fingers, woefully clumsy, were wholly 3
unfamiliar to my inner sense of touch, and I wondered vaguely if I were to be 3
accursed the rest of my days with an awkwardness induced by my dread 3
malady. 3
3
It was on the evening following my half-recovery that the dreams began. I was 3
tormented not only at night but during the day as well. I would awaken, 3
screaming horribly, from some frightful nightmare I dared not think about 3
outside the realm of sleep. These dreams consisted mainly of ghoulish things; 3
graveyards at night, stalking corpses, and lost souls amid a chaos of blinding 3
light and shadow. The terrible reality of the visions disturbed me most of all: it 3
3
3
3
1058 3
3
3
3
seemed that some inside influence was inducing the grisly vistas of moonlit 3
tombstones and endless catacombs of the restless dead. I could not place their 3
source; and at the end of a week I was quite frantic with abominable thoughts 3
which seemed to obtrude themselves upon my unwelcome consciousness. 3
3
By that time a slow plan was forming whereby I might escape the living hell into 3
which I had been propelled. Andrews cared less and less about me, seeming 3
intent only on my progress and growth and recovery of normal muscular 3
reactions. I was becoming every day more convinced of the nefarious doings 3
going on in that laboratory across the threshold - the animal cries were shocking, 3
and rasped hideously on my overwrought nerves. And I was gradually 3
beginning to think that Andrews had not saved me from deportation solely for 3
my own benefit, but for some accursed reason of his own. Simes's attention was 3
slowly becoming slighter and slighter, and I was convinced that the aged servitor 3
had a hand in the deviltry somewhere. Andrews no longer eyed me as a friend, 3
but as an object of experimentation; nor did I like the way he fingered his scalpel 3
when he stood in the narrow doorway and stared at me with crafty alertness. I 3
had never before seen such a transformation come over any man. His ordinarily 3
handsome features were now lined and whisker-grown, and his eyes gleamed as 3
if some imp of Satan were staring from them. His cold, calculating gaze made me 3
shudder horribly, and gave me a fresh determination to free myself from his 3
bondage as soon as possible. 3
3
I had lost track of time during my dream-orgy, and had no way of knowing how 3
fast the days were passing. The curtains were often drawn in the daytime, the 3
room being lit by waxen cylinders in the large candelabrum. It was a nightmare 3
of living horror and unreality; though through it all I was gradually becoming 3
stronger. I always gave careful responses to Andrews' inquiries concerning my 3
returning physical control, concealing the fact that a new life was vibrating 3
through me with every passing day - an altogether strange sort of strength, but 3
one which I was counting on to serve me in the coming crisis. 3
3
Finally, one chilly evening when the candles had been extinguished, and a pale 3
shaft of moonlight fell through the dark curtains upon my bed, I determined to 3
rise and carry out my plan of action. There had been no movement from either of 3
my captors for several hours, and I was confident that both were asleep in 3
adjoining bedchambers. Shifting my cumbersome weight carefully, I rose to a 3
sitting position and crawled cautiously out of bed, down upon the floor. A 3
vertigo gripped me momentarily, and a wave of weakness flooded my entire 3
being. But finally strength returned, and by clutching at a bed-post I was able to 3
stand upon my feet for the first time in many months. Gradually a new strength 3
coursed through me, and I donned the dark robe which I had seen hanging on a 3
nearby chair. It was quite long, but served as a cloak over my nightdress. Again 3
3
3
3
1059 3
3
3
3
came that feeling of awful unfamiliarity which I had experienced in bed; that 3
sense of alienation, and of difficulty in making my limbs perform as they should. 3
But there was need for haste before my feeble strength might give out. As a last 3
precaution in dressing, I slipped some old shoes over my feet; but though I could 3
have sworn they were my own, they seemed abnormally loose, so that I decided 3
they must belong to the aged Simes. 3
3
Seeing no other heavy objects in the room, I seized from the table the huge 3
candelabrum, upon which the moon shone with a pallid glow, and proceeded 3
very quietly toward the laboratory door. My first steps came jerkily and with 3
much difficulty, and in the semi-darkness I was unable to make my way very 3
rapidly. When I reached the threshold, a glance within revealed my former 3
friend seated in a large overstuffed chair; while beside him was a smoking-stand 3
upon which were assorted bottles and a glass. He reclined half-way in the 3
moonlight through the large window, and his greasy features were creased in a 3
drunken smirk. An opened book lay in his lap - one of the hideous tomes from 3
his private library. 3
3
For a long moment I gloated over the prospect before me, and then, stepping 3
forward suddenly, I brought the heavy weapon down upon his unprotected 3
head. The dull crunch was followed by a spurt of blood, and the fiend crumpled 3
to the floor, his head laid half open. I felt no contrition at taking the man's life in 3
such a manner. In the hideous, half-visible specimens of his surgical wizardry 3
scattered about the room in various stages of completion and preservation, I felt 3
there was enough evidence to blast his soul without my aid. Andrews had gone 3
too far in his practices to continue living, and as one of his monstrous specimens 3
3
- of that I was now hideously certain - it was my duty to exterminate him. 3
3
Simes, I realized, would be no such easy matter; indeed, only unusual good 3
fortune had caused me to find Andrews unconscious. When I finally reeled up to 3
the servant's bedchamber door, faint from exhaustion, I knew it would take all 3
my remaining strength to complete the ordeal. 3
3
The old man's room was in utmost darkness, being on the north side of the 3
structure, but he must have seen me silhouetted in the doorway as I came in. He 3
screamed hoarsely, and I aimed the candelabrum at him from the threshold. It 3
struck something soft, making a sloughing sound in the darkness; but the 3
screaming continued. From that time on events became hazy and jumbled 3
together, but I remember grappling with the man and choking the life from him 3
little by little. He gibbered a host of awful things before I could lay hands on him 3
3
- cried and begged for mercy from my clutching fingers. I hardly realized my 3
own strength in that mad moment which left Andrews' associate in a condition 3
like his own. 3
3
3
3
1060 3
3
3
3
Retreating from the darkened chamber, I stumbled for the stairway door, sagged 3
through it, and somehow reached the landing below. No lamps were burning, 3
and my only light was a filtering of moonbeams coming from the narrow 3
windows in the hall. But I made my jerky way over the cold, damp slabs of stone, 3
reeling from the terrible weakness of my exertion, and reached the front door 3
after ages of fumbling and crawling about in the darkness. 3
3
Vague memories and haunting shadows came to taunt me in that ancient 3
hallway; shadows once friendly and understandable, but now grown alien and 3
unrecognizable, so that I stumbled down the worn steps in a frenzy of something 3
more than fear. For a moment I stood in the shadow of the giant stone manor, 3
viewing the moonlit trail down which I must go to reach the home of my 3
forefathers, only a quarter of a mile distant. But the way seemed long, and for a 3
while I despaired of ever traversing the whole of it. 3
3
At last I grasped a piece of dead wood as a cane and set out down the winding 3
road. Ahead, seemingly only a few rods away in the moonlight, stood the 3
venerable mansion where my ancestors had lived and died. Its turrets rose 3
spectrally in the shimmering radiance, and the black shadow cast on the beetling 3
hillside appeared to shift and waver, as if belonging to a castle of unreal 3
substance. There stood the monument of half a century; a haven for all my family 3
old and young, which I had deserted many years ago to live with the fanatical 3
Andrews. It stood empty on that fateful night, and I hope that it may always 3
remain so. 3
3
In some manner I reached the aged place; though I do not remember the last half 3
of the journey at all. It was enough to be near the family cemetery, among whose 3
moss-covered and crumbling stones I would seek the oblivion I had desired. As I 3
approached the moonlit spot the old familiarity - so absent during my abnormal 3
existence - returned to plague me in a wholly unexpected way. I drew close to 3
my own tombstone, and the feeling of homecoming grew stronger; with it came 3
a fresh flood of that awful sense of alienation and disembodiment which I knew 3
so well. I was satisfied that the end was drawing near; nor did I stop to analyze 3
emotions till a little later, when the full horror of my position burst upon me. 3
3
Intuitively I knew my own tombstone; for the grass had scarcely begun to grow 3
between the pieces of sod. With feverish haste I began clawing at the mound, and 3
scraping the wet earth from the hole left by the removal of the grass and roots. 3
How long I worked in the nitrous soil before my fingers struck the coffin-lid, I 3
can never say; but sweat was pouring from me and my nails were but useless, 3
bleeding hooks. 3
3
3
3
1061 3
3
3
3
At last I threw out the last bit of loose earth, and with trembling fingers tugged 3
on the heavy lid. It gave a trifle; and I was prepared to lift it completely open 3
when a fetid and nauseous odor assailed my nostrils. I started erect, horrified. 3
Had some idiot placed my tombstone on the wrong grave, causing me to unearth 3
another body? For surely there could be no mistaking that awful stench. 3
Gradually a hideous uncertainty came over me and I scrambled from the hole. 3
One look at the newly made headpiece was enough. This was indeed my own 3
grave .. . but what fool had buried within it another corpse? 3
3
All at once a bit of the unspeakable truth propelled itself upon my brain. The 3
odor, in spite of its putrescence, seemed somehow familiar - horribly familiar. . . . 3
Yet I could not credit my senses with such an idea. Reeling and cursing, I fell into 3
the black cavity once more, and by the aid of a hastily lit match, lifted the long lid 3
completely open. Then the light went out, as if extinguished by a malignant 3
hand, and I clawed my way out of that accursed pit, screaming in a frenzy of fear 3
and loathing. 3
3
When I regained consciousness I was lying before the door of my own ancient 3
manor, where I must have crawled after that hideous rendezvous in the family 3
cemetery. I realized that dawn was close at hand, and rose feebly, opening the 3
aged portal before me and entering the place which had known no footsteps for 3
over a decade. A fever was ravaging my weakened body, so that I was hardly 3
able to stand, but I made my way slowly through the musty, dimly lit chambers 3
and staggered into my own study - the study I had deserted so many years 3
before. 3
3
When the sun has risen, I shall go to the ancient well beneath the old willow tree 3
by the cemetery and cast my deformed self into it. No other man shall ever view 3
this blasphemy which has survived life longer than it should have. I do not know 3
what people will say when they see my disordered grave, but this will not 3
trouble me if I can find oblivion from that which I beheld amidst the crumbling, 3
moss- crusted stones of the hideous place. 3
3
I know now why Andrews was so secretive in his actions; so damnably gloating 3
in his attitude toward me after my artificial death. He had meant me for a 3
specimen all the time - a specimen of his greatest feat of surgery, his masterpiece 3
of unclean witchery ... an example of perverted artistry for him alone to see. 3
Where Andrews obtained that other with which I lay accursed in his moldering 3
mansion I shall probably never know; but I am afraid that it was brought from 3
Haiti along with his fiendish medicine. At least these long hairy arms and 3
horrible short legs are alien to me ... alien to all natural and sane laws of 3
mankind. The thought that I shall be tortured with that other during the rest of 3
my brief existence is another hell. 3
3
3
3
1062 3
3
3
3
Now I can but wish for that which once was mine; that which every man blessed 3
of God ought to have at death; that which I saw in that awful moment in the 3
ancient burial ground when I raised the lid on the coffin - my own shrunken, 3
decayed, and headless body. 3

(INTRODUCTORY NOTE: The following very singular narrative, or record of 3
impressions, was discovered under circumstances so extraordinary that they 3
deserve careful description. On the evening of Wednesday, August 27, 1913, at 3
about eight-thirty o'clock, the population of the small seaside village of 3
Potowonket, Maine, U.S.A., was aroused by a thunderous report accompanied 3
by a blinding flash; and persons near the shore beheld a mammoth ball of fire 3
dart from the heavens into the sea but a short distance out, sending up a 3
prodigious column of water. The following Sunday a fishing party composed of 3
John Richmond, Peter B. Carr, and Simon Canfield, caught in their trawl and 3
dragged ashore a mass of metallic rock, weighing 360 pounds, and looking (as 3
Mr. Canfield said) like a piece of slag. Most of the inhabitants agreed that this 3
heavy body was none other than the fireball which had fallen from the sky four 3
days before; and Dr. Richard M. Jones, the local scientific authority, allowed that 3
it must be an aerolite or meteoric stone. In chipping off specimens to send to an 3
expert Boston analyst. Dr. Jones discovered imbedded in the semi-metallic mass 3
the strange book containing the ensuing tale, which is still in his possession. 3
3
In form the discovery resembles an ordinary note-book, about 5X3 inches in 3
size, and containing thirty leaves. In material, however it presents marked 3
peculiarities. The covers are apparently of some dark stony substance unknown 3
to geologists, and unbreakable by any mechanical means. No chemical reagent 3
seems to act upon them. The leaves are much the same, save that they are lighter 3
in colour, and so infinitely thin as to be quite flexible. The whole is bound by 3
some process not very clear to those who have observed it; a process involving 3
the adhesion of the leaf substance to the cover substance. These substances 3
cannot now be separated, nor can the leaves be torn by any amount of force. The 3
writing is Greek of the purest classical quality, and several students of 3
palaeography declare that the characters are in a cursive hand used about the 3
second century B. C. There is little in the text to determine the date. The 3
mechanical mode of writing cannot be deduced beyond the fact that it must have 3
resembled that of the modern slate and slate-pencil. During the course of 3
analytical efforts made by the late Professor Chambers of Harvard, several pages, 3
mostly at the conclusion of the narrative, were blurred to the point of utter 3
effacement before being read; a circumstance forming a well-nigh irreparable 3
3
3
3
1064 3
3
3
3
loss. What remains of the contents was done into modem Greek letters by the 3
palaeographer, Rutherford, and in this form submitted to the translators. 3
3
Professor Mayfield of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, who examined 3
samples of the strange stone, declares it a true meteorite; an opinion in which Dr. 3
von Winterfeldt of Heidelberg (interned in 1918 as a dangerous enemy alien) 3
does not concur. Professor Bradley of Columbia College adopts a less dogmatic 3
ground; pointing out that certain utterly unknown ingredients are present in 3
large quantities, and warning that no classification is as yet possible. 3
3
The presence, nature, and message of the strange book form so momentous a 3
problem, that no explanation can even be attempted. The text, as far as 3
preserved, is here rendered as literally as our language permits, in the hope that 3
some reader may eventually hit upon an interpretation and solve one of the 3
greatest scientific mysteries of recent years.) 3
3
It was a narrow place, and I was alone. On one side, beyond a margin of vivid 3
waving green, was the sea; blue; bright, and billowy, and send-ing up vaporous 3
exhalations which intoxicated me. So profuse, indeed, were these exhalations, 3
that they gave me an odd impression of a coales-cence of sea and sky; for the 3
heavens were likewise bright and blue. On the other side was the forest, ancient 3
almost as the sea itself, and stretch-ing infinitely inland. It was very dark, for the 3
trees were grotesquely huge and luxuriant, and incredibly numerous. Their giant 3
trunks were of a horrible green which blended weirdly with the narrow green 3
tract whereon I stood. At some distance away, on either side of me, the strange 3
forest extended down to the water's edge, obliterating the shore line and 3
completely hemming in the narrow tract. Some of the trees, I observed, stood in 3
the water itself; as though impatient of any barrier to their progress. 3
3
I saw no living thing, nor sign that any living thing save myself had ever existed. 3
The sea and the sky and the wood encircled me, and reached off into regions 3
beyond my imagination. Nor was there any sound save of the wind-tossed wood 3
and of the sea. 3
3
As I stood in this silent place, I suddenly commenced to tremble; for though I 3
knew not how I came there, and could scarce remember what my name and rank 3
had been, I felt that I should go mad if I could understand what lurked about me. 3
I recalled things I had learned, things I had dreamed, things I had imagined and 3
yearned for in some other distant life. I thought of long nights when I had gazed 3
up at the stars of heaven and cursed the gods that my free soul could not traverse 3
the vast abysses which were inaccessible to my body. I conjured up ancient 3
blasphemies, and terrible delvings into the papri of Democritus; but as memories 3
appeared, I shuddered in deeper fear, for I knew that I was alone - horribly 3
3
3
3
1065 3
3
3
3
alone. Alone, yet dose to sentient impulses of vast, vague kind; which I prayed 3
never to comprehend nor encounter. In the voice of the swaying green branches I 3
fancied I could detect a kind of malignant hatred and demoniac triumph. 3
Sometimes they struck me as being in horrible colloquy with ghastly and 3
unthinkable things which the scaly green bodies of the trees half-hid; hid from 3
sight but not from consciousness. The most oppressive of my sensations was a 3
sinister feeling of alienage. Though I saw about me objects which I could name; 3
trees, grass, sea, and sky; I felt that their relation to me was not the same as that 3
of the trees, grass, sea, and sky I knew in another and dimly remembered life. 3
The nature of the difference I could not tell, yet I shook in stark fright as And 3
then, in a spot where I had before discerned nothing but the misty sea, I beheld 3
the Green Meadow; separated from me by a vast expanse of blue rippling water 3
with suntipped wavelets, yet strangely near. Often I would peep fearfully over 3
my right shoulder at the trees, but I preferred to look at the Green Meadow, 3
which affected me oddly. 3
3
It was while my eyes were fixed upon this singular tract, that I first felt the 3
ground in motion beneath me. Beginning with a kind of throbbing agitation 3
which held a fiendish suggestion of conscious action, the bit of bank on which I 3
stood detached itself from the grassy shore and commenced to float away; borne 3
slowly onward as if by some current of resistless force. I did not move, 3
astonished and startled as I was by the unprecedented phenomenon; but stood 3
rigidly still until a wide lane of water yawned betwixt me and the land of trees. 3
Then I sat down in a sort of daze, and again looked at the sun-tipped water and 3
the Green Meadow. 3
3
Behind me the trees and the things they may have been hiding seemed to radiate 3
infinite menace. This I knew without turning to view them, for as I grew more 3
used to the scene I became less and less depen-dent upon the five senses that 3
once had been my sole reliance. I knew the green scaly forest hated me, yet now I 3
was safe from it, for my bit of bank had drifted far from the shore. 3
3
But though one peril was past, another loomed up before me. Pieces of earth 3
were constantly crumbling from the floating isle which held me, so that death 3
could not be far distant in any event. Yet even then I seemed to sense that death 3
would be death to me no more, for I turned again to watch the Green Meadow, 3
imbued with a curious feeling of security in strange contrast to my general 3
horror. 3
3
Then it was that I heard, at a distance immeasurable, the sound of falling water. 3
Not that of any trival cascade such as I had known, but that which might be 3
heard in the far Scythian lands if all the Mediterranean were poured down an 3
3
3
3
1066 3
3
3
3
unfathomable abyss. It was toward this sound that my shrinking island was 3
drifting, yet I was content. 3
3
Far in the rear were happening weird and terrible things; things which I turned 3
to view, yet shivered to behold. For in the sky dark vaporous forms hovered 3
fantastically, brooding over trees and seeming to answer the challenge of the 3
waving green branches. Then a thick mist arose from the sea to join the sky- 3
forms, and the shore was erased from my sight. Though the sun - what sun I 3
knew not - shone brightly on the water around me, the land I had left seemed 3
involved in a demoniac tempest where dashed the will of the hellish trees and 3
what they hid, with that of the sky and the sea. And when the mist vanished, I 3
saw only the blue sky and the blue sea, for the land and the trees were no more. 3
3
It was at this point that my attention was arrested by the singing in the Green 3
Meadow. Hitherto, as I have said, I had encountered no sign of human life; but 3
now there arose to my ears a dull chant whose origin and nature were 3
apparently unmistakable. While the words were utterly undistinguishable, the 3
chant awaked in me a peculiar train of associations; and I was reminded of some 3
vaguely disquieting lines I had once translated out of an Egyptian book, which in 3
turn were taken from a papyrus of ancient Meroe. Through my brain ran lines 3
that I fear to repeat; lines telling of very antique things and forms of life in the 3
days when our earth was exceeding young. Of things which thought and moved 3
and were alive, yet which gods and men would not consider alive. It was a 3
strange book. 3
3
As I listened, I became gradually conscious of a circumstance which had before 3
puzzled me only subconsciously. At no time had my sight distinguished any 3
definite objects in the Green Meadow, an impression of vivid homogeneous 3
verdure being the sum total of my perception. Now, however, I saw that the 3
current would cause my island to pass the shore at but a little distance; so that I 3
might learn more of the land and of the singing thereon. My curiosity to behold 3
the singers had mounted high, though it was mingled with apprehension. 3
3
Bits of sod continued to break away from the tiny tract which carried me, but I 3
heeded not their loss; for I felt that I was not to die with the body (or appearance 3
of a body) which I seemed to possess. That everything about me, even life and 3
death, was illusory; that I had overleaped the bounds of mortality and corporeal 3
entity, becoming a free, detached thing; impressed me as almost certain. Of my 3
location I knew nothing, save that I felt I could not be on the earth-planet once so 3
familiar to me. My sensations, apart from a kind of haunting terror, were those of 3
a traveller just embarked upon an unending voyage of discovery. For a moment I 3
thought of the lands and persons I had left behind; and of strange ways whereby 3
3
3
3
1067 3
3
3
3
I might some day tell them of my adventurings, even though I might never 3
return. 3
3
I had now floated very near the Green Meadow, so that the voices were clear and 3
distinct; but though I knew many languages I could not quite interpret the words 3
of the chanting. Familiar they indeed were, as I had subtly felt when at a greater 3
distance, but beyond a sensation of vague and awesome remembrance I could 3
make nothing of them. A most extraordinary quality in the voices-a quality 3
which I cannot describe-at once frightened and fascinated me. My eyes could 3
now discern several things amidst the omnipresent verdure- rocks, covered with 3
I bright green moss, shrubs of considerable height, and less definable shapes of 3
great magnitude which seemed to move or vibrate amidst the shrubbery in a 3
peculiar way. The chanting, whose authors I was so anxious to glimpse, seemed 3
loudest, at points where these shapes were most numerous and most vigorously 3
in motion. 3
3
And then, as my island drifted closer and the sound of the distant waterfall grew 3
louder, I saw clearly the source of the chanting, and in one horrible instant 3
remembered everything. Of such things I cannot, dare not tell, for therein was 3
revealed the hideous solution of all which had puzzled me; and that solution 3
would drive you mad, even as it al-most drove me.... I knew now the change 3
through which I had passed, and through which certain others who once were 3
men had passed! and I knew the endless cycle of the future which none like me 3
may escape... I shall live forever, be conscious forever, though my soul cries out 3
to the gods for the boon of death and oblivion... All is before me: beyond the 3
deafening torrent lies the land of Stethelos, where young men are infinitely old. . . 3
The Green Meadow... I will send a message across the horrible immeasurable 3
abyss.... 3

The Horror at Martin's Beach - with 3

Published November 1923 in Weird Tales, Vol. 2, No. 4, p. 75-76, 83 3
3
I have never heard an even approximately adequate explanation of the horror at 3
Martin's Beach. Despite the large number of witnesses, no two accounts agree; 3
and the testimony taken by local authorities contains the most amazing 3
discrepancies. 3
3
Perhaps this haziness is natural in view of the unheard-of character of the horror 3
itself, the almost paralytic terror of all who saw it, and the efforts made by the 3
fashionable Wavecrest Inn to hush it up after the publicity created by Prof. 3
Ahon's article "Are Hypnotic Powers Confined to Recognized Humanity?" 3
3
Against all these obstacles I am striving to present a coherent version; for I 3
beheld the hideous occurrence, and believe it should be known in view of the 3
appalling possibilities it suggests. Martin's Beach is once more popular as a 3
watering-place, but I shudder when I think of it. Indeed, I cannot look at the 3
ocean at all now without shuddering. 3
3
Fate is not always without a sense of drama and climax, hence the terrible 3
happening of August 8, 1922, swiftly followed a period of minor and agreeably 3
wonder-fraught excitement at Martin's Beach. On May 17 the crew of the fishing 3
smack Alma of Gloucester, under Capt. James P. Orne, killed, after a battle of 3
nearly forty hours, a marine monster whose size and aspect produced the 3
greatest possible stir in scientific circles and caused certain Boston naturalists to 3
take every precaution for its taxidermic preservation. 3
3
The object was some fifty feet in length, of roughly cylindrical shape, and about 3
ten feet in diameter. It was unmistakably a gilled fish in its major affiliations; but 3
with certain curious modifications such as rudimentary forelegs and six-toed feet 3
in place of pectoral fins, which prompted the widest speculation. Its 3
extraordinary mouth, its thick and scaly hide, and its single, deep-set eye were 3
wonders scarcely less remarkable than its colossal dimensions; and when the 3
naturalists pronounced it an infant organism, which could not have been hatched 3
more than a few days, public interest mounted to extraordinary heights. 3
3
Capt. Orne, with typical Yankee shrewdness, obtained a vessel large enough to 3
hold the object in its hull, and arranged for the exhibition of his prize. With 3
3
3
3
1069 3
3
3
3
judicious carpentry he prepared what amounted to an excellent marine museum, 3
and, sailing south to the wealthy resort district of Martin's Beach, anchored at the 3
hotel wharf and reaped a harvest of admission fees. 3
3
The intrinsic marvelousness of the object, and the importance which it clearly 3
bore in the minds of many scientific visitors from near and far, combined to 3
make it the season's sensation. That it was absolutely unique - unique to a 3
scientifically revolutionary degree - was well understood. The naturalists had 3
shown plainly that it radically differed from the similarly immense fish caught 3
off the Florida coast; that, while it was obviously an inhabitant of almost 3
incredible depths, perhaps thousands of feet, its brain and principal organs 3
indicated a development startlingly vast, and out of all proportion to anything 3
hitherto associated with the fish tribe. 3
3
On the morning of July 20 the sensation was increased by the loss of the vessel 3
and its strange treasure. In the storm of the preceding night it had broken from 3
its moorings and vanished forever from the sight of man, carrying with it the 3
guard who had slept aboard despite the threatening weather. Capt. Orne, backed 3
by extensive scientific interests and aided by large numbers of fishing boats from 3
Gloucester, made a thorough and exhaustive searching cruise, but with no result 3
other than the prompting of interest and conversation. By August 7 hope was 3
abandoned, and Capt. Orne had returned to the Wavecrest Inn to wind up his 3
business affairs at Martin's Beach and confer with certain of the scientific men 3
who remained there. The horror came on August 8. 3
3
It was in the twilight, when grey sea-birds hovered low near the shore and a 3
rising moon began to make a glittering path across the waters. The scene is 3
important to remember, for every impression counts. On the beach were several 3
strollers and a few late bathers; stragglers from the distant cottage colony that 3
rose modestly on a green hill to the north, or from the adjacent cliff-perched Inn 3
whose imposing towers proclaimed its allegiance to wealth and grandeur. 3
3
Well within viewing distance was another set of spectators, the loungers on the 3
Inn's high-ceiled and lantern-lighted veranda, who appeared to be enjoying the 3
dance music from the sumptuous ballroom inside. These spectators, who 3
included Capt. Orne and his group of scientific confreres, joined the beach group 3
before the horror progressed far; as did many more from the Inn. Certainly there 3
was no lack of witnesses, confused though their stories be with fear and doubt of 3
what they saw. 3
3
There is no exact record of the time the thing began, although a majority say that 3
the fairly round moon was "about a foot" above the low-lying vapors of the 3
horizon. They mention the moon because what they saw seemed subtly 3

connected with it - a sort of stealthy, dehberate, menacing ripple which rolled in 3
from the far skyline along the shimmering lane of reflected moonbeams, yet 3
which seemed to subside before it reached the shore. 3
3
Many did not notice this ripple until reminded by later events; but it seems to 3
have been very marked, differing in height and motion from the normal waves 3
around it. Some called it cunning and calculating. And as it died away craftily by 3
the black reefs afar out, there suddenly came belching up out of the glitter- 3
streaked brine a cry of death; a scream of anguish and despair that moved pity 3
even while it mocked it. 3
3
First to respond to the cry were the two life guards then on duty; sturdy fellows 3
in white bathing attire, with their calling proclaimed in large red letters across 3
their chests. Accustomed as they were to rescue work, and to the screams of the 3
drowning, they could find nothing familiar in the unearthly ululation; yet with a 3
trained sense of duty they ignored the strangeness and proceeded to follow their 3
usual course. 3
3
Hastily seizing an air-cushion, which with its attached coil of rope lay always at 3
hand, one of them ran swiftly along the shore to the scene of the gathering 3
crowd; whence, after whirling it about to gain momentum, he flung the hollow 3
disc far out in the direction from which the sound had come. As the cushion 3
disappeared in the waves, the crowd curiously awaited a sight of the hapless 3
being whose distress had been so great; eager to see the rescue made by the 3
massive rope. 3
3
But that rescue was soon acknowledged to be no swift and easy matter; for, pull 3
as they might on the rope, the two muscular guards could not move the object at 3
the other end. Instead, they found that object pulling with equal or even greater 3
force in the very opposite direction, till in a few seconds they were dragged off 3
their feet and into the water by the strange power which had seized on the 3
proffered life- preserver. 3
3
One of them, recovering himself, called immediately for help from the crowd on 3
the shore, to whom he flung the remaining coil of rope; and in a moment the 3
guards were seconded by all the hardier men, among whom Capt. Orne was 3
foremost. More than a dozen strong hands were now tugging desperately at the 3
stout line, yet wholly without avail. 3
3
Hard as they tugged, the strange force at the other end tugged harder; and since 3
neither side relaxed for an instant, the rope became rigid as steel with the 3
enormous strain. The struggling participants, as well as the spectators, were by 3
this time consumed with curiosity as to the nature of the force in the sea. The 3
3
3
3
1071 3
3
3
3
idea of a drowning man had long been dismissed; and hints of whales, 3
submarines, monsters, and demons now passed freely around. Where humanity 3
had first led the rescuers, wonder kept them at their task; and they hauled with a 3
grim determination to uncover the mystery. 3
3
It being decided at last that a whale must have swallowed the air-cushion, Capt. 3
Orne, as a natural leader, shouted to those on shore that a boat must be obtained 3
in order to approach, harpoon, and land the unseen leviathan. Several men at 3
once prepared to scatter in quest of a suitable craft, while others came to 3
supplant the captain at the straining rope, since his place was logically with 3
whatever boat party might be formed. His own idea of the situation was very 3
broad, and by no means limited to whales, since he had to do with a monster so 3
much stranger. He wondered what might be the acts and manifestations of an 3
adult of the species of which the fifty -foot creature had been the merest infant. 3
3
And now there developed with appalling suddenness the crucial fact which 3
changed the entire scene from one of wonder to one of horror, and dazed with 3
fright the assembled band of toilers and onlookers. Capt. Orne, turning to leave 3
his post at the rope, found his hands held in their place with unaccountable 3
strength; and in a moment he realized that he was unable to let go of the rope. 3
His plight was instantly divined, and as each companion tested his own situation 3
the same condition was encountered. The fact could not be denied - every 3
struggler was irresistibly held in some mysterious bondage to the hempen line 3
which was slowly, hideously, and relentlessly pulling them out to sea. 3
3
Speechless horror ensued; a horror in which the spectators were petrified to utter 3
inaction and mental chaos. Their complete demoralization is reflected in the 3
conflicting accounts they give, and the sheepish excuses they offer for their 3
seemingly callous inertia. I was one of them, and know. 3
3
Even the strugglers, after a few frantic screams and futile groans, succumbed to 3
the paralyzing influence and kept silent and fatalistic in the face of unknown 3
powers. There they stood in the pallid moonlight, blindly pulling against a 3
spectral doom and swaying monotonously backward and forward as the water 3
rose first to their knees, then to their hips. The moon went partly under a cloud, 3
and in the half-light the line of swaying men resembled some sinister and 3
gigantic centipede, writhing in the clutch of a terrible creeping death. 3
3
Harder and harder grew the rope, as the tug in both directions increased, and the 3
strands swelled with the undisturbed soaking of the rising waves. Slowly the 3
tide advanced, till the sands so lately peopled by laughing children and 3
whispering lovers were now swallowed by the inexorable flow. The herd of 3
panic- stricken watchers surged blindly backward as the water crept above their 3
3
3
3
1072 3
3
3
3
feet, while the frightful line of strugglers swayed hideously on, half submerged, 3
and now at a substantial distance from their audience. Silence was complete. 3
3
The crowd, having gained a huddling-place beyond reach of the tide, stared in 3
mute fascination; without offering a word of advice or encouragement, or 3
attempting any kind of assistance. There was in the air a nightmare fear of 3
impending evils such as the world had never before known. 3
3
Minutes seemed lengthened into hours, and still that human snake of swaying 3
torsos was seen above the fast rising tide. Rhythmically it undulated; slowly, 3
horribly, with the seal of doom upon it. Thicker clouds now passed over the 3
ascending moon, and the glittering path on the waters faded nearly out. 3
3
Very dimly writhed the serpentine line of nodding heads, with now and then the 3
livid face of a backward- glancing victim gleaming pale in the darkness. Faster 3
and faster gathered the clouds, till at length their angry rifts shot down sharp 3
tongues of febrile flame. Thunders rolled, softly at first, yet soon increasing to a 3
deafening, maddening intensity. Then came a culminating crash - a shock whose 3
reverberations seemed to shake land and sea alike - and on its heels a cloudburst 3
whose drenching violence overpowered the darkened world as if the heavens 3
themselves had opened to pour forth a vindictive torrent. 3
3
The spectators, instinctively acting despite the absence of conscious and coherent 3
thought, now retreated up the cliff steps to the hotel veranda. Rumors had 3
reached the guests inside, so that the refugees found a state of terror nearly equal 3
to their own. I think a few frightened words were uttered, but cannot be sure. 3
3
Some, who were staying at the Inn, retired in terror to their rooms; while others 3
remained to watch the fast sinking victims as the line of bobbing heads showed 3
above the mounting waves in the fitful lightning flashes. I recall thinking of those 3
heads, and the bulging eyes they must contain; eyes that might well reflect all the 3
fright, panic, and delirium of a malignant universe - all the sorrow, sin, and 3
misery, blasted hopes and unfulfilled desires, fear, loathing and anguish of the 3
ages since time's beginning; eyes alight with all the soul-racking pain of eternally 3
blazing infernos. 3
3
And as I gazed out beyond the heads, my fancy conjured up still another eye; a 3
single eye, equally alight, yet with a purpose so revolting to my brain that the 3
vision soon passed. Held in the clutches of an unknown vise, the line of the 3
damned dragged on; their silent screams and unuttered prayers known only to 3
the demons of the black waves and the night-wind. 3
3
3
3
1073 3
3
3
3
There now burst from the infuriate sky such a mad cataclysm of satanic sound 3
that even the former crash seemed dwarfed. Amidst a bhnding glare of 3
descending fire the voice of heaven resounded with the blasphemies of hell, and 3
the mingled agony of all the lost reverberated in one apocalyptic, planet-rending 3
peal of Cyclopean din. It was the end of the storm, for with uncanny suddenness 3
the rain ceased and the moon once more cast her pallid beams on a strangely 3
quieted sea. 3
3
There was no line of bobbing heads now. The waters were calm and deserted, 3
and broken only by the fading ripples of what seemed to be a whirlpool far out 3
in the path of the moonlight whence the strange cry had first come. But as I 3
looked along that treacherous lane of silvery sheen, with fancy fevered and 3
senses overwrought, there trickled upon my ears from some abysmal sunken 3
waste the faint and sinister echoes of a laugh. 3

Few persons know the inside of the Clarendon story, or even that there is an 3
inside not reached by the newspapers. It was a San Francisco sensation in the 3
days before the fire, both because of the panic and menace that kept it company, 3
and because of its close linkage with the governor of the state. Governor Dalton, 3
it will be recalled, was Clarendon's best friend, and later married his sister. 3
Neither Dalton nor Mrs. Dalton would ever discuss the painful affair, but 3
somehow the facts leaked out to a limited circle. But for that, and for the years 3
which have give a sort of vagueness and impersonality to the actors, one would 3
still pause before probing into secrets so strictly guarded at the time. 3
3
The appointment of Dr. Alfred Clarendon as medical director of San Quentin 3
Penitentiary in 189- was greeted with the keenest enthusiasm throughout 3
California. San Francisco had at last the honour of harbouring one of the great 3
biologists and physicians of the period, and solid pathological leaders from all 3
over the world might be expected to flock thither to study his methods, profit by 3
his advice and researches, and learn how to cope with their own local problems. 3
California, almost over night, would become a centre of medical scholarship with 3
earthwide influence and reputation. 3
3
Governor Dalton, anxious to spread the news in its fullest significance, saw to it 3
that the press carried ample and dignified accounts of his new appointee. 3
Pictures of Dr. Clarendon and his new home near old Goat Hill, sketches of his 3
career and manifold honours, and popular accounts of his salient scientific 3
discoveries were all presented in the principal California dailies, till the public 3
soon felt a sort of reflected pride in the man whose studies of pyemia in India, of 3
the pest in China, and of every sort of kindred disorder elsewhere would soon 3
enrich the world of medicine with an antitoxin of revolutionary importance - a 3
basic antitoxin combating the whole febrile principle at its very source, and 3
ensuring the ultimate conquest and extirpation of fever in all its diverse forms. 3
3
Back of the appointments stretched an extended and now wholly unromantic 3
history of early friendship, long separation, and dramatically renewed 3
acquaintance. James Dalton and the clarendon family had been friends in New 3
York ten years before - friends and more than friends, since the doctor's only 3
3
3
3
1075 3
3
3
3
sister, Georgina, was the sweetheart of Dahon's youth, while the doctor himself 3
had been his closest associate and almost his protege, in the days of school and 3
college. The father of Alfred and Georgina, a Wall Street pirate of the ruthless 3
elder breed, had known Dalton's father well; so well, indeed, that he had finally 3
stripped him of all he possessed in a memorable afternoon's fight on the stock 3
exchange. Dalton Senior, hopeless of recuperation and wishing to give his one 3
adored child the benefit of his insurance, had promptly blown out his brains; but 3
James had not sought to retaliate. It was, as he viewed it, all in the game; and he 3
wished no harm to the father of the girl he meant to marry and of the budding 3
young scientist whose admirer and protector he had been throughout their years 3
of fellowship and study. Instead, he turned to the law, established himself in a 3
small way, and in due course asked 'Old Clarendon' for Georgina's hand. 3
3
Old Clarendon had refused very firmly and loudly, vowing that no pauper and 3
upstart lawyer was fit to be his son-in-law; and a scene of considerable violence 3
had occurred. James, telling the wrinkled freebooter at last what he ought to 3
have been told long before, had left the house and the city in a high temper; and 3
was embarked within a month upon the California life which was to lead him to 3
the governorship through many a fight with ring and politician. His farewells to 3
Alfred and Georgina had been brief, and he had never known the aftermath of 3
that scene in the Clarendon library. Only by a day did he miss the news of Old 3
Clarendon's death from apoplexy, and by so missing it, changed the course of his 3
whole career. He had not written Georgina in the decade that followed; knowing 3
her loyalty to her father, and waiting till his own fortune and position might 3
remove all obstacles to the match. Nor had he sent any word to Alfred, whose 3
calm indifference in the face of affection and hero-worship had always savoured 3
of conscious destiny and the self-sufficiency of genius. Secure in the ties of a 3
constancy rare even then, he had worked and risen with thoughts only of the 3
future; still a bachelor, and with a perfect intuitive faith that Georgina was also 3
waiting. 3
3
In this faith Dalton was not deceived. Wondering perhaps why no message ever 3
came, Georgina found no romance save in her dreams and expectations; and in 3
the course of time became busy with the new responsibilities brought by her 3
brother's rise to greatness. Alfred's growth had not belied the promise of his 3
youth, and the slim boy had darted quietly up the steps of science with a speed 3
and permanence almost dizzying to contemplate. Lean and ascetic, with steel- 3
rimmed pince-nez and pointed brown beard. Dr. Alfred Clarendon was an 3
authority at twenty-five and an international figure at thirty. Careless of worldly 3
affairs with the negligence of genius, he depended vastly on the care and 3
management of his sister, and was secretly thankful that her memories of James 3
had kept her from other and more tangible alliances. 3
3
3
3

3
3
3
Georgina conducted the business and household of the great bacteriologist, and 3
was proud of his strides toward the conquest of fever. She bore patiently with his 3
eccentricism, calmed his occasional bouts of fanaticism, and healed those 3
breaches with his friends which now and then resulted from his unconcealed 3
scorn of anything less than a single-minded devotion to pure truth and its 3
progress. Clarendon was undeniably irritating at times to ordinary folk; for he 3
never tired of depreciating the service of the individual as contrasted with the 3
service of mankind as a whole, and in censuring men of learning who mingled 3
domestic life or outside interests with their pursuit of abstract science. His 3
enemies called him a bore; but his admirers, pausing before the white heat of 3
ecstasy into which he would work himself, became almost ashamed of ever 3
having any standards or aspirations outside the one divine sphere of unalloyed 3
knowledge. 3
3
The doctor's travels were extensive and Georgina generally accompanied him on 3
the shorter ones. Three times, however, he had taken long, lone jaunts to strange 3
and distant places in his studies of exotic fevers and half-fabulous plagues; for he 3
knew that it is out of the unknown lands of cryptic and immemorial Asia that 3
most of the earth's diseases spring. On each of these occasions he had brought 3
back curious mementoes which added to the eccentricity of his home, not least 3
among which was the needlessly large staff of Thibetan servants picked up 3
somewhere in U-tsang during an epidemic of which the world never heard, but 3
amidst which Clarendon had discovered and isolated the germ of black fever. 3
These men, taller than most Thibetans and clearly belonging to a stock but little 3
investigated in the outside world, were of a skeletonic leanness which made one 3
wonder whether the doctor had sought to symbolise in them the anatomical 3
models of his college years. Their aspect, in the loose black silk robes of Bonpa 3
priests which he chose to give them, was grotesque in the highest degree; and 3
there was an unsmiling silence and stiffness in their motions which enhanced 3
their air of fantasy and gave Georgina a queer, awed feeling of having stumbled 3
into the pages of Vathek or the Arabian Nights. 3
3
But queerest of all was the general factotum or clinic-man, whom Clarendon 3
addressed as Surama, and whom he had brought back with him after a long stay 3
in Northern Africa, during which he had studied certain odd intermittent fevers 3
among the mysterious Saharan Tuaregs, whose descent from the primal race of 3
lost Atlantis is an old archaeological rumour. Surama, a man of great intelligence 3
and seemingly inexhaustible erudition, was as morbidly lean as the Thibetan 3
servants; with swarthy, parchment-like skin drawn so tightly over his bald pate 3
and hairless face that every line of the skull stood out in ghastly prominence - 3
this death's-head effect being heightened by lustrelessly burning black eyes set 3
with a depth which left to common visibility only a pair of dark, vacant sockets. 3
Unlike the ideal subordinate, he seemed despite his impassive features to spend 3
3
3
3
1077 3
3
3
3
no effort in concealing such emotions as he possessed. Instead, he carried about 3
an insidious atmosphere of irony or amusement, accompanied at certain 3
moments by a deep, guttural chuckle like that of a giant turtle which has just torn 3
to pieces some furry animal and is ambling away towards the sea. His race 3
appeared to be Caucasian, but could not be classified more clearly than that. 3
Some of Clarendon's friends thought he looked like a high-caste Hindoo 3
notwithstanding his accentless speech, while many agreed with Georgina - who 3
disliked him - when she gave her opinion that a Pharaoh's mummy, if 3
miraculously brought to life, would form a very apt twin for this sardonic 3
skeleton. 3
3
Dalton, absorbed in his uphill political battles and isolated from Eastern interests 3
through the peculiar self-sufficiency of the old West, had not followed the 3
meteoric rise of his former comrade; Clarendon had actually heard nothing of 3
one so far outside his chosen world of science as the governor. Being of 3
independent and even of abundant means, the Clarendons had for many years 3
stuck to their old Manhattan mansion in East Nineteenth Street, whose ghosts 3
must have looked sorely askance at the bizarrerie of Surama and the Thibetans. 3
Then, through the doctor's wish to transfer his base of medical observation, the 3
great change had suddenly come, and they had crossed the continent to take up a 3
secluded life in San Francisco; buying the gloomy old Bannister place near Goat 3
Hill, overlooking the bay, and establishing their strange household in a rambling, 3
French-roofed relic of mid-Victorian design and gold-rush parvenu display, set 3
amidst high-walled grounds in a region still half suburban. 3
3
Dr. Clarendon, though better satisfied than in New York, still felt cramped for 3
lack of opportunities to apply and test his pathological theories. Unworldly as he 3
was, he had never thought of using his reputation as an influence to gain public 3
appointment; though more and more he realised that only the medical 3
directorship of a government or a charitable institution - a prison, almshouse, or 3
hospital - would give him a field of sufficient width to complete his researches 3
and make his discoveries of the greatest use to humanity and science at large. 3
3
Then he had run into James Dalton by sheer accident one afternoon in Market 3
Street as the governor was swinging out of the Royal Hotel. Georgina had been 3
with him, and an almost instant recognition had heightened the drama of the 3
reunion. Mutual ignorance of one another's progress had bred long explanation 3
and histories, and Clarendon was pleased to find that he had so important an 3
official for a friend. Dalton and Georgina, exchanging many a glance, felt more 3
than a trace of their youthful tenderness; and a friendship was then and there 3
revived which led to frequent calls and a fuller and fuller exchange of 3
confidences. 3
3
3
3

3
3
3
James Dalton learned of his old protege's need for political appointment, and 3
sought, true to his protective role of school and college days, to devise some 3
means of giving 'Little Alf the needed position and scope. He had, it is true, 3
wide appointive powers; but the legislature's constant attacks and 3
encroachments forced him to exercise these with the utmost discretion. At length, 3
however, scarcely three months after the sudden reunion, the foremost 3
institutional medical office in the state fell vacant. Weighing all the elements with 3
care, and conscious that his friend's achievements and reputation would justify 3
the most substantial rewards, the governor felt at last able to act. Formalities 3
were few, and on the eighth of November, 189-, Dr. Alfred Clarendon became 3
medical director of the California State Penitentiary at San Quentin. 3
3
II. 3
3
In scarcely more than a month the hopes of Dr. Clarendon's admirers were 3
amply fulfilled. Sweeping changes in methods brought to the prison's medical 3
routine an efficiency never before dreamed of; and though the subordinates were 3
naturally not without jealousy, they were obliged to admit the magical results of 3
a really great man's superintendence. Then came a time where mere appreciation 3
might well have grown to devour thankfulness at a providential conjunction of 3
time, place, and man; for one morning Dr Jones came to his new chief with a 3
grave face to announce his discovery of a case which he could not but identify as 3
that selfsame black fever whose germ Clarendon had found and classified. 3
3
Dr. Clarendon shewed no surprise, but kept on at the writing before him. 3
3
"I know," he said evenly; "I came across that case yesterday. I'm glad you 3
recognised it. Put the man in a separate ward, though I don't believe this fever is 3
contagious." 3
3
Dr. Jones, with his own opinion of the malady's contagiousness, was glad of this 3
deference to caution; and hastened to execute the order. Upon his return. 3
Clarendon rose to leave, declaring that he would himself take charge of the case 3
alone. Disappointed in his wish to study the great man's methods and technique, 3
the junior physician watched his chief stride away toward the lone ward where 3
he had placed the patient, more critical of the new regime than at any time since 3
admiration had displaced his first jealous pangs. 3
3
Reaching the ward. Clarendon entered hastily, glancing at the bed and stepping 3
back to see how far Dr. Jones's obvious curiosity might have led him. Then, 3
finding the corridor still vacant, he shut the door and turned to examine the 3
sufferer. The man was a convict of a peculiarly repulsive type, and seemed to be 3
racked by the keenest throes of agony. His features were frightfully contracted. 3
3
3
3
1079 3
3
3
3
and his knees drawn sharply up in the mute desperation of the stricken. 3
Clarendon studied him closely, raising his tightly shut eyelids, took his pulse 3
and temperature, and finally dissolving a tablet in water, forced the solution 3
between the sufferer's lips. Before long the height of the attack abated, as shewn 3
by the relaxing body and returning normality of expression, and the patient 3
began to breathe more easily. Then, by a soft rubbing of the ears, the doctor 3
caused the man to open his eyes. There was life in them, for they moved from 3
side to side, though they lacked the fine fire which we are wont to deem the 3
image of the soul. Clarendon smiled as he surveyed the peace his help had 3
brought, feeling behind him the power of an all-capable science. He had long 3
known of this case, and had snatched the victim from death with the work of a 3
moment. Another hour and this man would have gone - yet Jones had seen the 3
symptoms for days before discovering them, and having discovered them, did 3
not know what to do. 3
3
Man's conquest of disease, however, cannot be perfect. Clarendon, assuring the 3
dubious trusty-nurses that the fever was not contagious, had had the patient 3
bathed, sponged in alcohol, and put to bed; but was told the next morning that 3
the case was lost. The man had died after midnight in the most intense agony, 3
and with such cries and distortions of face that the nurses were driven almost to 3
panic. The doctor took this news with his usual calm, whatever his scientific 3
feelings may have been, and ordered the burial of the patient in quicklime. Then, 3
with a philosophic shrug of the shoulders, he made the final rounds of the 3
penitentiary. 3
3
Two days later the prison was hit again. Three men came down at once this time, 3
and there was no concealing the fact that a black fever epidemic was under way. 3
Clarendon, having adhered so firmly to this theory of non-contagiousness, 3
suffered a distinct loss of prestige, and was handicapped by the refusal of the 3
trusty-nurses to attend the patients. Theirs was not the soul-free devotion of 3
those who sacrifice themselves to science and humanity. They were convicts, 3
serving only because of the privileges they could not otherwise buy, and when 3
the price became too great they preferred to resign the privileges. 3
3
But the doctor was still master of the situation. Consulting with the warden and 3
sending urgent messages to his friend the governor, he saw to it that special 3
rewards in cash and in reduced terms were offered to the convicts for the 3
dangerous nursing service; and by this succeeded in getting a very fair quota of 3
volunteers. He was steeled for action now, and nothing could shake his poise 3
and determination. Additional cases brought only a curt nod, and he seemed a 3
stranger to fatigue as he hastened from bedside to bedside all over the vast stone 3
home of sadness and evil. More than forty cases developed within another week, 3
and nurses had to be brought from the city. Clarendon went home very seldom 3
3
3
3
1080 3
3
3
3
at this stage, often sleeping on a cot in the warden's quarters, and always giving 3
himself up with typical abandon to the service of medicine and mankind. Then 3
came the first mutterings of that storm which was soon to convulse San 3
Francisco. News will out, and the menace of black fever spread over the town 3
like a fog from the bay. Reporters trained in the doctrine of 'sensation first' used 3
their imagination without restraint, and gloried when at last they were able to 3
produce a case in the Mexican quarter which a local physician - fonder perhaps 3
of money than of truth or civic welfare - pronounced black fever. 3
3
That was the last straw. Frantic at the thought of the crawling death so close 3
upon them, the people of San Francisco went mad en masse, and embarked upon 3
that historic exodus of which all the country was soon to hear over busy wires. 3
Ferries and rowboats, excursion steamers and launches, railways and cable- cars, 3
bicycles and carriages, moving-vans and work carts, all were pressed into instant 3
and frenzied service. Sausalito and Tamalpais, as lying in the direction of San 3
Quentin, shared in the flight; while housing space in Oakley, Berkeley, and 3
Alameda rose to fabulous prices. Tent colonies sprang up, and improvised 3
villages lined the crowded southward highways from Millbrae to San Jose. Many 3
sought refuge with friends in Sacramento, while the fright-shaken residue forced 3
by various causes to stay behind could do little more than maintain the basic 3
necessities of a nearly dead city. 3
3
Business, save for quack doctors with 'sure cures' and 'preventives' for use 3
against the fever, fell rapidly to the vanishing-point. At first the saloons offered 3
'medicated drinks', but soon found that the populace preferred to be duped by 3
charlatans of more professional aspect. In strangely noiseless streets persons 3
peered into one another's faces to glimpse possible plague symptoms, and 3
shopkeepers began more and more to refuse admission to their clientele, each 3
customer seeming to them a fresh fever menace. Legal and judicial machinery 3
began to disintegrate as attorneys and county clerks succumbed one by one to 3
the urge for flight. Even the doctors deserted in large numbers, many of them 3
pleading the need of vacations among the mountains and the lakes in the 3
northern part of the state. Schools and colleges, theatres and cafA) As, 3
restaurants and saloons, all gradually closed their doors; and in a single week 3
San Francisco lay prostate and inert with only its light, power, and water service 3
even half normal, with newspapers in skeletonic form, and with a crippled 3
parody on transportation maintained by the horse and cable cars. 3
3
This was the lowest ebb. It could not last long, for courage and observation are 3
not altogether dead in mankind; and sooner or later the non-existence of any 3
widespread black fever epidemic outside San Quentin became too obvious a fact 3
to deny, notwithstanding several actual cases and the undeniable spread of 3
typhoid in the unsanitary suburban tent colonies. The leaders and editors of the 3
3
3
3
1081 3
3
3
3
commentary conferred and took action, enlisting in their service the very 3
reporters whose energies had done so much to bring on the trouble, but now 3
turning their 'sensation first' avidity into more constructive channels. Editorials 3
and fictitious interviews appeared, telling of Dr. Clarendon's complete control of 3
the disease, and of the absolute impossibility of its diffusion beyond the prison 3
walls. Reiteration and circulation slowly did their work, and gradually a slim 3
backward trickle of urbanites swelled into a vigorous refluent stream. One of the 3
first healthy symptoms was the start of a newspaper controversy of the approved 3
acrimonious kind, attempting to fix blame for the panic wherever the various 3
participants thought it belonged. The returning doctors, jealously strengthened 3
by their timely vacations, began striking at Clarendon, assuring the public that 3
they as well as he would keep the fever in leash, and censuring him for not doing 3
even more to check its spread within San Quentin. 3
3
Clarendon had, they averred, permitted far more deaths that were necessary. The 3
veriest tyro in medicine knew how to check fever contagion; and if this 3
renowned savant did not do it, it was clearly because he chose for scientific 3
reasons to study the final effects of the disease, rather than to prescribe properly 3
and save the victims. This policy, they insinuated, might be proper enough 3
among convicted murderers in a penal institution, but it would not do in San 3
Francisco, where life was still a precious and sacred thing. Thus they went on, 3
the papers were glad to publish all they wrote, since the sharpness of the 3
campaign, in which Dr. Clarendon would doubtless join, would help to 3
obliterate confusion and restore confidence among the people. 3
3
But Clarendon did not reply. He only smiled, while his singular clinic -man 3
Surama indulged in many a deep, testudinous chuckle. He was at home more 3
nowadays, so that reporters began besieging the gate of the great wall the doctor 3
had built around his house, instead of pestering the warden's office at San 3
Quentin. Results, though, were equally meagre; for Surama formed an 3
impassable barrier between the doctor and the outer world - even after the 3
reporters had got into the grounds. The newspaper men getting access to the 3
front hall had glimpses of Clarendon's singular entourage and made the best 3
they could in a 'write-up' of Surama and the queer skeletonic Thibetans. 3
Exaggeration, of course, occurred in every fresh article, and the net effect of the 3
publicity was distinctly adverse to the great physician. Most persons hate the 3
unusual, and hundreds who could have excused heartlessness or incompetence 3
stood ready to condemn the grotesque taste manifested in the chuckling 3
attendant and the eight black-robed Orientals. 3
3
Early in January an especially persistent young man from the Observer climbed 3
the moated eight-foot brick wall in the rear of the Clarendon grounds and began 3
a survey of the varied outdoor appearances which tree concealed from the front 3
3

3
walk. With quick, alert brain he took in everything - the rose-arbour, the aviaries, 3
the animal cages where all sorts of mammalia from monkeys to guinea-pigs 3
might be seen and heard, the stout wooden clinic building with barred windows 3
in the northwest corner of the yard - and bent searching glances throughout the 3
thousand square feet of intramural privacy. A great article was brewing, and he 3
would have escaped unscathed but for the barking of Dick, Georgina 3
Clarendon's gigantic and beloved St. Bernard. Surama, instant in his response, 3
had the youth by the collar before a protest could be uttered, and was presently 3
shaking him as a terrier shakes a rat, and dragging him through the trees to the 3
front yard and the gate. 3
3
Breathless explanations and quavering demands to see Dr. Clarendon were 3
useless. Surama only chuckled and dragged his victim on. Suddenly a positive 3
fright crept over the dapper scribe, and he began to wish desperately that this 3
unearthly creature would speak, if only to prove that he really was a being of 3
honest flesh and blood belonging to this planet. He became deathly sick, and 3
strove not to glimpse the eyes which he knew must lie at the base of those gaping 3
black sockets. Soon he heard the gate open and felt himself propelled violently 3
through; in another moment waking rudely to the things of earth as he landed 3
wetly and muddily in the ditch which Clarendon had had dug around the entire 3
length of the wall. Fright gave a place to rage as he heard the massive gate slam 3
shut, and he rose dripping to shake his fist at the forbidding portal. Then, as he 3
turned to go, a soft sound grated behind him, and through a small wicket in the 3
gate he felt the sunken eyes of Surama and heard the echoes of a deep-voiced, 3
blood- freezing chuckle. 3
3
This young man, feeling perhaps justly that his handling had been rougher than 3
he deserved, resolved to revenge himself upon the household responsible for his 3
treatment. Accordingly he prepared a fictitious interview with Dr. Clarendon, 3
supposed to be held in the clinic building, during which he was careful to 3
describe the agonies of a dozen black fever patients whom his imagination 3
arranged on orderly rows of couches. His master-stroke was the picture of one 3
especially pathetic sufferer gasping for water, while the doctor held a glass of the 3
sparkling fluid just out of his reach, in a scientific attempt to determine the effect 3
of a tantalising emotion on the course of the disease. This invention was followed 3
by paragraphs of insinuating comment so outwardly respectful that it bore a 3
double venom. Dr. Clarendon was, the article ran, undoubtedly the greatest and 3
most single-minded scientist in the world; but science is no friend to individual 3
welfare, and one would not like to have one's gravest ills drawn out and 3
aggravated merely to satisfy an investigator on some point of abstract truth. Life 3
is too short for that. 3
3
3
3
1083 3
3
3
3
Altogether, the article was diabolically skilful, and succeeded in horrifying nine 3
readers out of ten against Dr. Clarendon and his supposed methods. Other 3
papers were quick to copy and enlarge upon its substance, taking the cue it 3
offered, and commencing a series of 'faked' interviews which fairly ran the 3
gamut of derogatory fantasy. In no case, however, did the doctor condescend to 3
offer a contradiction. He had no time to waste on fools and liars, and cared little 3
for the esteem of a thoughtless rabble he despised. When James Dalton 3
telegraphed his regrets and offered aid. Clarendon replied with an almost 3
boorish curtness. He did not heed the barking of dogs, and could not bother to 3
muzzle them. Nor would he thank anyone for messing with a matter wholly 3
beneath notice. Silent and contemptuous, he continued his duties with tranquil 3
evenness. 3
3
But the young reporter's spark had done its work. San Francisco was insane 3
again, and this time as much with rage as with fear. Sober judgment became a 3
lost art; and though no second exodus occurred, there ensued a reign of vice and 3
recklessness born of desperation, and suggesting parallel phenomena in 3
mediaeval times of pestilence. Hatred ran riot against the man who had found 3
the disease and was struggling to restrain it, and a light-headed public forgot his 3
great services to knowledge in their efforts to fan the flames of resentment. They 3
seemed, in their blindness, to hate him in person, rather than the plague which 3
had come to their breeze-cleaned and usually healthy city. 3
3
Then the young reporter, playing in the Neronic fire he had kindled, added a 3
crowning personal touch of his own. Remembering the indignities he had 3
suffered at the hands of the cadaverous clinic-man, he prepared a masterly article 3
on the home and environment of Dr. Clarendon, giving especial prominence to 3
Surama, whose very aspect he declared sufficient to scare the healthiest person 3
into any sort of fever. He tried to make the gaunt chuckler appear equally 3
ridiculous and terrible, succeeding best, perhaps, in the latter half of his 3
intention, since a tide of horror always welled up whenever he thought of his 3
brief proximity to the creature. He collected all the rumours current about the 3
man, elaborated on the unholy depth of his reputed scholarship, and hinted 3
darkly that it could have been no godly realm of secret and aeon-weighed Africa 3
wherein Dr. Clarendon had found him. 3
3
Georgina, who followed the papers closely, felt crushed and hurt by these attacks 3
upon her brother, but James Dalton, who called often at the house, did his best to 3
comfort her. In this he was warm and sincere; for he wished not only to console 3
the woman he loved, but to utter some measure of the reverence he had always 3
felt for the starward-bound genius who had been his youth's closest comrade. He 3
told Georgina how greatness can never be exempted from the shafts of envy, and 3
3
3
3
1084 3
3
3
3
cited the long, sad list of splendid brains crushed beneath vulgar heels. The 3
attacks, he pointed out, formed the truest of all proofs of Alfred's solid eminence. 3
3
"But they hurt just the same," she replied, "and all the more because I know that 3
Al really suffers from them, no matter how indifferent he tries to be." 3
3
Dalton kissed her hand in a manner not then obsolete among well-born persona. 3
3
"And it hurts me a thousand times more, knowing that it hurts you and Alf. But 3
never mind, Georgie, we'll stand together and pull through it!" 3
3
Thus it came about that Georgina came more and more to rely on the strength of 3
the steel-firm, square- jawed governor who had been her youthful swain, and 3
more and more to confide in him the things she feared. The press attacks and the 3
epidemic were not quite all. There were aspects of the household which she did 3
not like. Surama, cruel in equal measure to man and beast, filled her with the 3
most unnamable repulsion; and she could not help but feel he meant some 3
vague, indefinable harm to Alfred. She did not like the Thibetans, either, and 3
thought it very peculiar that Surama was able to talk with them. Alfred would 3
not tell her who or what Surama was, but had once explained rather haltingly 3
that he was a much older man that he was a much older man than would be 3
commonly thought credible, and that he had mastered secrets and been through 3
experiences calculated to make him a colleague of phenomenal value for any 3
scientist seeking Nature's hidden mysteries. 3
3
Urged by her uneasiness, Dalton became a still more frequent visitor at the 3
Clarendon home, though he saw that his presence was deeply resented by 3
Surama. The bony clinic-man formed the habit of glaring peculiarly from those 3
spectral sockets when admitting him, and would often, after closing the gate 3
when he left, chuckle monotonously in a manner that made his flesh creep. 3
Meanwhile Dr. Clarendon seemed oblivious of everything save his work at San 3
Quentin, whither he went each day in his launch - alone save for Surama, who 3
managed the wheel while the doctor read or collated his notes. Dalton welcomed 3
these regular absences, for they gave him constant opportunities to renew his 3
suit for Georgina's hand. When he would overstay and meet Alfred, however, 3
the latter's greeting was always friendly despite his habitual reserve. In time the 3
engagement of James and Georgina grew to be a definite thing, and the two 3
awaited only a favourable time to speak to Alfred. 3
3
The governor, whole-souled in everything and firm in his protective loyalty, 3
spared no pains in spreading propaganda on his old friend's behalf. Press and 3
officialdom both felt his influence, and he even succeeded in interesting scientists 3
in the East, many of whom came to California to study the plague and 3
3
3
3
1085 3
3
3
3
investigate the anti-fever bacillus which Clarendon was so rapidly isolating and 3
perfecting. These doctors and biologists, however, did not obtain the information 3
they wished; so that several of them left with a very unfortunate impression. Not 3
a few prepared articles hostile to Clarendon, accusing him of an unscientific and 3
fame-seeking attitude, and intimating that he concealed his methods through a 3
highly unprofessional desire for ultimate personal profit. 3
3
Others, fortunately, were more liberal in their judgments, and wrote 3
enthusiastically of Clarendon and his work. They had seen the patients, and 3
could appreciate how marvellously he held the dread disease in leash. His 3
secrecy regarding the antitoxin they deemed quite justifiable, since its public 3
diffusion in unperfected form could not but do more harm than good. Clarendon 3
himself, whom many of their number had met before, impressed them more 3
profoundly than ever, and they did not hesitate to compare him with Jenner, 3
Lister, Koch, Pasteur, Metchnikoff, and the rest of those whose whole lives have 3
served pathology and humanity. Dalton was careful to save for Alfred all the 3
magazines that spoke well of him, bringing them in person as an excuse to see 3
Georgina. They did not, however, produce much effect save a contemptuous 3
smile; and Clarendon would generally throw them to Surama, whose deep, 3
disturbing chuckle upon reading formed a close parallel to the doctor's own 3
ironic amusement. 3
3
One Monday evening early in February Dalton called with the definite 3
impression asking Clarendon for his sister's hand. Georgina herself admitted 3
him to the grounds, and as they walked toward the house he stopped to pat the 3
great dog which rushed up and laid friendly fore paws on his breast. It was Dick, 3
Georgina's cherished St. Bernard, and Dalton was glad to feel that he had the 3
affection of a creature which meant so much to her. 3
3
Dick was excited and glad, and turned the governor nearly half about with his 3
vigorous pressure as he gave a soft quick bark and sprang off through the trees 3
toward the clinic. He did not vanish, though, but presently stopped and looked 3
back, softly barking again as if he wished Dalton to follow. Georgina, fond of 3
obeying her huge pet's playful whims, motioned to James to see what he wanted; 3
and they both walked slowly after him as he trotted relievedly to the rear of the 3
yard where the top of the clinic building stood silhouetted against the stars 3
above the great brick wall. 3
3
The outline of lights within shewed around the edges of the dark window- 3
curtains, so they knew that Alfred and Surama were at work. Suddenly from the 3
interior came a thin, subdued sound like the cry of a child - a plaintive call of 3
'Mamma! Mamma!' at which Dick barked, while James and Georgina started 3
perceptibly. Then Georgina smiled, remembering the parrots that Clarendon 3
3
3
3
1086 3
3
3
3
always kept for experimental uses, and patted Dick on the head either to forgive 3
him for having fooled her and Dalton, or to console him for having been fooled 3
himself. 3
3
As they turned toward the house Dalton mentioned his resolve to speak to 3
Alfred that evening about their engagement, and Georgina supplied no 3
objection. She knew that her brother would not relish the loss of a faithful 3
manager and companion, but believed his affection would place no barrier in the 3
way of her happiness. 3
3
Later that evening Clarendon came into the house with a springy step and aspect 3
less grim than usual. Dalton, seeing a good omen in this easy buoyancy, took 3
heart as the doctor wrung his hand with a jovial "Ah, Jimmy, how's politics this 3
year?" He glanced at Georgina, and she quietly excused herself, while the two 3
men settled down to a chat on general subjects. Little by little, amidst many 3
reminders of their old youthful days, Dalton worked toward his point; till at last 3
he came out plainly with the crucial inquiry. 3
3
" Alf, I want to marry Georgina. Have we your blessing?" 3
3
Keenly watching his old friend, Dalton saw a shadow steal over his face. The 3
dark eyes flashed for a moment, then veiled themselves as wonted placidity 3
returned. So science or selfishness was at work after all! 3
3
"You're asking an impossibility, James. Georgina isn't the aimless butterfly she 3
was years ago. She has a place in the service of truth and mankind now, and that 3
place is here. She's decided to devote her life to my work - or the household that 3
makes my work possible - and there's no room for desertion or personal 3
caprice." 3
3
Dalton waited to see if had finished. The same old fanaticism - humanity versus 3
the individual - and the doctor was going to let it spoil his sister's life! Then he 3
tried to answer. 3
3
"But look here, Alf, do you mean to say that Georgina, in particular, is so 3
necessary to your work that you must make a slave and martyr out of her? Use 3
your sense of proportion, man! If it were a question of Surama or somebody in 3
the utter thick of your experiments it might be different; but, after all, Georgina is 3
only a housekeeper to you in the last analysis. She has promised to be my wife 3
and says that she loves me. Have you the right to cut her off from the life that 3
belongs to her? Have you the right - " 3
3
3
3
1087 3
3
3
3
"That'll do, James!" Clarendon's face was set and white. "Whether or not I have 3
the right to govern my own family is no business of an outsider." 3
3
"Outsider - you can say that to a man who - " Dalton almost choked as the steely 3
voice of the doctor interrupted him again. 3
3
"An outsider to my family, and from now on an outsider to my home. Dalton, 3
your presumption goes just a little too far! Good evening. Governor!" 3
3
And Clarendon strode from the room without extending his hand. 3
3
Dalton hesitated for a moment, almost at a loss what to do, when presently 3
Georgina entered. Her face shewed that she had spoken with her brother, and 3
Dalton took both her hands impetuously. 3
3
"Well, Georgie, what do you say? I'm afraid it's a choice between Alf and me. 3
You know how I feel - you know how I felt before when it was your father I was 3
up against. What's your answer this time?" 3
3
He paused as she responded slowly. 3
3
"James, dear, do you believe that I love you?" 3
3
He nodded and pressed her hands expectantly. 3
3
"Then, if you love me, you'll wait a while. Don't think of Al's rudeness. He's to 3
be pitied. I can't tell you the whole thing now, but you know how worried I am - 3
what with the strain of his work, the criticism, and the staring and cackling of 3
that horrible creature Surama! I'm afraid he'll break down - he shews the strain 3
more than anyone outside the family could tell. I can see it, for I've watched him 3
all my life. He's changing - slowly bending under his burdens - and he puts on 3
his extra brusqueness to hide it. You can see what I mean, can't you, dear?" 3
3
She paused, and Dalton nodded again, pressing one of her hands to his breast. 3
Then she concluded. 3
3
"So promise me, dear, to be patient. I must stand by him; I must! I must!" 3
3
Dalton did not speak for a while, but his head inclined in what was almost a bow 3
of reverence. There was more of Christ in this devoted woman than he had 3
thought any human being possessed, and in the face of such love and loyalty he 3
could do no urging. 3
3
3
3
1088 3
3
3
3
Words of sadness and parting were brief; and James, whose blue eyes were 3
misty, scarcely saw the gaunt clinic -man as the gate to the street was at last 3
opened to him. But when it slammed to behind him he heard that blood-curdling 3
chuckle he had come to recognize so well, and knew that Surama was there - 3
Surama, whom Georgina had called her brother's evil genius. Walking away 3
with a firm step, Dalton resolved to be watchful, and to act at the first sign of 3
trouble. 3
3
III. 3
3
Meanwhile San Francisco, the epidemic still on the lips of all, seethed with anti- 3
Clarendon feeling. Actually the cases outside the penitentiary were very few, and 3
confined almost wholly to the lower Mexican element whose lack of sanitation 3
was a standing invitation to disease of every kind; but politicians and the people 3
needed no more than this to confirm the attacks made by the doctor's enemies. 3
Seeing that Dalton was immovable in his championship of Clarendon, the 3
malcontents, medical dogmatists, and wardheelers turned their attention to the 3
state legislature; lining up the anti-Clarendonists and the governor's old enemies 3
with great shrewdness, and preparing to launch a law - with a veto-proof 3
majority - transferring the authority for minor institutional appointments from 3
the chief executive to the various boards or commissions concerned. 3
3
In the furtherance of this measure no lobbyist was more active than Clarendon's 3
chief successor. Dr. Jones. Jealous of his superior from the first, he now saw an 3
opportunity for turning matters to his liking; and he thanked fate for the 3
circumstance - responsible indeed for his present position - of his relationship to 3
the chairman of the prison board. The new law, if passed, would certainly mean 3
the removal of Clarendon and the appointment of himself in his stead; so, 3
mindful of his own interest, he worked hard for it. Jones was all that Clarendon 3
was not - a natural politician and sycophantic opportunist who served his own 3
advancement first and science only incidentally. He was poor, and avid for 3
salaried position, quite in contrast to the wealthy and independent savant he 3
sought to displace. So with a rat-like cunning and persistence he laboured to 3
undermine the great biologist above him, and was one day rewarded by the 3
news that the new law was passed. Thenceforward the governor was powerless 3
to make appointments to the state institutions, and the medical dictatorship of 3
San Quentin lay at the disposal of the prison board. 3
3
Of all this legislative turmoil Clarendon was singularly oblivious. Wrapped 3
wholly in matters of administration and research, he was blind to the treason of 3
'that ass Jones' who worked by his side, and deaf to all the gossip of the 3
warden's office. He had never in his life read the newspapers, and the 3
banishment of Dalton from his home cut off his last real link with the world of 3
3
3
3
1089 3
3
3
3
outside events. With the naivetA) A of a recluse, he at no time thought of his 3
position as insecure. In view of Dalton's loyalty, and of his forgiveness of even 3
the greatest wrongs, as shewn in his dealings with the elder Clarendon who had 3
crushed his father to death on the stock exchange, the possibility of a 3
gubernatorial dismissal was, of course, out of the question; nor could the doctor's 3
political ignorance envisage a sudden shift of power which might place the 3
matter of retention or dismissal in very different hands. Thereupon he merely 3
smiled with satisfaction when Dalton left for Sacramento; convinced that his 3
place in San Quentin and his sister's place in his household were alike secure 3
from disturbance. He was accustomed to having what he wanted, and fancied 3
his luck was still holding out. 3
3
The first week in March, a day or so after the enactment of the new law, the 3
chairman of the prison board called at San Quentin. Clarendon was out, but Dr. 3
Jones was glad to shew the august visitor - his own uncle, incidentally - through 3
the great infirmary, including the fever ward made so famous by press and 3
panic. By this time converted against his will to Clarendon's belief in the fever's 3
non-contagiousness, Jones smilingly assured his uncle that nothing was to be 3
feared, and encouraged him to inspect the patients in detail - especially a ghastly 3
skeleton, once a very giant of bulk and vigour, who was, he insinuated, slowly 3
and painfully dying because Clarendon would not administer the proper 3
medicine. 3
3
"Do you mean to say," cried the chairman, "that Dr. Clarendon refuses to let the 3
man have what he needs, knowing his life could be saved?" 3
3
"Just that," snapped Dr. Jones, pausing as the door opened to admit none other 3
than Clarendon himself. Clarendon nodded coldly to Jones and surveyed the 3
visitor, whom he did not know, with disapproval. 3
3
"Dr. Jones, I thought you knew this case was not to be disturbed at all. And 3
haven't I said that visitors aren't to be admitted except by special permission?" 3
3
But the chairman interrupted before his nephew could introduce him. 3
3
"Pardon me. Dr. Clarendon, but am I to understand that you refuse to give this 3
man the medicine that would save him?" 3
3
Clarendon glared coldly, and rejoined with steel in his voice, 3
3
"That's an impertinent question, sir. I am in authority here, and visitors are not 3
allowed. Please leave the room at once." 3
3
3
3
1090 3
3
3
3
The chairman, his sense of drama secretly tickled, answered with greater pomp 3
and hauteur than were necessary. 3
3
"You mistake me, sir! I, not you, am master here. You are addressing the 3
chairman of the prison board. I must say, however, that I deem your activity a 3
menace to the welfare of the prisoners, and must request your resignation. 3
Henceforth Dr. Jones will be in charge, and if you choose to remain until your 3
formal dismissal you will take your orders from him." 3
3
It was Wilfred Jones's great moment. Life never gave him another such climax, 3
and we need not grudge him this one. After all, he was a small rather than a bad 3
man, and he had only obeyed a small man's code of looking to himself at all 3
costs. Clarendon stood still, gazing at the speaker as if he thought him mad, till 3
in another second the look of triumph on Dr. Jones's face convinced him that 3
something important was indeed afoot. He was icily courteous as he replied. 3
3
"No doubt you are what you claim to be, sir. But fortunately my appointment 3
came from the governor of the state, and can therefore be revoked only by him." 3
3
The chairman and his nephew both stared perplexedly, for they had not realized 3
to what lengths unworldly ignorance can go. Then the older man, grasping the 3
situation, explained at some length. 3
3
"Had I found that the current reports did you an injustice," he concluded, "I 3
would have deferred action; but the case of this poor man and your own 3
arrogant manner left me no choice. As it is - " 3
3
But Dr. Clarendon interrupted with a new razor-sharpness in his voice. 3
3
"As it is, I am the director in charge at present, and I ask you to leave this room 3
at once." 3
3
The chairman reddened and exploded. 3
3
"Look here, sir, who do you think you're talking to? I'll have you chucked out of 3
here - damn your impertinence!" 3
3
But he had time only to finish the sentence. Transferred by the insult to a sudden 3
dynamo of hate, the slender scientist launched out with both fists in a burst of 3
preternatural strength of which no one would have thought him capable. And if 3
his strength was preternatural, his accuracy of aim was no less so; for not even a 3
champion of the ring could have wrought a neater result. Both men - the 3
chairman and Dr. Jones - were squarely hit; the one full in the face and the other 3
on the point of the chin. Going down like felled trees, they lay motionless and 3
3
3
3
1091 3
3
3
3
unconscious on the floor; while Clarendon, now clear and completely master of 3
himself, took his hat and cane and went out to join Surama in the launch. Only 3
when seated in the moving boat did he at last give audible vent to the frightful 3
rage that consumed him. Then, with face convulsed, he called down 3
imprecations from the stars and the gulfs beyond the stars; so that even Surama 3
shuddered, made an elder sign that no book of history records, and forgot to 3
chuckle. 3
3
IV. 3
3
Georgina soothed her brother's hurt as best she could. He had come home 3
mentally and physically exhausted and thrown himself on the library lounge; 3
and in that gloomy room, little by little, the faithful sister had taken in the almost 3
incredible news. Her consolations were instantaneous and tender, and she made 3
him realise how vast, though unconscious, a tribute to his greatness the attacks, 3
persecution, and dismissal all were. He had tried to cultivate the indifference she 3
preached, and could have done so had personal dignity alone been involved. But 3
the loss of scientific opportunity was more than he could calmly bear, and he 3
sighed again and again as he repeated how three months more of study in the 3
prison might have given him at last the long-sought bacillus which would make 3
all fever a thing of the past. 3
3
Then Georgina tried another mode of cheering, and told him that surely the 3
prison board would send for him again if the fever did not abate, or if it broke 3
out with increased force. But even this was ineffective, and Clarendon answered 3
only in a string of bitter, ironic, and half-meaningless little sentences whose tone 3
shewed all too clearly how deeply despair and resentment had bitten. 3
3
"Abate? Break out again? Oh, it'll abate all right! At least, they'll think it has 3
abated. They'd think anything, no matter what happens! Ignorant eyes see 3
nothing, and bunglers are never discovered. Science never shews her face to that 3
sort. And they call themselves doctors! Best of all, fancy that ass Jones in charge!" 3
3
Coming with a quick sneer, he laughed so daemonically that Georgina shivered. 3
3
The days that followed were dismal ones indeed at the Clarendon mansion. 3
Depression, stark and unrelieved, had taken hold of the doctor's usually tireless 3
mind; and he would even have refused food had not Georgina forced it upon 3
him. His great notebook of observations lay unopened on the library table, and 3
his little gold syringe of anti-fever serum - a clever device of his own, with a self- 3
contained reservoir, attached to a broad gold ring, and single-pressure action 3
peculiar to itself - rested idly in a small leather case beside it. Vigour, ambition, 3
and the desire for stuffy and observation seemed to have died within him; and 3
3
3
3
1092 3
3
3
3
he made no inquiries about his chnic, where hundreds of germ cultures stood in 3
their orderly phials awaiting his attention. 3
3
The countless animals held for experiments played, lively and well fed, in the 3
early spring sunshine; and as Georgina strolled out through the rose-arbour to 3
the cages she felt a strangely incongruous sense of happiness about her. She 3
knew, though, how tragically transient that happiness must be; since the start of 3
new work would soon make all these small creatures unwilling martyrs to 3
science. Knowing this, she glimpsed a sort of compensating element in her 3
brother's inaction, and encouraged him to keep on in a rest he needed so badly. 3
The eight Thibetan servants moved noiselessly about, each as impeccable 3
effective as usual; and Georgina saw to it that the order of the household did not 3
suffer because of the master's relaxation. 3
3
Study and starward ambition laid aside in slippered and dressing-gowned 3
indifference. Clarendon was content to let Georgina treat him as an infant. He 3
met her maternal fussiness with a slow, sad smile, and always obeyed her 3
multitude of orders and precepts. A kind of faint, wistful felicity came over the 3
languid household, amidst which the only dissenting note was supplied by 3
Surama. He indeed was miserable, and looked often with sullen and resentful 3
eyes at the sunny serenity in Georgina's face. His only joy had been the turmoil 3
of experiment, and he missed the routine of seizing the fated animals, bearing 3
them to the clinic in clutching talons, and watching them with hot brooding gaze 3
and evil chuckles as they gradually fell into the final coma with wide-opened, 3
red-rimmed eyes, and swollen tongue lolling from froth-covered mouth. 3
3
Now he was seemingly driven to desperation by the sight of the carefree 3
creatures in their cages, and frequently came to ask Clarendon if there were any 3
orders. Finding the doctor apathetic and unwilling to begin work, he would go 3
away muttering under his breath and glaring curses upon everything; stealing 3
with cat-like tread to his own quarters in the basement, where his voice would 3
sometimes ascend in deep, muffled rhythms of blasphemous strangeness and 3
uncomfortable ritualistic suggestion. 3
3
All this wore on Georgina's nerves, but not by any means so gravely as her 3
brother's continued lassitude itself. The duration of the state alarmed her, and 3
little by little she lost the air of cheerfulness which had so provoked the clinic- 3
man. Herself skilled in medicine, she found the doctor's condition highly 3
unsatisfactory from an alienist's point of view; and she now feared as much from 3
his absence of interest and activity as she had formerly feared from his fanatical 3
zeal and overstudy. Was lingering melancholy about to turn the once brilliant 3
man of intellect into an innocuous imbecile? 3
3
3
3
1093 3
3
3
3
Then, toward the end of May, came the sudden change. Georgina always 3
recalled the smallest details connected with it; details as trivial as the box 3
delivered to Surama the day before, postmarked Algiers, and emitting a most 3
unpleasant odour; and the sharp, sudden thunderstorm, rare in the extreme for 3
California, which sprang up that night as Surama chanted his rituals behind his 3
locked basement door in a droning chest-voice louder and more intense than 3
usual. 3
3
It was a sunny day, and she had been in the garden gathering flowers for the 3
dining-room. Re-entering the house, she glimpsed her bother in the library, fully 3
dressed and seated at the table, alternately consulting the notes in his thick 3
observation book, and making fresh entries with brisk assured strokes of the pen. 3
He was alert and vital, and there was a satisfying resilience about his movements 3
as he now and then turned a page, or reached for a book from the rear of the 3
great table. Delighted and relieved, Georgina hastened to deposit her flowers in 3
the dining-room and returned; but when she reached the library again she found 3
that her brother was gone. 3
3
She knew, of course, that he must be in the clinic at work, and rejoiced to think 3
that his old mind and purpose had snapped back into place. Realizing it would 3
be of no use to delay the luncheon for him, she at alone and set aside a bite to be 3
kept warm in case of his return at an odd moment. But he did not come. He was 3
making up for lost time, and was still in the great stout-planked clinic when she 3
went for a stroll through the rose-arbour. 3
3
As she walked among the fragrant blossoms she saw Surama fetching animals 3
for the test. She wished she could notice him less, for he always made her 3
shudder; but her very dread had sharpened her eyes and ears where he was 3
concerned. He always went hatless around the yard, and total hairlessness of his 3
head enhanced his skeleton-like aspect horribly. Now she heard a faint chuckle 3
as he took a small monkey from its cage against the wall and carried it to the 3
clinic, his long, bony fingers pressing so cruelly into its furry sides that it cried 3
out in frightened anguish. The sight sickened her, and brought her walk to an 3
end. Her inmost soul rebelled at the ascendancy this creature had gained over 3
her brother, and she reflected bitterly that the two had almost changed places as 3
master and servant. 3
3
Night came without Clarendon's return to the house, and Georgina concluded 3
that he was absorbed in one of his very longest sessions, which meant total 3
disregard of time. She hated to retire without a talk with him about his sudden 3
recovery; but finally, feeling it would be futile to wait up, she wrote a cheerful 3
note and propped it before his chair on the library table; then started resolutely 3
for bed. 3
3
3
3
1094 3
3
3
3
She was not quite asleep when she heard the outer door open and shut. So it had 3
not been an all night session after all! Determined to see that her brother had a 3
meal before retiring she rose, slipped on a robe, and descended to the library, 3
halting only when she heard voices from behind the half-opened door. 3
Clarendon and Surama were talking, and she waited till the clinic-man might go. 3
3
Surama, however, shewed no inclination to depart; and indeed, the whole heated 3
tenor of the discourse seemed to bespeak absorption and promise length. 3
Georgina, though she had not meant to listen, could not help catching a phrase 3
now and then, and presently became aware of a sinister undercurrent which 3
frightened her very much without being wholly clear to her. Her brother's voice, 3
nervous, incisive, held her notice with disquieting persistence. 3
3
"But anyway," he was saying, "we haven't enough animals for another day, and 3
you know how hard it is to get a decent supply at short notice. It seems silly to 3
waste so much effort on comparative trash when human specimens could be had 3
with just a little extra care." 3
3
Georgina sickened at the possible implication, and caught at the hall rack to 3
steady herself. Surama was replying in that deep, hollow tone which seemed tOo 3
echo with the evil of a thousand ages and a thousand planets. 3
3
"Steady, steady - what a child you are with your haste and impatience! You 3
crowd things so! When you've lived as I have, so that a whole life will seem only 3
an hour, you won't be so fretful about a day or week or month! You work too 3
fast. You've plenty of specimens in the cages for a full week if you'll only go at a 3
sensible rate. You might even begin on the older material if you'd be sure not to 3
overdo it." 3
3
"Never mind my haste!" the reply was snapped out sharply. "I have my own 3
methods. I don't want to use our material if I can help it, for I prefer them as they 3
are. And you'd better be careful of them anyway - you know the knives some of 3
those sly dogs carry." 3
3
Surama's deep chuckle came. 3
3
"Don't worry about that. The brutes eat, don't they? Well, I can get you one any 3
time you need it. But go slow - with the boy gone, there are only eight, and now 3
that you've lost San Quentin it'll be hard to get new ones by the wholesale. I'd 3
advise you to start in on Tsanpo - he's the least use to you as he is, and - " 3
3
But that was all Georgina heard. Transfixed by a hideous dread from the 3
thoughts this talk excited, she nearly sank to the floor where she stood, and was 3
3
3
3
1095 3
3
3
3
scarcely able to drag herself up the stairs and into her room. What was the evil 3
monster Surama planning? Into what was he guiding her brother? What 3
monstrous circumstances lay behind these cryptic sentences? A thousand 3
phantoms of darkness and menace danced before her eyes, and she flung herself 3
upon the bed without hope of sleep. One thought above the rest stood out with 3
fiendish prominence, and she almost screamed aloud as it beat itself into her 3
brain with renewed force. Then Nature, kinder than she expected, intervened at 3
last. Closing her eyes in a dead faint, she did not awake till morning, nor did any 3
fresh nightmare come to join the lasting one which the overheard words had 3
brought. 3
3
With the morning sunshine came a lessening of the tension. What happens in the 3
night when one is tired often reaches the consciousness in distorted forms, and 3
Georgina could see that her brain must have given strange colour to scraps of 3
common medical conversation. To suppose her brother - only son of the gentle 3
Frances Schuyler Clarendon - guilty of strange sacrifices in the name of science 3
would be to do an injustice to their blood, and she decided to omit all mention of 3
her trip downstairs, lest Alfred ridicule her fantastic notions. 3
3
When she reached the breakfast table she found that Clarendon was already 3
gone, and regretted that not even this second morning had given her a chance to 3
congratulate him on his revived activity. Quietly taking the breakfast served by 3
stone-deaf old Margarita, the Mexican cook, she read the morning paper and 3
seated herself with some needlework by the sitting-room window overlooking 3
the great yard. All was silent out there, and she could see that the last of the 3
animal cages had been emptied. Science was served, and the lime-pit held all that 3
was left of the once pretty and lively little creatures. This slaughter had always 3
grieved her, but she had never complained, since she knew it was all for 3
humanity. Being a scientist's sister, she used to say to herself, was like being the 3
sister of a soldier who kills to save his countrymen from their foes. 3
3
After luncheon Georgina resumed her post by the window, and had been busy 3
sewing for some time when the sound of a pistol shot from the yard caused her 3
to look out in alarm. There, not far from the clinic, she saw the ghastly form of 3
Surama, a revolver in his hand, and his skull-face twisted into a strange 3
expression as he chuckled at a cowering figure robed in black silk and carrying a 3
long Thibetan knife. It was the servant Tsanpo, and as she recognised the 3
shrivelled face Georgina remembered horribly what she had overheard the night 3
before. The sun flashed on the polished blade, and suddenly Surama's revolver 3
spat once more. This time the knife flew from the Mongol's hand, and Surama 3
glanced greedily at his shaking and bewildered prey. 3
3
3
3
1096 3
3
3
3
Then Tsanpo, glancing quickly at his unhurt hand and at the fallen knife, sprang 3
nimbly away from the stealthily approaching clinic-man and made a dash for the 3
house. Surama, however, was too swift for him, and caught him in a single leap, 3
seizing his shoulder and almost crushing him. For a moment the Thibetan tried 3
to struggle, but Surama lifted him like an animal by the scruff of the neck and 3
bore him off toward the clinic. Georgina heard him chuckling and taunting the 3
man in his own tongue, and saw the yellow face of the victim twist and quiver 3
with fright. Suddenly realising against her own will what was taking place, a 3
great horror mastered her and she fainted for the second time within twenty-four 3
hours. 3
3
When consciousness returned, the golden light of late afternoon was flooding the 3
room. Georgina, picking up her fallen work-basket and scattered materials, was 3
lost in a daze of doubts; but finally felt convinced that the scene which had 3
overcome her must have been all too tragically real. Her first fears, then, were 3
horrible truths. What to do about it, nothing in her experience could tell her; and 3
she was vaguely thankful that her brother did not appear. She must talk to him, 3
but not now. She could not talk to anybody now. And, thinking shudderingly of 3
the monstrous happening behind those barred clinic windows, she crept into bed 3
for a long night of anguished sleeplessness. 3
3
Rising haggardly on the following day, Georgina saw the doctor for the first time 3
since his recovery. He was bustling about preoccupiedly, circulating between the 3
house and the clinic, and paying little attention to anything besides his work. 3
There was no chance for the dreaded interview, and Clarendon did not even 3
notice his sister's worn-out aspect and hesitant manner. 3
3
In the evening she heard him in the library, talking to himself in a fashion most 3
unusual for him, and she felt that he was under a great strain which might 3
culminate in the return of his apathy. Entering the room, she tried to clam him 3
without referring to any trying subject, and forced a steadying cup of bouillon 3
upon him. Finally she asked gently what was distressing him, and waited 3
anxiously for his reply, hoping to hear that Surama's treatment of the poor 3
Thibetan had horrified and outraged him. 3
3
There was a note of fretfulness in his voice as he responded. 3
3
"What's distressing me? Good God, Georgina, what isn't? Look at the cages and 3
see if you have to ask again! Cleaned out - milked dry - not a cursed specimen 3
left; and a line of the most important bacterial cultures incubating in their tubes 3
without a chance to do an ounce of good! Days' work wasted - whole 3
programme set back - it's enough to drive a man mad! How shall I ever get 3
anywhere if I can't scrape up some decent subjects?" 3
3
3
3
1097 3
3
3
3
Georgina stroked his forehead. 3
3
"I think you ought to rest a while, Al dear." 3
3
He moved away. 3
3
"Rest? That's good! That's damn good! What else have I been doing but resting 3
and vegetating and staring blankly into space for the last fifty or a hundred or a 3
thousand years? Just as I manage to shake off the clouds, I have to run short of 3
material - and then I'm told to lapse back again into drooling stupefaction! God! 3
And all the while some sneaking thief is probably working with my data and 3
getting ready to come out ahead of me with the credit for my own work. I'll lose 3
by a neck - some fool with the proper specimens will get the prize, when one 3
week more with even half-adequate facilities would see me through with flying 3
colours!" 3
3
His voice rose querulously, and there was an overtone of mental strain which 3
Georgina did not like. She answered softly, yet not so softly as to hint at the 3
soothing of a psychopathic case. 3
3
"But you're killing yourself with this worry and tension, and if you're dead, how 3
can you do your work?" 3
3
He gave a smile that was almost a sneer. 3
3
"I guess a week or a month - all the time I need - wouldn't quite finish me, and it 3
doesn't much matter what becomes of me or any other individual in the end. 3
Science is what must be served - science - the austere cause of human knowledge. 3
I'm like the monkeys and birds and guinea pigs I use - just a cog in the machine, 3
to be used to the advantage of the whole. They had to be killed - 1 may have to be 3
killed - what of it? Isn't the cause we serve worth that and more?" 3
3
Georgina sighed. For a moment she wondered whether, after all, this ceaseless 3
round of slaughter really was worthwhile. 3
3
"But are you absolutely sure your discovery will be enough of a boon to 3
humanity to warrant these sacrifices?" 3
3
Clarendon's eyes flashed dangerously. 3
3
"Humanity! What the deuce is humanity? Science! Dolts! Just individuals over 3
and over again! Humanity is made for preachers to whom it means the blindly 3
credulous. Humanity is made for the predatory rich to whom it speaks in terms 3
of dollars and cents. Humanity is made for the politician to whom it signifies 3
3
3
3
1098 3
3
3
3
collective power to be used to his advantage. What is humanity? Nothing! Thank 3
God that crude illusion doesn't last! What a grown man worships is truth - 3
knowledge - science - light - the rending of the veil and the pushing back of the 3
shadow. Knowledge, the juggernaut! There is death in our own ritual. We must 3
kill - dissect - destroy - and all for the sake of discovery - the worship of the 3
ineffable light. The goddess Science demands it. We test a doubtful poison by 3
killing. How else? No thought for self - just knowledge - the effect must be 3
known." 3
3
His voice trailed off in a kind of temporary exhaustion, and Georgina shuddered 3
slightly. 3
3
"But this is horrible, Al! You shouldn't think of it that way!" 3
3
Clarendon cackled sardonically, in a manner which stirred odd and repugnant 3
associations in his sister's mind. 3
3
"Horrible? You think what I say is horrible? You ought to hear Surama! I tell you, 3
things were known to the priests of Atlantis that would have you drop dead of 3
fright if you heard a hint of them. Knowledge was knowledge a hundred 3
thousand years ago, when our especial forbears were shambling about Asia as 3
speechless semi-apes! They know something of it in the Hoggar region - there are 3
rumours in the farther uplands of Thibet - and once I heard an old man in China 3
calling on Yog-Sothoth - " 3
3
He turned pale, and made a curious sign in the air with his extended forefinger. 3
Georgina felt genuinely alarmed, but became somewhat calmer as his speech 3
took a less fantastic form. 3
3
"Yes, it may be horrible, but it's glorious too. The pursuit of knowledge, I mean. 3
Certainly, there's no slovenly sentiment connected with it. Doesn't Nature kill - 3
constantly and remorselessly - and are any but fools horrified at the struggle? 3
Killings are necessary. They are the glory of science. We learn something from 3
them, and we can't sacrifice learning to sentiment. Hear the sentimentalities howl 3
against vaccination! They fear it will kill the child. Well, what if it does? How 3
else can we discover the laws of disease concerned? As a scientist's sister you 3
ought to know better that to praise sentiment. You ought to help my work 3
instead of hindering it!" 3
3
"But, Al," protested Georgina, "I haven't the slightest intention of hindering your 3
work. Haven't I always tried to help as much as I could? I am ignorant, I 3
suppose, and can't help very actively; but at least I'm proud of you - proud for 3
3
3
3
1099 3
3
3
3
my own sake and for the family's sake - and I've always tried to smooth the way. 3
You've given me credit for that many a time." 3
3
Clarendon looked at her keenly. 3
3
"Yes," he said jerkily as he rose and strode from the room, "you're right. You've 3
always tried to help as best you know. You may have yet a chance to help still 3
more." 3
3
Georgina, seeing him disappear through the front door, followed him into the 3
yard. Some distance away a lantern was shining through the trees, and as they 3
approached it they saw Surama bending over a large object stretched on the 3
ground. Clarendon, advancing, gave a short grunt; but when Georgina saw what 3
it was she rushed up with a shriek. It was Dick, the great St. Bernard, and he was 3
lying still with reddened eyes and protruding tongue. 3
3
"He's sick, Al!" she cried. "Do something for him, quick!" 3
3
The doctor looked at Surama, who had uttered something in a tongue unknown 3
to Georgina. 3
3
"Take him to the clinic," he ordered; "I'm afraid Dick's caught the fever." 3
3
Surama took up the dog as he had taken poor Tsanpo the day before, and carried 3
him silently to the building near the mall. He did not chuckle this time, but 3
glanced at Clarendon with what appeared to be real anxiety. It almost seemed to 3
Georgina that Surama was asking the doctor to save her pet. 3
3
Clarendon, however, made no move to follow, but stood still for a moment and 3
then sauntered slowly toward the house. Georgina, astonished at such 3
callousness, kept up a running fire of entreaties on Dick's behalf, but it was of no 3
use. Without paying the slightest attention to her pleas he made directly for the 3
library and began to read in a large old book which had lain face down on the 3
table. She put her hand on his shoulder as he sat there, but he did not speak or 3
turn his head. He only kept on reading, and Georgina, glancing curiously over 3
his shoulder, wondered in what strange alphabet this brass-bound tome was 3
written. 3
3
In the cavernous parlour across the hall, sitting alone in the dark a quarter of an 3
hour later, Georgina came to her decision. Something was gravely wrong - just 3
what, and to what extent, she scarcely dared formulate to herself - and it was 3
time that she called in some stronger force to help her. Of course it must be 3
James. He was powerful and capable, and his sympathy and affection would 3
3
3
3
1100 3
3
3
3
shew him the right thing to do. He had known Al always, and would 3
understand. 3
3
It was by this time rather late, but Georgina had resolved on action. Across the 3
hall the light still shone from the library, and she looked wistfully at the doorway 3
as she quietly donned a hat and left the house. Outside the gloomy mansion and 3
forbidding grounds, it was only a short way to Jackson Street, where by good 3
luck she found a carriage to take her to the Western Union telegraph office. There 3
she carefully wrote out a message to James Dalton in Sacramento, asking him to 3
come at once to San Francisco on a matter of the greatest importance to them all. 3
3
V. 3
3
Dalton was frankly perplexed by Georgina's sudden message. He had had no 3
word from the Clarendons since that stormy February evening when Alfred had 3
declared him an outsider to his home; and he in turn had studiously refrained 3
from communicating, even when he had longed to express sympathy after the 3
doctor's summary outing from office. He had fought hard to frustrate the 3
politicians and keep the appointee power, and was bitterly sorry to watch the 3
unseating of a man who, despite recent estrangements, still represented to him 3
the ultimate ideal of scientific competence. 3
3
Now, with this clearly frightened summons before him, he could not imagine 3
what had happened. He knew, though, that Georgina was not one to lose her 3
head or send forth a needless alarm; hence he wasted no time, but took the 3
Overland which left Sacramento within the hour, going at once to his club and 3
sending word to Georgina by a messenger that he was in town and wholly at her 3
service. 3
3
Meanwhile things had been quiescent at the Clarendon home, notwithstanding 3
the doctor's continued taciturnity and his absolute refusal to report on the dog's 3
condition. Shadows of evil seemed omnipresent and thickening, but for the 3
moment there was a lull. Georgina was relieved to get Dalton's message and 3
learn that he was close at hand, and sent back word that she would call him 3
when necessity arose. Amidst all the gathering tension some faint compensating 3
element seemed manifest, and Georgina finally decided that it was the absence of 3
the lean Thibetans, whose stealthy, sinuous ways and disturbing exotic aspect 3
had always annoyed her. They had vanished all at once; and old Margarita, the 3
sole visible servant left in the house, told her they were helping their master and 3
Surama at the clinic. 3
3
The following morning - the twenty-eighth of May - long to be remembered - 3
was dark and lowering, and Georgina felt the precarious calm wearing thin. She 3
3
3
3
1101 3
3
3
3
did not see her brother at all, but knew he was in the clinic hard at work at 3
something despite the lack of specimens he had bewailed. She wondered how 3
poor Tsanpo was getting along, and whether he had really been subjected to any 3
serious inoculation, but it must be confessed that she wondered more about 3
Dick. She longed to know whether Surama had done anything for the faithful 3
dog amidst his master's oddly callous indifference. Surama's apparent solicitude 3
on the night of Dick's seizure had impressed her greatly, giving her perhaps the 3
kindliest feeling she had ever had for the detested clinic-man. Now, as the day 3
advanced, she found herself thinking more and more of Dick; till at last her 3
harassed nerves, finding in this one detail a sort of symbolic summation of the 3
whole horror that lay upon the household, could stand the suspense no longer. 3
3
Up to that time she had always respected Al's imperious wish that he be never 3
approached or disturbed at the clinic; but as this fateful afternoon advanced, her 3
resolution to break through the barrier grew stronger and stronger. Finally she 3
set out with determined face, crossing the yard and entering the unlocked 3
vestibule of the forbidden structure with the fixed intention of discovering how 3
the dog was or of knowing the reason for her brother's secrecy. 3
3
The inner door, as usual, was locked; and behind it she heard voices in heated 3
conversation. When her knocking brought no response she rattled the knob as 3
loudly as possible, but still the voices argued on unheeding. They belonged, of 3
course, to Surama and her brother; and as she stood there trying to attract 3
attention she could not help catch something of their drift. Fate had made her for 3
the second time an eavesdropper, and once more the matter she overheard 3
seemed likely to tax her mental poise and nervous endurance to their ultimate 3
bounds. Alfred and Surama were plainly quarrelling with increasing violence, 3
and the purport of their speech was enough to arouse the wildest fears and 3
confirm the gravest apprehensions. Georgina shivered as her brother's voice 3
mounted shrilly to dangerous heights of fanatical tension. 3
3
"You, damn you - you're a fine one to talk defeat and moderation to me! Who 3
started all this, anyway? Did I have any idea of your cursed devil-gods and elder 3
world? Did I ever in my life think of your damned spaces beyond the stars and 3
your crawling chaos Nyarlathotep? I was a normal scientific man, confound you, 3
till I was fool enough to drag you out of the vaults with your devilish Atlantean 3
secrets. You egged me on, and now you want to cut me off! You loaf around 3
doing nothing and telling me to go slow when you might just as well as not be 3
going out and getting material. You know damn well that I don't know hot to go 3
about such things, whereas you must have been an old hand at it before the earth 3
was made. It's like you, you damned walking corpse, to start something you 3
won't or can't finish!" 3
3
3
3
1102 3
3
3
3
Surama's evil chuckle came. 3
3
"You're insane. Clarendon. That's the only reason I let you rave on when I could 3
send you to hell in three minutes. Enough is enough, and you've certainly had 3
enough material for any novice at your stage. You've had all I'm going to get 3
you, anyhow! You're only a maniac on the subject now - what a cheap, crazy 3
thing to sacrifice even your poor sister's pet dog, when you could have spared 3
him as well as not! You can't look at any living thing without wanting to jab that 3
gold syringe into it. No - Dick had to go where the Mexican boy went - where 3
Tsanpo and the other seven went - where all the animals went! What a pupil! 3
You're no fun any more - you've lost your nerve. You set out to control things, 3
and they're controlling you. I'm about done with you. Clarendon. I thought you 3
had the stuff in you, but you haven't. It's about time I tried somebody else. I'm 3
afraid you'll have to go!" 3
3
In the doctor's shouted reply there was both fear and frenzy. 3
3
"Be careful, you - - ! There are powers against your powers - I didn't go to China 3
for nothing, and there are things in Alhazred's Azif which weren't known in 3
Atlantis! We've both meddled in dangerous things, but you needn't think you 3
know all my resources. How about the Nemesis of Flame? I talked in Yemen 3
with an old man who had come back alive from the Crimson Desert - he had 3
seen Irem, the City of Pillars, and had worshipped at the underground shrines of 3
Nug and Yeb - la! Shub-Niggurath!" 3
3
Through Clarendon's shrieking falsetto cut the deep chuckle of the clinic-man. 3
3
"Shut up, you fool! Do you suppose your grotesque nonsense has any weight 3
with me? Words and formulae - words and formulae - what do they all mean to 3
one who has the substance behind them? We're in a material sphere now, and 3
subject to material laws. You have your fever; I have my revolver. You'll get no 3
specimens and I'll get no fever so long as I have you in front of me with this gun 3
between!" 3
3
That was all Georgina could hear. She felt her senses reeling, and staggered out 3
of the vestibule for a saving breath of the lowering outside air. She that the crisis 3
had come at last, and that help must now arrive quickly if her brother was to be 3
saved from the unknown gulfs of madness and mystery. Summoning up all her 3
reserve energy, she managed to reach the house and get to the library, where she 3
scrawled a hasty note for Margarita to take to James Dalton. 3
3
When the old woman had gone, Georgina had just strength enough to cross to 3
the lounge and sink weakly down into a sort of semi-stupor. There she lay for 3
3
3
3
1103 3
3
3
3
what seemed like years, conscious only of the fantastic creeping up of the 3
twilight from the lower corners of the great, dismal room, and plagued by a 3
thousand shadowy shapes of terror which filed with phantasmal, half-limned 3
pageantry through her tortured and stifled brain. Dusk deepened into darkness, 3
and still the spell held. Then a firm tread sounded in the hall, and she heard 3
someone enter the room and fumble at the match-safe. Her heart almost stopped 3
beating as the gas-jets of the chandelier flared up one by one, but then she saw 3
that the arrival was her brother. Relieved to the bottom of her heart that he was 3
still alive, she gave vent to an involuntary sigh, profound, long-drawn, and 3
tremulous, and lapsed at last into kindly oblivion. 3
3
At the sound of that sigh Clarendon turned in alarm toward the lounge, and was 3
inexpressibly shocked to see the pale and unconscious form of his sister there. 3
Her face had a death-like quality that frightened his inmost spirit, and he flung 3
himself on his knees by her side, awake to a realisation of what her passing away 3
would mean to him. Long unused to private practice amidst his ceaseless quest 3
for truth, he had lost the physician's instinct of first aid, and could only call out 3
her name and chafe her wrists mechanically as fear and grief possessed him. 3
Then he thought of water, and ran to the dining-room for a carafe. Stumbling 3
about in a darkness which seemed to harbour vague terrors, he was some time in 3
finding what he sought; but at last he clutched it in shaking hand and hastened 3
back to dash the cold fluid in Georgina's face. The method was crude but 3
effective. She stirred, sighed a second time, and finally opened her eyes. 3
3
"You are alive!" he cried, and put his cheek to hers as she stroked his head 3
maternally. She was almost glad she fainted, for the circumstance seemed to 3
have dispelled the strange Alfred and brought her own brother back to her. She 3
sat up slowly and tried to reassure him. 3
3
"I'm all right, Al. just give me a glass of water. It's a sin to waste it this way - to 3
say nothing of spoiling my waist! Is that the way to behave every time your sister 3
drops off for a nap? You needn't think I'm going to be sick, for I haven't time for 3
such nonsense!" 3
3
Alfred's eyes shewed that her cool, common-sense speech had had its effect. His 3
brotherly panic dissolved in an instant, and instead there came into his face a 3
vague, calculating expression, as if some marvellous possibility had just dawned 3
upon him. As she watched the subtle waves of cunning and appraisal pass 3
fleetingly over his countenance she became less and less certain that her mode of 3
reassurance had been a wise one, and before he spoke she found herself 3
shivering at something she could not define. A keen medical instinct almost told 3
her that his moment of sanity had passed, and that he was now once more the 3
unrestrained fanatic for scientific research. There was something morbid in the 3
3
3
3
1104 3
3
3
3
quick narrowing of his eyes at her casual mention of good heahh. What was he 3
thinking? To what unnatural extreme was his passion for experiment about to be 3
pushed? Wherein lay the special significance of her pure blood and absolutely 3
flawless organic state? None of these misgivings, however, troubled Georgina for 3
more than a second, and she was quite natural and unsuspicious as she felt her 3
brother's steady fingers at her pulse. 3
3
"You're a bit feverish, Georgina," he said in a precise, elaborately restrained 3
voice as he looked professionally into her eyes. 3
3
"Why, nonsense, I'm all right," she replied. "One would think you were on the 3
watch for fever patients just for the sake of showing off your discovery! It would 3
be poetic, though, if you could your final proof and demonstration by curing 3
your own sister!" 3
3
Clarendon started violently and guiltily. Had she suspected his wish? Had he 3
muttered anything aloud? He looked at her closely, and saw that she had no 3
inkling of the truth. She smiled up sweetly into his face and patted his hand as he 3
stood by the side of the lounge. Then he took a small oblong leather case from his 3
vest pocket, and taking out a little gold syringe, he began fingering it 3
thoughtfully, pushing the piston speculatively in and out of the empty cylinder. 3
3
"I wonder," he began with suave sententiousness, "whether you would really be 3
willing to help science in - something like that way - if the need arose? Whether 3
you would have the devotion to offer yourself to the cause of medicine as a sort 3
of Jephthah's daughter if you knew it meant the absolute perfection and 3
completion of my work?" 3
3
Georgina, catching the odd and unmistakable glitter in her brother's eyes, knew 3
at last that her worst fears were true. There was nothing to now but keep him 3
quiet at all hazards and to pray that Margarita had found James Dalton at his 3
club. 3
3
"You look tired, Al dear," she said gently. "Why not take a little morphia and get 3
some of the sleep you need so badly?" 3
3
He replied with a kind of crafty deliberation. 3
3
"Yes, you're right. I'm worn out, and so are you. Each of us needs a good sleep. 3
Morphine is just the thing - wait till I go and fill the syringe and we'll both take a 3
proper dose." 3
3
Still fingering the empty syringe, he walked softly out of the room. Georgina 3
looked about her with the aimlessness of desperation, ears alert for any sign of 3
3
3
3
1105 3
3
3
3
possible help. She thought she heard Margarita again in the basement kitchen, 3
and rose to ring the bell, in an effort to learn of the fate of her message. The old 3
servant answered her summons at once, and declared she had given the message 3
at the club hours ago. Governor Dalton had been out, but the clerk had promised 3
to deliver the note at the very moment of his arrival. 3
3
Margarita waddled below stairs again, but still Clarendon did not reappear. 3
What was he doing? What was he planning? She had heard the outer door slam, 3
so knew he must be at the clinic. Had he forgotten his original intention with the 3
vacillating mind of madness? The suspense grew almost unbearable, and 3
Georgina had to keep her teeth clenched tightly to avoid screaming. 3
3
It was the gate bell, which rang simultaneously in house and clinic, that broke 3
the tension at last. She heard the cat-like tread of Surama on the walk as he left 3
the clinic to answer it; and the, with an almost hysterical sigh, she caught the 3
firm, familiar accents of Dalton in conversation with the sinister attendant. 3
Rising, she almost tottered to meet him as he loomed up in the library doorway; 3
and for a moment no word was spoken while he kissed her hand in his courtly, 3
old school fashion. Then Georgina burst forth into a torrent of hurried 3
explanation, telling all that had happened, all she had glimpsed and overheard, 3
and all she feared and suspected. 3
3
Dalton listened gravely and comprehendingly, his first bewilderment gradually 3
giving place to astonishment, sympathy, and resolution. The message, held by a 3
careless clerk, had been slightly delayed, and had found him appropriately 3
enough in the midst of a warm lounging-room discussion about Clarendon. A 3
fellow-member. Dr. MacNeil, had brought in a medical journal with an article 3
well calculated to disturb the devoted scientist, and Dalton had just asked to 3
keep the paper for future reference when the message was handed him at last. 3
Abandoning his half-formed plan to take Dr. MacNeil into his confidence 3
regarding Alfred, he called at once for his hat and stick, and lost not a moment in 3
getting a cab for the Clarendon home. 3
3
Surama, he thought, appeared alarmed at recognising him; though he had 3
chuckled as usual when striding off again toward the clinic. Dalton always 3
recalled Surama's stride and chuckle on this ominous night, for he was never to 3
see the unearthly creature again. As the chuckler entered the clinic vestibule his 3
deep, guttural gurgles seemed to blend with some low mutterings of thunder 3
which troubled the far horizon. 3
3
When Dalton had heard all Georgina had to say, and learned that Alfred was 3
expected back at any moment with an hypodermic dose of morphine, he decided 3
he had better talk with the doctor alone. Advising Georgina to retire to her room 3
3
3
3
1106 3
3
3
3
and await developments, he walked about the gloomy library, scanning the 3
shelves and listening for Clarendon's nervous footstep on the clinic path outside. 3
The vast room's corners were dismal despite the chandelier, and the closer 3
Dalton looked at his friend's choice of books the less he liked them. It was not the 3
balanced collection of a normal physician, biologist, or man of general culture. 3
There were too many volumes on doubtful borderland themes; dark speculations 3
and forbidden rituals of the Middle Ages, and strange exotic mysteries in alien 3
alphabets both known and unknown. 3
3
The great notebook of observations on the table was unwholesome, too. The 3
handwriting had a neurotic cast, and the spirit of the entries was far from 3
reassuring. Long passages were inscribed in crabbed Greek characters, and as 3
Dalton marshaled his linguistic memory for their translation he gave a sudden 3
start, and wished his college struggles with Xenophon and Homer had been 3
more conscientious. There was something wrong - something hideously wrong - 3
here, and the governor sank limply into the chair by the table as he pored more 3
and more closely over the doctor's barbarous Greek. Then a sound came, 3
startlingly near, and he jumped nervously at a hand laid sharply on his shoulder. 3
3
"What, may I ask, is the cause of this intrusion? You might have stated your 3
business to Surama." 3
3
Clarendon was standing icily by the chair, the little gold syringe in one hand. He 3
seemed very calm and rational, and Dalton fancied for a moment that Georgina 3
must have exaggerated his condition. How, too, could a rusty scholar be 3
absolutely sure about these Greek entries? The governor decided to be very 3
cautious in his interview, and thanked the lucky chance which had a specious 3
pretext in his coat pocket. He was very cool and assured as he rose to reply. 3
3
"I didn't think you'd care to have things dragged before a subordinate, but I 3
thought you ought to see this article at once." 3
3
He drew forth the magazine given him by Dr. MacNeil and handed it to 3
Clarendon. 3
3
"On page 542 - you see the heading, 'Black Fever Conquered by New Serum.' It's 3
by Dr. Miller of Philadelphia - and he thinks he's got ahead of you with your 3
cure. They were discussing it at the club, and MacNeil thought the exposition 3
very convincing. I, as a layman, couldn't pretend to judge; but at all events I 3
thought you oughtn't to miss a chance to digest the thing while it's fresh. If 3
you're busy, of course, I won't disturb you - " 3
3
Clarendon cut in sharply. 3
3
3
3
1107 3
3
3
3
"I'm going to give my sister an hypodermic - she's not quite well - but I'll look at 3
what that quack has to say when I get back. I know Miller - a damn sneak and 3
incompetent - and I don't believe he has the brains to steal my methods from the 3
little he's seen of them." 3
3
Dalton suddenly felt a wave of intuition warning him that Georgina must not 3
receive that intended dose. There was something sinister about it. From what she 3
had said, Alfred must have been inordinately long preparing it, far longer than 3
was needed for the dissolving of a morphine tablet. He decided to hold his host 3
as long as possible, meanwhile testing his attitude in a more or less subtle way. 3
3
"I'm sorry Georgina isn't well. Are you sure that the injection will do her good? 3
That it won't do her any harm?" 3
3
Clarendon's spasmodic start shewed that something had been struck home. 3
3
"Do her harm?" he cried. "Don't be absurd! You know Georgina must be in the 3
best of health - the very best, I say - in order to serve science as a Clarendon 3
should serve it. She, at least, appreciates the fact that she is my sister. She deems 3
no sacrifice too great in my service. She is a priestess of truth and discovery, as I 3
am a priest." 3
3
He paused in his shrill tirade, wild-eyed, and somewhat out of breath. Dalton 3
could see that his attention had been momentarily shifted. 3
3
"But let me see what this cursed quack has to say," he continued. "If he thinks 3
his pseudo-medical rhetoric can take a real doctor in, he is even simpler than I 3
thought!" 3
3
Clarendon nervously found the right page and began reading as he stood there 3
clutching his syringe. Dalton wondered what the real facts were. MacNeil had 3
assured him that the author was a pathologist of the highest standing, and that 3
whatever errors the article might have, the mind behind it was powerful, erudite, 3
and absolutely honourable and sincere. 3
3
Watching the doctor as he read, Dalton saw the thin, bearded face grow pale. The 3
great eyes blazed, and the pages crackled in the tenser grip of the long, lean 3
fingers. A perspiration broke out on the high, ivory- white forehead where the 3
hair was already thinning, and the reader sank gaspingly into the chair his visitor 3
had vacated as he kept on with his devouring of the tract. Then came a wild 3
scream as from a haunted beast, and Clarendon lurched forward on the table, his 3
outflung arms sweeping books and paper before them as consciousness went out 3
like a wind-quenched candle-flame. 3
3
3
3
1108 3
3
3
3
Dalton, springing to help his stricken friend, raised the sHm form and tihed it 3
back in the chair. Seeing the carafe on the floor near the lounge, he dashed some 3
water into the twisted face, and was rewarded by seeing the large eyes slowly 3
open. They were sane eyes now - deep and sad and unmistakably sane - and 3
Dalton felt awed in the presence of a tragedy whose ultimate depth he could 3
never hope or dare to plumb. 3
3
The golden hypodermic was still clutched in the lean left hand, and as Clarendon 3
drew a deep, shuddering breath he unclosed his fingers and studied the 3
glittering thing that rolled about on his palm. Then he spoke - slowly, and with 3
the ineffable sadness of utter, absolute despair. 3
3
"Thanks, Jimmy, I'm quite all right. But there's much to be done. You asked me a 3
while back if this shot of morphia would do Georgie any harm. I'm in a position 3
now to tell you that it won't." 3
3
He turned a small screw in the syringe and laid a finger on the piston, at the 3
same time pulling with his left hand at the skin of his own neck. Dalton cried out 3
in alarm as a lightning motion of his right hand injected the contents of the 3
cylinder into the ridge of distended flesh. 3
3
"Good Lord, Al, what have you done?" 3
3
Clarendon smiled gently - a smile almost of peace and resignation, different 3
indeed from the sardonic sneer of the past few weeks. 3
3
"You ought to know, Jimmy, if you've still the judgment that made you a 3
governor. You must have pieced together enough from my notes to realise that 3
there's nothing else to do. With your marks in Greek back at Columbia I guess 3
you couldn't have missed much. All I can say is that it's true. 3
3
"James, I don't like to pass blame along, but it's only right to tell you that Surama 3
got me into this. I can't tell you who or what he is, for I don't fully know myself, 3
and what I do know is stuff that no sane person ought to know; but I will say 3
that I don't consider him a human being in the fullest sense, and that I'm not sure 3
whether or not he's alive as we know life. 3
3
"You think I'm talking nonsense. I wish I were, but the whole hideous mess is 3
damnably real. I started out in life with a clean mind and purpose. I wanted to 3
rid the world of fever. I tried and failed - and I wish to God I had been honest 3
enough to say that I'd failed. Don't let my old talk of science deceive you, James - 3
I found no antitoxin and was never even half on the track of one! 3
3
3
3
1109 3
3
3
3
"Don't look so shaken up, old fellow! A veteran politician-fighter like you must 3
have seen plenty of unmaskings before. I tell you, I never even had the start of a 3
fever cure. But my studies had taken me into some queer places, and it was just 3
my damned luck to listen to the stories of some still queerer people. James, if you 3
ever wish any man well, tell him to keep clear of the ancient, hidden places of the 3
earth. Old backwaters are dangerous - things are handed down there that don't 3
do healthy people any good. I talked too much with old priests and mystics, and 3
got to hoping I might achieve things in dark ways that I couldn't achieve in 3
lawful ways. 3
3
"I shan't tell you just what I mean, for if I did I'd be as bad as the old priests that 3
were the ruin of me. All I need say is that after what I've learned I shudder at the 3
thought of the world and what it's been through. The world is cursed old, James, 3
and there have been whole chapters lived and closed before the dawn of our 3
organic life and the geologic eras connected with it. It's an awful thought - whole 3
forgotten cycles of evolution with beings and races and wisdom and diseases - all 3
lived through and gone before the first amoeba ever stirred in the tropic seas 3
geology tells us about. 3
3
"I said gone, but I didn't quite mean that. It would have been better that way, but 3
it wasn't quite so. In places traditions have kept on - I can't tell you how - and 3
certain archaic life-forms have managed to struggle thinly down the aeons in 3
hidden spots. There were cults, you know - bands of evil priests in lands now 3
buried under the sea. Atlantis was the hotbed. That was a terrible place. If 3
heaven is merciful, no one will ever drag up that horror from the deep. 3
3
"It had a colony, though, that didn't sink; and when you get too confidential 3
with one of the Tuareg priests in Africa, he's likely to tell you wild tales about it - 3
tales that connect up with whispers you'll hear among the mad lamas and flighty 3
yak-drivers on the secret table-lands of Asia. I'd heard all the common tales and 3
whispers when I came on the big one. What that was, you'll never know - but it 3
pertained to somebody or something that had come down from a blasphemously 3
long time ago, and could be made to live again - or seem alive again - through 3
certain processes that weren't very clear to the man who told me. 3
3
"Now, James, in spite of my confessions about the fever, you know I'm not bad 3
as a doctor. I plugged hard at medicine, and soaked up about as much as the next 3
man - maybe a little more, because down there in the Hoggar country I did 3
something no priest had ever been able to do. They led me blindfolded to a place 3
that had been sealed up for generations - and I came back with Surama. 3
3
"Easy, James! I know what you want to say. How does he know all he knows? - 3
why does he speak English - or any other language, for that matter - without an 3
3
3
3
1110 3
3
3
3
accent? - why did he come away with me? - and all that. I can't tell you 3
altogether, but I can say that he takes in ideas and images and impressions with 3
something besides his brains and senses. He had a use for me and my science. He 3
told me things, and opened up vistas. He taught me to worship ancient, 3
primordial, and unholy gods, and mapped out a road to a terrible goal which I 3
can't even hint to you. Don't press me, James - it's for the sake of your sanity and 3
the world's sanity! 3
3
"The creature is beyond all bounds. He's in league with the stars and all the 3
forces of Nature. Don't think I'm still crazy, James - I swear to you I'm not! I've 3
had too many glimpses to doubt. He gave me new pleasures that were forms of 3
his palaeogean worship, and the greatest of those was the black fever. 3
3
"God, James! Haven't you seen through the business by this time? Do you still 3
believe the black fever came out of Thibet, and that I learned about it there? Use 3
your brains, man! Look at Miller's article here! He's found a basic antitoxin that 3
will end all fever within half a century, when other men learn how to modify it 3
for the different forms. He's cut the ground of my youth from under me - done 3
what I'd have given my life to do - taken the wind out of all the honest sails I 3
ever flung to the breeze of science! Do you wonder his article gave me a turn? Do 3
you wonder it shocks me out of my madness back to the old dreams of my 3
youth? Too late! Too late! But not too late to save others! 3
3
"I guess I'm rambling a bit now, old man. You know - the hypodermic. I asked 3
you why you didn't tumble to the facts about black fever. How could you, 3
though? Doesn't Miller say he's cured seven cases with his serum? A matter of 3
diagnosis, James. He only thinks it is black fever. I can read between his lines. 3
Here, old chap, on page 551, is the key to the whole thing. Read it again. 3
3
"You see, don't you? The fever cases from the Pacific Coast didn't respond to his 3
serum. They puzzled him. They didn't even seem like any true fever he knew. 3
Well, those were my cases! Those were the real black fever cases! And there can't 3
ever be an antitoxin on earth that'll cure black fever! 3
3
"How do I know? Because black fever isn't of this earth! It's from somewhere 3
else, James - and Surama alone knows where, because he brought it here. He 3
brought it and I spread it! That's the secret, James! That's all I wanted the 3
appointment for - that's all I ever did - just spread the fever that I carried in the 3
gold syringe and in the deadlier finger-ring-pump-syringe you see on my index 3
finger! Science? A blind! I wanted to kill, and kill, and kill! A single pressure on 3
my finger, and the black fever was inoculated. I wanted to see living things 3
writhe and squirm, scream and froth at the mouth. A single pressure of the 3
pump-syringe and I could watch them as they died, and I couldn't live or think 3
3
3
3
1111 3
3
3
3
unless I had plenty to watch. That's why I jabbed everything in sight with the 3
accursed hollow needle. Animals, criminals, children, servants - and the next 3
would have been - " 3
3
Clarendon's voice broke, and he crumpled up perceptibly in his chair. 3
3
"That - that, James - was - my life. Surama made it so - he taught me, and kept 3
me at it till I couldn't stop. Then - then it got too much even for him. He tried to 3
check me. Fancy - he trying to check anybody in that line! But now I've got my 3
last specimen. That is my last test. Good subject, James - I'm healthy - devilish 3
healthy. Deuced ironic, though - the madness has gone now, so there won't be 3
any fun watching the agony! Can't he - can't - " 3
3
A violent shiver of fever racked the doctor, and Dalton mourned amidst his 3
horror-stupefaction that he could give no grief. How much of Alfred's story was 3
sheer nonsense, and how much nightmare truth he could not say; but in any case 3
he felt that the man was a victim rather than a criminal, and above all, he was a 3
boyhood comrade and Georgina's brother. Thoughts of the old days came back 3
kaleidoscopically. 'Little Alf - the yard at Phillips Exeter - the quadrangle at 3
Columbia - the fight with Tom Cortland when he saved Alf from a pommeling. . . 3
3
He helped Clarendon to the lounge and asked gently what he could do. There 3
was nothing. Alfred could only whisper now, but he asked forgiveness for all his 3
offences, and commended his sister to the care of his friend. 3
3
"You - you'll - make her happy," he gasped. "She deserves it. Martyr - to - a 3
myth! Make it up to her, James. Don't - let - her - know - more - than she has to!" 3
3
His voice trailed off in a mumble, and he fell into a stupor. Dalton rang the bell, 3
but Margarita had gone to bed, so he called up the stairs for Georgina. She was 3
firm of step, but very pale. Alfred's scream had tried her sorely, but she trusted 3
James. She trusted him still as he shewed her the unconscious form on the lounge 3
and asked to her go back to her room and rest, no matter what sounds she might 3
hear. He did not wish her to witness the spectacle of delirium certain to come, 3
but bade her kiss her brother a final farewell as he lay there calm and still, very 3
like the delicate boy he had once been. So she left him - the strange, moonstruck, 3
star-reading genius she had mothered so long - and the picture she carried away 3
was a very merciful one. 3
3
Dalton must bear to his grave a sterner picture. His fears of delirium were not 3
vain, and all through the black midnight hours his giant strength restrained the 3
fearful contortion of the mad sufferer. What he heard from those swollen, 3
blackening lips he will never repeat. He has never been quite the same man 3
3
3
3
1112 3
3
3
3
since, and he knows that no one who hears such things can ever be wholly as he 3
was before. So, for the world's good, he dares not speak, and he thanks God that 3
his layman's ignorance of certain subjects makes many of the revelations cryptic 3
and meaningless to him. 3
3
Toward morning Clarendon suddenly woke to a sane consciousness and began 3
to speak in a firm voice. 3
3
"James, I didn't tell you what must be done - about everything. Blot out those 3
entries in Greek and send my notebook to Dr. Miller. All my other notes, too, 3
that you'll find in the files. He's the big authority today - his article proves it. 3
Your friend at the club was right. 3
3
"But everything in the clinic must go. Everything without exception, dead or 3
alive or - otherwise. All the plagues of hell are in those bottles on the shelves. 3
Burn them - burn it all - if one thing escapes, Surama will spread black death 3
throughout the world. And above all burn Surama! That - that thing - must not 3
breathe the wholesome air of heaven. You know now - what I told you - why 3
such an entity can't be allowed on earth. It won't be murder - Surama isn't 3
human - if you're as pious as you used to be, James, I shan't have to urge you. 3
Remember the old text - 'Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live' - or something of 3
the sort. 3
3
"Burn him, James! Don't let him chuckle again over the torture of mortal flesh! I 3
say, burn him - the Nemesis of Flame - that's all that can reach him, James, unless 3
you catch him asleep and drive a wooden stake through his heart... Kill him - 3
extirpate him - cleanse the decent universe of its primal taint - the taint I recalled 3
from its age-long sleep... " 3
3
The doctor had risen on his elbow, and his voice was a piercing shriek toward 3
the last. The effort was too much, however, and he lapsed very suddenly into a 3
deep, tranquil coma. Dalton, himself fearless of fever, since he knew the dread 3
germ to be non-contagious, composed Alfred's arms and legs on the lounge and 3
threw a light afghan over the fragile form. After all, mightn't much of this horror 3
be exaggeration and delirium? Mightn't old Doc MacNeil pull him through on a 3
long chance? The governor strove to keep awake, and walked briskly up and 3
down the room, but his energies had been taxed too deeply for such measures. A 3
second's rest in the chair by the table took matters out of his hands, and he was 3
presently sleeping soundly despite his best intentions. 3
3
Dalton started up as a fierce light shone in his eyes, and for a moment he thought 3
the dawn had come. But it was not the dawn, and as he rubbed his heavy lids he 3
saw that it was the glare of the burning clinic in the yard, whose stout planks 3
3
3
3
1113 3
3
3
3
flamed and roared and crackled heavenward in the most stupendous holocaust 3
he had ever seen. It was indeed the "Nemesis of Flame" that Clarendon had 3
wished, and Dalton felt that some strange combustibles must be involved in a 3
blaze so much wilder than anything normal pine of redwood could afford. He 3
glanced alarmedly at the lounge, but Alfred was not there. Starting up, he went 3
to call Georgina, but met her in the hall, roused as he was by the mountain of 3
living fire. 3
3
"The clinic's burning down!" she cried. "How is Al now?" 3
3
"He's disappeared - disappeared while I dropped asleep!" replied Dalton, 3
reaching out a steadying arm to the form which faintness had begun to sway. 3
3
Gently leading her upstairs toward her room, he promised to search at once for 3
Alfred, but Georgina slowly shook her head as the flames from outside cast a 3
weird glow through the window on the landing. 3
3
"He must be dead, James - he could never live, sane and knowing what he did. I 3
heard him quarrelling with Surama, and know that awful things were going on. 3
He is my brother, but - it is best as it is." 3
3
Her voice had sunk to a whisper. 3
3
Suddenly through the open window came the sound of a deep, hideous chuckle, 3
and the flames of the burning clinic took fresh contours till they half resembled 3
some nameless, Cyclopean creatures of nightmare. James and Georgina paused 3
hesitant, and peered out breathlessly through the landing window. Then from 3
the sky came a thunderous peal, as a forked bolt of lightning shot down with 3
terrible directness into the very midst of the blazing ruin. The deep chuckle 3
ceased, and in its place came a frantic, ululant yelp of a thousand ghouls and 3
werewolves in torment. It died away with long, reverberant echoes, and slowly 3
the flames resumed their normal shape. 3
3
The watchers did not move, but waited till the pillar of fire had shrunk to a 3
smouldering glow. They were glad of a half-rusticity which had kept the firemen 3
from trooping out, and of the wall that excluded the curious. What had 3
happened was not for vulgar eyes - it involved too much of the universe's inner 3
secrets for that. 3
3
In the pale dawn, James spoke softly to Georgina, who could do no more than 3
put her head on his breast and sob. 3
3
"Sweetheart, I think he has atoned. He must have set the fire, you know, while I 3
was asleep. He told me it ought to be burned - the clinic, and everything in it. 3
3
3
3
1114 3
3
3
3
Surama, too. It was the only way to save the world from the unknown horrors he 3
had loosed upon it. He knew, and he did what was best. 3
3
"He was a great man, Georgie. Let's never forget that. We must always be proud 3
of him, for he started out to help mankind, and was titanic even in his sins. I'll 3
tell you more sometime. What he did, be it good or evil, was what no man ever 3
did before. He was the first and last to break through certain veils, and even 3
ApoUonius of Tyana takes second place beside him. But we mustn't talk about 3
that. We must remember him only as the Little Alf we knew - as the boy who 3
wanted to master medicine and conquer fever." 3
3
In the afternoon the leisurely firemen overhauled the ruins and found two 3
skeletons with bits of blackened flesh adhering - only two, thanks to the 3
undisturbed lime-pits. One was of a man; the other is still a subject of debate 3
among the biologists of the coast. It was not exactly an ape's or a saurian's 3
skeleton, but it had disturbing suggestions of lines of evolution of which 3
palaeontology has revealed no trace. The charred skull, oddly enough, was 3
human, and reminded people of Surama, but the rest of the bones were beyond 3
conjecture. Only well-cut clothing could have made such a body look like a man. 3
3
But the human bones were Clarendon's. No one disputed this, and the world at 3
large still mourns the untimely death of the greatest doctor of his age; the 3
bacteriologist whose universal fever serum would have far eclipsed Dr. Miller's 3
kindred antitoxin had he lived to bring it to perfection. Much of Miller's late 3
success, indeed, is credited to the notes bequeathed him by the hapless victim of 3
the flames. Of the old rivalry and hatred almost none survived, and even Dr. 3
Wilfred Jones has been known to boast of his association with the vanished 3
leader. 3
3
James Dalton and his wife Georgina have always preserved a reticence which 3
modesty and family grief might well account for. They published certain notes as 3
a tribute to the great man's memory, but have never confirmed or contradicted 3
either the popular estimate or the rare hints of marvels that a very few keen 3
thinkers have been to whisper. It was very subtly and slowly that the facts 3
filtered out. Dalton probably gave Dr. MacNeil an inkling of the truth, and that 3
good soul had not many secrets from his son. 3
3
The Daltons have led, on the whole, a very happy life, for their cloud of terror 3
lies far in the background, and a strong mutual love has kept the world fresh for 3
them. But there are things which disturb them oddly - little things, of which one 3
would scarcely ever think of complaining. They cannot bear persons who are 3
lean or deep-voiced beyond certain limits, and Georgina turns pale at the sound 3
of any guttural chuckling. Senator Dalton has a mixed horror of occultism, travel. 3
3

3
3
3
hypodermics, and strange alphabets which most find hard to unify, and there are 3
still those who blame him for the vast proportion of the doctor's library that he 3
destroyed with such painstaking completeness. 3
3
MacNeil, though, seemed to realise. He was a simple man, and he said a prayer 3
as the last of Alfred Clarendon's strange books crumbled to ashes. Nor would 3
anyone who had peered understandingly within those books wish a word of that 3
prayer unsaid. 3

3
Ben Hayden was always a stubborn chap, and once he had heard about those 3
strange statues in the upper Adirondacks, nothing could keep him from going to 3
see them. I had been his closest acquaintance for years, and our Damon and 3
Pythias friendship made us inseparable at all times. So when Ben finally decided 3
to go - well, I had to trot along too, like a faithful collie. 3
3
"Jack," he said, "you know Henry Jackson, who was up in a shack beyond Lake 3
Placid for that beastly spot in his lung? Well, he came back the other day nearly 3
cured, but had a lot to say about some devilish queer conditions up there. He ran 3
into the business all of a sudden and can't be sure yet that it's anything more 3
than a case of bizarre sculpture; but just the same his uneasy impression sticks. 3
3
"It seems he was out hunting one day, and came across a cave with what looked 3
like a dog in front of it. Just as he was expecting the dog to bark he looked again, 3
and saw the thing wasn't alive at all. It was a stone dog - such a perfect image, 3
down to the smallest whisker, that he couldn't decide whether it was a 3
supernaturally clever statue or a petrified animal. He was almost afraid to touch 3
it, but when he did he realized it was surely made of stone. 3
3
"After a while he nerved himself up to go into the cave - and there he got a still 3
bigger jolt. Only a little way in there was another stone figure - or what looked 3
like it - but this time it was a man's. It lay on the floor, on its side, wore clothes, 3
and had a peculiar smile on its face. This time Henry didn't stop to do any 3
touching, but beat it straight to the village. Mountain Top, you know. Of course 3
he asked questions - but they did not get him very far. He found he was on a 3
ticklish subject, for the natives only shook their heads, crossed their fingers, and 3
muttered something about a 'Mad Dan' - whoever he was. 3
3
"It was too much for Jackson, so he came home weeks ahead of his planned time. 3
He told me all about it because he knows how fond I am of strange things - and 3
oddly enough, I was able to fish up a recollection that dovetailed pretty neatly 3
with his yarn. Do you remember Arthur Wheeler, the sculptor who was such a 3
realist that people began calling him nothing but a solid photographer? I think 3
you knew him slightly. Well, as a matter of fact, he ended up in that part of the 3
Adirondacks himself. Spent a lot of time there, and then dropped out of sight. 3
3
3
3
1117 3
3
3
3
Never heard from again. Now if stone statues that look Hke men and dogs are 3
turning up around there, it looks to me as if they might be his work - no matter 3
what the rustics say, or refuse to say, about them. Of course a fellow with 3
Jackson's nerves might easily get flighty and disturbed over things like that; but 3
I'd have done a lot of examining before running away. 3
3
"In fact. Jack, I'm going up there now to look things over - and you're coming 3
along with me. It would mean a lot to find Wheeler - or any of his work. 3
Anyhow, the mountain air will brace us both up." 3
3
So less then a week later, after a long train ride and a jolting bus trip through 3
breathlessly exquisite scenery, we arrived at Mountain Top in the late, golden 3
sunlight of a June evening. The village comprised only a few small houses, a 3
hotel, and the general store at which our bus drew up; but we knew that the 3
latter would probably prove a focus for such information. Surely enough, the 3
usual group of idlers was gathered around the steps; and when we represented 3
ourselves as health-seekers in search of lodgings they had many 3
recommendations to offer. 3
3
Though we had not planned to do any investigating till the next day, Ben could 3
not resist venturing some vague, cautious questions when he noticed the senile 3
garrulousness of one of the ill-clad loafers. He felt, from Jackson's previous 3
experience, that it would be useless to begin with references to the queer statues; 3
but decided to mention Wheeler as one whom we had known, and in whose fate 3
we consequently had a right to be interested. 3
3
The crowd seemed uneasy when Sam stopped his whittling and started talking, 3
but they had slight occasion for alarm. Even this barefoot old mountain decadent 3
tightened up when he heard Wheeler's name, and only with difficulty could Ben 3
get anything coherent out of him. 3
3
"Wheeler?" he had finally wheezed. "Oh, yeh - that feller as was all the time 3
blastin' rocks and cuttin' 'em up into statues. So yew knowed him, hey? Wal, 3
they ain't much we kin tell ye, and mebbe that's too much. He stayed out to Mad 3
Dan's cabin in the hills - but not so very long. Got so he wa'nt wanted around no 3
more... by Dan, that is. Kinder soft-spoken and got around Dan's wife till the old 3
devil took notice. Pretty sweet on her, I guess. But he took the trail sudden, and 3
nobody's seen hide nor hair of him since. Dan must a told him sumthin' pretty 3
plain - bad feller to get agin ye, Dan is! Better keep away from thar, boys, for they 3
ain't no good in that part of the hills. Dan's ben workin' up a worse and worse 3
mood, and ain't seen about no more. Nor his wife, neither. Guess he's penned 3
her up so's nobody else kin make eyes at her!" 3
3
3
3
1118 3
3
3
3
As Sam resumed his whittling after a few more observations, Ben and I 3
exchanged glances. Here, surely, was a new lead which deserved intensive 3
following up. Deciding to lodge at the hotel, we settled ourselves as quickly as 3
possible; planning for a plunge into the wild hilly country on the next day. 3
3
At sunrise we made our start, each bearing a knapsack laden with provisions and 3
such tools as we thought we might need. The day before us had an almost 3
stimulating air of invitation - through which only a faint undercurrent of the 3
sinister ran. Our rough mountain road quickly became steep and winding, so 3
that before long our feet ached considerably. 3
3
After about two miles we left the road - crossing a stone wall on our right near a 3
great elm and striking off diagonally toward a steeper slope according to the 3
chart and directions which Jackson had prepared for us. It was rough and briery 3
travelling, but we knew that the cave could not be far off. In the end we came 3
upon the aperture quite suddenly - a black, bush-grown crevice where the 3
ground shot abruptly upward, and beside it, near a shallow rock pool, a small, 3
still figure stood rigid - as if rivalling its own uncanny petrification. 3
3
It was a grey dog - or a dog's statue - and as our simultaneous gasp died away 3
we scarcely knew what to think. Jackson had exaggerated nothing, and we could 3
not believe that any sculptor's hand had succeeded in producing such perfection. 3
Every hair of the animal's magnificent coat seemed distinct, and those on the 3
back were bristled up as if some unknown thing had taken his unaware. Ben, at 3
last half-kindly touching the delicate stony fur, gave vent to an exclamation. 3
3
"Good God, Jack, but this can't be any statue! Look at it - all the little details, and 3
the way the hair lies! None of Wheeler's technique here! This is a real dog - 3
though heaven only knows how he ever got in this state. Just like stone - feel for 3
yourself. Do you suppose there's any strange gas that sometimes comes out of 3
the cave and does this to animal life? We ought to have looked more into the 3
local legends. And if this is a real dog - or was a real dog - then that man inside 3
must be the real thing too." 3
3
It was with a good deal of genuine solemnity - almost dread - that we finally 3
crawled on hands and knees through the cave-mouth, Ben leading. The 3
narrowness looked hardly three feet, after which the grotto expanded in every 3
direction to form a damp, twilight chamber floored with rubble and detritus. For 3
a time we could make out very little, but as we rose to our feet and strained our 3
eyes we began slowly to descry a recumbent figure amidst the greater darkness 3
ahead. Ben fumbled with his flashlight, but hesitated for a moment before 3
turning it on the prostate figure. We had little doubt that the stony thing was 3
what had once been a man, and something in the thought unnerved us both. 3
3
3
3
1119 3
3
3
3
When Ben at last sent forth the electric beam we saw that the object lay on its 3
side, back toward us. It was clearly of the same material as the dog outside, but 3
was dressed in the mouldering and unpetrified remains of rough sport clothing. 3
Braced as we were for a shock, we approached quite calmly to examine the thing; 3
Ben going around to the other side to glimpse the averted face. Neither could 3
possibly have been prepared for what Ben saw when he flashed the light on 3
those stony features. His cry was wholly excusable, and I could not help echoing 3
it as I leaped to his side and shared the sight. Yet it was nothing hideous or 3
intrinsically terrifying. It was merely a matter of recognition, for beyond the least 3
shadow of a doubt this chilly rock figure with its half-frightened, half-bitter 3
expression had at one time been our old acquaintance, Arthur Wheeler. 3
3
Some instinct sent us staggering and crawling out of the cave, and down the 3
tangled slope to a point whence we could not see the ominous stone dog. We 3
hardly knew what to think, for our brains were churning with conjectures and 3
apprehensions. Ben, who had known Wheeler well, was especially upset; and 3
seemed to be piecing together some threads I had overlooked. 3
3
Again and again as we passed on the green slope he repeated "Poor Arthur, poor 3
Arthur!" but not till he muttered the name "Mad Dan" did I recall the trouble 3
into which, just before his disappearance. Mad Dan, Ben implied, would 3
doubtless be glad to see what had happened. For a moment it flashed over both 3
of us that the jealous host might have been responsible for the sculptor's 3
presence in this evil cave, but the thought went as quickly as it came. 3
3
The thing that puzzled us most was to account for the phenomenon itself. What 3
gaseous emanation or mineral vapour could have wrought this change in so 3
relatively short a time was utterly beyond us. Normal petrification, we know, is a 3
slow chemical replacement process requiring vast ages for completion; yet here 3
were two stone images which had been living things - or at least Wheeler had - 3
only a few weeks before. Conjecture was useless. Clearly, nothing remained but 3
to notify the authorities and let them guess what they might; and yet at the back 3
of Ben's head that notion about Mad Dan still persisted. Anyhow, we clawed our 3
way back to the road, but Ben did not turn toward the village, but looked along 3
upward toward where old Sam had said Dan's cabin lay. It was the second house 3
from the village, the ancient loafer had wheezed, and lay on the left far back from 3
the road in a thick copse of scrub oaks. Before I knew it Ben was dragging me up 3
the sandy highway past a dingy farmstead and into a region of increasing 3
wildness. 3
3
It did not occur to me to protest, but I felt a certain sense of mounting menace as 3
the familiar marks of agriculture and civilization grew fewer and fewer. At last 3
the beginning of a narrow, neglected path opened up on our left, while the 3
3
3
3
1120 3
3
3
3
peaked roof of a squalid, unpainted building shewed itself beyond a sickly 3
growth of half-dead trees. This, I knew, must be Mad Dan's cabin; and I 3
wondered that wheeler had ever chosen so unprepossessing a place for his 3
headquarters. I dreaded to walk up that weedy, uninviting path, but could not 3
lag behind, when Ben strode determinedly along and began a vigorous rapping 3
at the rickety, musty-smelling door. 3
3
There was no response to the knock, and something in its echoes sent a series of 3
shivers through one. Ben, however, was quite unperturbed; and at once began to 3
circle the house in quest of unlocked windows. The third that he tried - in the 3
rear of the dismal cabin - proved capable of opening, and after a boost and a 3
vigorous spring he was safely inside and helping me after him. 3
3
The room in which we landed was full of limestone and granite blocks, chiselling 3
tools and clay models, and we realised at once that it was Wheeler's erstwhile 3
studio. So far we had not met with any sign of life, but over everything hovered a 3
damnably ominous dusty odour. On our left was an open door evidently leading 3
to a kitchen on the chimney side of the house, and through this Ben started, 3
intent on finding anything he could concerning his friend's last habitat. He was 3
considerably ahead of me when he crossed the threshold, so that I could not see 3
at first what brought him up short and wrung a low cry of horror from his lips. 3
3
In another moment, though, I did see - and repeated his cry as instinctively as I 3
had done in the cave. For here in this cabin - far from any subterranean depths 3
which could breed strange gases and work strange mutations - were two stony 3
figures which I knew at once were no products of Arthur Wheeler's chisel. In a 3
rude armchair before the fireplace, bound in position by the lash of a long 3
rawhide whip, was the form of a man - unkempt, elderly, and with a look of 3
fathomless horror on its evil, petrified face. 3
3
On the floor beside it lay a woman's figure; graceful, and with a face betokening 3
considerable youth and beauty. Its expression seemed to be one of sardonic 3
satisfaction, and near its outflung right hand was a large tin pail, somewhat 3
stained on the inside, as with a darkish sediment. 3
3
We made no move to approach those inexplicably petrified bodies, nor did we 3
exchange any but the simplest conjectures. That this stony couple hand been 3
Mad Dan and his wife we could not well doubt, but how to account for their 3
present condition was another matter. As we looked horrifiedly around we saw 3
the suddenness with which the final development must have come - for 3
everything about us seemed, despite a heavy coating of dust, to have been left in 3
the midst of commonplace household activities. 3
3
3
3
1121 3
3
3
3
The only exception to this rule of casualness was on the kitchen table; in whose 3
cleared centre, as if to attract attention, lay a thin, battered, blank-book weighed 3
down by a sizeable tin funnel. Crossing to read the thing, Ben saw that it was a 3
kind of diary or set of dated entries, written in a somewhat cramped and none 3
too practiced hand. The very first words riveted my attention, and before ten 3
seconds had elapsed he was breathlessly devouring the halting text - I avidly 3
following as I peered over his shoulder. As we read on - moving as we did so 3
into the less loathsome atmosphere of the adjoining room - many obscure things 3
became terribly clear to us, and we trembled with a mixture of complex 3
emotions. 3
3
This is what we read - and what the coroner read later on. The public has seen a 3
highly twisted and sensationalised version in the cheap newspapers, but not 3
even that has more than a fraction of the genuine terror which the original held 3
for us as we puzzled it out alone in that musty cabin among the wild hills, with 3
two monstrous stone abnormalities lurking in the death-like silence of the next 3
room. When we had finished Ben pocketed the book with a gesture half of 3
repulsion, and his first words were "Let's get out of here." 3
3
Silently and nervously we stumbled to the front of the house, unlocked the door, 3
and began the long tramp back to the village. There were many statements to 3
make and questions to answer in the days that followed, and I do not think that 3
either Ben or I can ever shake off the effects of the whole harrowing experience. 3
Neither can some of the local authorities and city reporters who flocked around - 3
even though they burned a certain book and many papers found in attic boxes, 3
and destroyed considerable apparatus in the deepest part of that sinister hillside 3
cave. But here is the text itself: 3
3
"Nov. 5 - My name is Daniel Morris. Around here they call me 'Mad Dan' 3
because I believe in powers that nobody else believes in nowadays. When I go up 3
on Thunder Hill to keep the Feast of the Foxes they think I am crazy - all except 3
the back country folks that are afraid of me. They try to stop me from sacrificing 3
the Black Goat at Hallow Eve, and always prevent my doing the Great Rite that 3
would open the gate. They ought to know better, for they know that I am a Van 3
Kauran on my mother's side, and anybody this side of the Hudson can tell what 3
the Van Kaurans have handed down. We come from Nicholas Van Kauran, the 3
wizard, who was hanged in Wijtgaart in 1587, and everybody knows he had 3
made the bargain with the Black Man. 3
3
"The soldiers never got his Book of Eibon when they burned his house, and his 3
grandson, William Van Kauran, brought it over when he came to 3
Rensselaerwyck and later crossed the river to Esopus. Ask anybody in Kingston 3
or Hurley about what the William Van Kauran line could do to people that got in 3
3
3
3
1122 3
3
3
3
their way. Also, ask them if my Uncle Hendrik didn't manage to keep hold of the 3
Book of Eibon when they ran him out of town and he went up the river to this 3
place with his family. 3
3
"I am writing this - and am going to keep writing this - because I want people to 3
know the truth after I am gone. Also, I am afraid I shall really go mad if I don't 3
set things down in plain black and white. Everything is going against me, and if 3
it keeps up I shall have to use the secrets in the Book and call in certain Powers. 3
Three months ago that sculptor Arthur Wheeler came to Mountain Top, and they 3
sent him up to me because I am the only man in the place who knows anything 3
except farming, hunting, and fleecing summer boarders. The fellow seemed to be 3
interested in what I had to say, and made a deal to stop in here for $13.00 a week 3
with meals. I gave him the back room beside the kitchen for his lumps of stone 3
and his chiselling, and arranged with Nate Williams to tend to his rock blasting 3
and haul his big pieces with a drag and yoke of oxen. 3
3
"That was three months ago. Now I know why that cursed son of hell took so 3
quick to the place. It wasn't my talk at all, but the looks of my wife Rose, that is 3
Osborne Chandler's oldest girl. She is sixteen years younger than I am, and is 3
always casting sheep's eyes at the fellows in town. But we always managed to 3
get along fine enough till this dirty rat shewed up, even if she did balk at helping 3
me with the Rites on Roodmas and Hallowmass. I can see now that Wheeler is 3
working on her feelings and getting her so fond of him that she hardly looks at 3
me, and I suppose he'll try to elope with her sooner or later. 3
3
"But he works slow like all sly, polished dogs, and I've got plenty of time to 3
think up what to do about it. They don't either of them know I suspect anything, 3
but before long they'll both realise it doesn't pay to break up a Van Kauran's 3
home. I promise them plenty of novelty in what I'll do. 3
3
"Nov. 25 - Thanksgiving Day! That's a pretty good joke! But at that I'll have 3
something to be thankful for when I finish what I've started. No question but 3
that Wheeler is trying to steal my wife. For the time being, though, I'll let him 3
keep on being a star boarder. Got the Book of Eibon down from Uncle Hendrik's 3
old trunk in the attic last week, and am looking up something good which won't 3
require sacrifices that I can't make around here. I want something that'll finish 3
these two sneaking traitors, and at the same time get me into no trouble. If it has 3
a twist of drama in it, so much the better. I've thought of calling in the emanation 3
of Yoth, but that needs a child's blood and I must be careful about the 3
neighbours. The Green Decay looks promising, but that would be a bit 3
unpleasant for me as well as for them. I don't like certain sights and smells. 3
3
3
3
1123 3
3
3
3
"Dec. 10 - Eureka! I've got the very thing at last! Revenge is sweet - and this is the 3
perfect cHmax! Wheeler, the sculptor - this is too good! Yes, indeed, that damned 3
sneak is going to produce a statue that will sell quicker than any of the things 3
he's been carving these past weeks! A realist, eh? Well - the new statuary won't 3
lack any realism! I found the formula in a manuscript insert opposite page 679 of 3
the Book. From the handwriting I judge it was put there by my great-grandfather 3
Bareut Picterse Van Kauran - the one who disappeared from New Paltz in 1839. 3
la! Shub-Niggurath! The Goat with a Thousand Young! 3
3
"To be plain, I've found a way to turn those wretched rats into stone statues. It's 3
absurdly simple, and really depends more on plain chemistry than on the Outer 3
Powers. If I can get hold of the right stuff I can brew a drink that'll pass for 3
home-made wine, and one swig ought to finish any ordinary being short of an 3
elephant. What it amounts to is a kind of petrification infinitely speeded up. 3
Shoots the whole system full of calcium and barium salts and replaces living cells 3
with mineral matter so fast that nothing can stop it. It must have been one of 3
those things great-grandfather got at the Great Sabbat on Sugar-Loaf in the 3
Catskills. Queer things used to go on there. Seems to me I heard of a man in New 3
Paltz - Squire Hasbruck - turned to stone or something like that in 1834. He was 3
an enemy of the Van Kaurans. First thing I must do is order the five chemicals I 3
need from Albany and Montreal. Plenty of time later to experiment. When 3
everything is over I'll round up all the statues and sell them as Wheeler's work to 3
pay for his overdue board bill! He always was a realist and an egoist - wouldn't 3
it be natural for him to make a self-portrait in stone, and to use my wife for 3
another model - as indeed he's really been doing for the past fortnight? Trust the 3
dull public not to ask what quarry the queer stone came from! 3
3
"Dec. 25 - Christmas. Peace on earth, and so forth! These two swine are goggling 3
at each other as if I didn't exist. They must think I'm deaf, dumb, and blind! 3
Well, the barium sulphate and calcium chloride came from Albany last 3
Thursday, and the acids, catalytics, and instruments are due from Montreal any 3
day now. The mills of the gods - and all that! I'll do the work in Allen's Cave 3
near the lower wood lot, and at the same time will be openly making some wine 3
in the cellar here. There ought to be some excuse for offering a new drink - 3
though it won't take much planning to fool those two moonstruck nincompoops. 3
The trouble will be to make Rose take wine, for she pretends not to like it. Any 3
experiments that I make on animals will be down at the cave, and nobody ever 3
thinks of going there in winter. I'll do some wood-cutting to account for my time 3
away. A small load or two brought in will keep him off the track. 3
3
"Jan. 20 - It's harder work than I thought, a lot depends on the exact proportions. 3
The stuff came from Montreal, but I had to send again for some better scales and 3
an acetylene lamp. They're getting curious down at the village. Wish the express 3

office weren't in Steenwyck's store. Am trying various mixtures on the sparrows 3
that drink and bathe in the pool in front of the cave - when it's melted. 3
Sometimes it kills them, but sometimes they fly away. Clearly, I've missed some 3
important reaction. I suppose Rose and that upstart are making the most of my 3
absence - but I can afford to let them, there can be no doubt of my success in the 3
end. 3
3
"Feb. 11 - Have got it at last! Put a fresh lot in the little pond - which is well 3
melted today - and the first bird that drank toppled over as if he were shot. I 3
picked him up a second later, and he was a perfect piece of stone, down to the 3
smallest claws and feather. Not a muscle changed since he was poised for 3
drinking, so he must have died the instant any of the stuff got to his stomach. I 3
didn't expect the petrification to come so soon. But a sparrow isn't a fair test of 3
the way the thing would act with a large animal. I must get something bigger to 3
try it on, for it must be the right strength when I give it to those swine. I guess 3
Rose's dog Rex will do. I'll take him along the next time and say a timber wolf 3
got him. she thinks a lot of him, and I shan't be sorry to give her something to 3
sniffle over before the big reckoning. I must be careful where I keep this book. 3
Rose sometimes pries around in the queerest places. 3
3
"Feb. 15 - Getting warm! Tried it on Rex and it worked like a charm with only 3
double the strength. I fixed the rock pool and got him to drink. He seemed to 3
know something queer had hit him, for he bristled and growled, but he was a 3
piece of stone before he could turn his head, the solution ought to have been 3
stronger, and for a human being ought to be very much stronger. I think I'm 3
getting the hang of it now, and am about ready for that cur Wheeler. The stuff 3
seems to be tasteless, but to make sure I'll flavour it with the new wine I'm 3
making up at the house. Wish I were surer about the tastelessness, so I could give 3
it to Rose in water without trying to urge wine on her. I'll get the two separately - 3
Wheeler out here and Rose at home. Have just fixed a strong solution and 3
cleared away all strange objects in front of the cave. Rose whimpered like a 3
puppy when I told her a wolf had got Rex, and Wheeler gurgled a lot of 3
sympathy. 3
3
"March 1 - la R'lyeh! Praise the Lord Tsathoggua! I've got the son of hell at last! 3
Told him I'd found a new ledge of friable limestone down this way, and he 3
trotted after me like the yellow cur he is! I had the wine-flavoured stuff in a 3
bottle on my hip, and he was glad of a swig when we got here. Gulped it down 3
without a wink - and dropped in his tracks before you could count three. But he 3
knows I've had my vengeance, for I made a face at him that he couldn't miss. I 3
saw the look of understanding come into his face as he keeled over. In two 3
minutes he was solid stone. 3
3
3
3
1125 3
3
3
3
"I dragged him into the cave and put Rex's figure outside again, that bristhng 3
dog shape will help to scare people off. It's getting time for the spring hunters, 3
and besides, there's a damned lunger' named Jackson in a cabin over the hill 3
who does a lot of snooping around in the snow. I wouldn't want my laboratory 3
and storeroom to be found just yet! when I got home I told Rose that Wheeler 3
had found a telegram at the village summoning him suddenly home. I don't 3
know whether she believed me or not but I doesn't matter. For form's sake, I 3
packed Wheeler's things and took them down the hill, telling her I was going to 3
ship them after him. I put them in the dry well at the abandoned Rapelye place. 3
Now for Rose! 3
3
"March 3 - Can't get Rose to drink any wine. I hope that stuff is tasteless enough 3
to go unnoticed in water. I tried it in tea and coffee, but it forms a precipitate and 3
can't be used that way. If I use it in water I'll have to cut down the dose and trust 3
to a more gradual action. Mr. and Mrs. Hoog dropped in this noon, and I had 3
hard work keeping the conversation away from Wheeler's departure. It mustn't 3
get around that we say he was called back to New York when everybody at the 3
village knows that no telegram came, and that he didn't leave on the bus. Rose is 3
acting damned queer about the whole thing. I'll have to pick a quarrel with her 3
and keep her locked in the attic. The best way is to try to make her drink that 3
doctored wine - and if she does give in, so much better. 3
3
"March 7 - Have started in on Rose. She wouldn't drink the wine so I took a 3
whip to her and drove her up to the attic. She'll never come down alive. I pass 3
her a platter of salty bread and salt meat, and a pail of slightly doctored water, 3
twice a day. The salt food ought to make her drink a lot, and it can't be long 3
before the action sets in. I don't like the way she shouts about Wheeler when I'm 3
at the door. The rest of the time she is absolutely silent. 3
3
"March 9 - It's damned peculiar how slow that stuff is in getting hold of Rose. I'll 3
have to make it stronger - probably she'll never taste it with all the salt I've been 3
feeding her. well, if it doesn't get there are plenty of other ways to fall back on. 3
but I would like to carry this neat statue plan through! Went to the cave this 3
morning and all is well there. I sometimes hear Rose's footsteps on the ceiling 3
overhead, and I think they're getting more and more dragging. The stuff is 3
certainly working, but it's too slow. Not strong enough. From now on I'll rapidly 3
stiffen up the dose. 3
3
"March 11 - It is very queer. She is still alive and moving. Tuesday night I heard 3
her piggling with a window, so went up and gave her a rawhiding. She acts 3
more sullen than frightened, and her eyes look swollen. But she could never drop 3
to the ground from that height and there's nowhere she could climb down. I 3
3
3
3
1126 3
3
3
3
have had dreams at night, for her slow, dragging pacing on the floor above gets 3
on my nerves. Sometimes I think she works at the lock on the door. 3
3
"March 15 - Still alive, despite all the strengthening of the dose. There's 3
something queer about it. she crawls now, and doesn't pace very often. But the 3
sound of her crawling is horrible. She rattles the windows, too, and fumbles with 3
the door. I shall have to finish her off with the rawhide if this keeps up. I'm 3
getting very sleepy. Wonder if Rose has got on her guard somehow. But she 3
must be drinking the stuff. This sleepiness is abnormal - I think the strain is 3
telling on me. I'm sleepy. . ." 3
3
(Here the cramped handwriting trails out in a vague scrawl, giving place to a 3
note in a firmer, evidently feminine handwriting, indicative of great emotional 3
tension.) 3
3
"March 16-4 a.m. - This is added by Rose C. Morris, about to die. Please notify 3
my father, Osborne E. Chandler, Route 2, Mountain Top, N.Y. I have just read 3
what the beast has written. I felt sure he had killed Arthur Wheeler, but did not 3
know till I read this terrible notebook. Now I know what I escaped. I noticed the 3
water tasted queer, so took none of it after the first sip. I threw it all out of the 3
window. That one sip has half paralysed me, but I can still get about. The thirst 3
was terrible, but I ate as little as possible of the salty food and was able to get a 3
little water up here under places where the roof leaked. 3
3
"There were two great rains. I thought he was trying to poison me, though I 3
didn't know what the poison was like. What he has written about himself and 3
me is a lie. We were never happy together and I think I married him only under 3
one of those spells that he was able to lay on people. I guess he hypnotised both 3
my father and me, for he was always hated and feared and suspected of dark 3
dealings with the devil. My father once called him The Devil's Kin, and he was 3
right. 3
3
"No one will ever know what I went through as his wife. It was not simply 3
common cruelty - though God knows he was cruel enough, and beat me often 3
with a leather whip. It was more - more than anyone in this age can ever 3
understand. He was a monstrous creature, and practiced all sorts of hellish 3
ceremonies handed down by his mother's people. He tried to make me help in 3
the rites - and I don't dare even hint what they were. I would not, so he beat me. 3
It would be blasphemy to tell what he tried to make me do. I can say he was a 3
murderer even then, for I know what he sacrificed one night on Thunder Hill. He 3
was surely the Devil's Kin. I tried four times to run away, but he always caught 3
and beat me. Also, he had a sort of hold over my mind, and even over my 3
father's mind. 3
3
3
3
1127 3
3
3
3
"About Arthur Wheeler I have nothing to be ashamed of. We did come to love 3
each other, but only in an honorable way. He gave me the first kind treatment I 3
had ever had since leaving my father's, and meant to help me get out of the 3
clutches of that fiend. He had several talks with my father, and was going to help 3
me get out west. After my divorce we would have been married. 3
3
"Ever since that brute locked me in the attic I have planned to get out and finish 3
him. I always kept the poison overnight in case I could escape and find him 3
asleep and give it to him somehow. At first he waked easily when I worked on 3
the lock of the door and tested the conditions at the windows, but later he began 3
to get more tired and sleep sounder. I could always tell by his snoring when he 3
asleep. 3
3
"Tonight he was so fast asleep I forced the lock without waking him. it was hard 3
work getting downstairs with my partial paralysis, but I did. I found him here 3
with the lamp burning - asleep at the table, where he had been writing in this 3
book. In the corner was the long rawhide whip he had so often beaten me with. I 3
used it to tie him to the chair so he could not move a muscle. I lashed his neck so 3
that I could pour anything down his throat without his resisting. 3
3
"He waked up just as I was finishing and I guess he saw right off that he was 3
done for. he shouted frightful things and tried to chant mystical formulas, but I 3
choked him off a dish towel from the sink. Then I saw this book he had been 3
writing in, and stopped to read it. the shock was terrible, and I almost fainted 3
four or five time. My mind was not ready for such things. After that I talked to 3
that fiend for two or three hours steady. I told everything I had wanted to tell 3
him through all the years I had been his slave, and lot of other things that had to 3
with what I read in this awful book. 3
3
"He looked almost purple when I was through, and I think he was half delirious. 3
Then I got a funnel from the cupboard and jammed it into his mouth after taking 3
out the gag. He knew what I was going to do, but was helpless. I had brought 3
down the pail of poisoned water, and without a qualm, I poured a good half of it 3
into the funnel. 3
3
"It must have been a very strong dose, for almost at once I saw that brute begin 3
to stiffen and turn a dull stony grey. In ten minutes I knew he was solid stone. I 3
could bear to touch him, but the tin funnel clinked horribly when I pulled it out 3
of his mouth. I wish I could have given that Kin of the Devil a more painful, 3
lingering death, but surely this was the most appropriate he could have had. 3
3
"There is not much more to say. I am half-paralysed, and with Arthur murdered 3
I have nothing to live for. I shall make things complete by drinking the rest of the 3
3
3
3
1128 3
3
3
3
poison after placing this book where it will be found. In a quarter of an hour I 3
shall be a stone statue. My only wish is to be buried beside the statue that was 3
Arthur - when it is found in that cave where the fiend left it. Poor trusting Rex 3
ought to lie at our feet. I do not care what becomes of the stone devil tied in the 3
chair...." 3

The Night Ocean - with R. H. Barlow 3
3
Written 1936 3
3
I went to EUston Beach not only for the pleasures of sun and ocean, but to rest a 3
weary mind. Since I knew no person in the little town, which thrives on summer 3
vacationists and presents only blank windows during most of the year, there 3
seemed no likelihood that I might be disturbed. This pleased me, for I did not 3
wish to see anything but the expanse of pounding surf and the beach lying 3
before my temporary home. 3
3
My long work of the summer was completed when I left the city, and the large 3
mural design produced by it had been entered in the contest. It had taken me the 3
bulk of the year to finish the painting, and when the last brush was cleaned I was 3
no longer reluctant to yield to the claims of health and find rest and seclusion for 3
a time. Indeed, when I had been a week on the beach I recalled only now and 3
then the work whose success had so recently seemed all-important. There was no 3
longer the old concern with a hundred complexities of colour and ornament; no 3
longer the fear and mistrust of my ability to render a mental image actual, and 3
turn by my own skill alone the dim-conceived idea into the careful draught of a 3
design. And yet that which later befell me by the lonely shore may have grown 3
solely from the mental constitution behind such concern and fear and mistrust. 3
For I have always been a seeker, a dreamer, and a ponderer on seeking and 3
dreaming; and who can say that such a nature does not open latent eyes sensitive 3
to unsuspected worlds and orders of being? 3
3
Now that I am trying to tell what I saw I am conscious of a thousand maddening 3
limitations. Things seen by the inward sight, like those flashing visions which 3
come as we drift into the blankness of sleep, are more vivid and meaningful to us 3
in that form than when we have sought to weld them with reality. Set a pen to a 3
dream, and the colour drains from it. The ink with which we write seems diluted 3
with something holding too much of reality, and we find that after all we cannot 3
delineate the incredible memory. It is as if our inward selves, released from the 3
bonds of daytime and objectivity, revelled in prisoned emotions which are 3
hastily stifled when we translate them. In dreams and visions lie the greatest 3
creations of man, for on them rests no yoke of line or hue. Forgotten scenes, and 3
lands more obscure than the golden world of childhood, spring into the sleeping 3
mind to reign until awakening puts them to rout. Amid these may be attained 3
something of the glory and contentment for which we yearn; some image of 3
sharp beauties suspected but not before revealed, which are to us as the Grail to 3
holy spirits of the medieval world. To shape these things on the wheel of art, to 3
seek to bring some faded trophy from that intangible realm of shadow and 3
3
3
3
1130 3
3
3
3
gossamer, requires equal skill and memory. For although dreams are in all of us, 3
few hands may grasp their moth-wings without tearing them. 3
3
Such skill this narrative does not have. If I might, I would reveal to you the 3
hinted events which I perceived dimly, like one who peers into an unlit realm 3
and glimpses forms whose motion is concealed. In my mural design, which then 3
lay with a multitude of others in the building for which they were planned, I had 3
striven equally to catch a trace of this elusive shadow-world, and had perhaps 3
succeeded better than I shall now succeed. My stay in Ellston was to await the 3
judging of that design; and when days of unfamiliar leisure had given me 3
perspective, I discovered that - in spite of those weaknesses which a creator 3
always detects most clearly - I had indeed managed to retain in line and colour 3
some fragments snatched from the endless world of imagining. The difficulties of 3
the process, and the resulting strain on all my powers, had undermined my 3
health and brought me to the beach during this period of waiting. Since I wished 3
to be wholly alone, I rented (to the delight of the incredulous owner) a small 3
house some distance from the village of Ellston - which, because of the waning 3
season, was alive with a moribund bustle of tourists, uniformly uninteresting to 3
me. The house, dark from the sea-wind though it had not been painted, was not 3
even a satellite of the village; but swung below it on the coast like a pendulum 3
beneath a still clock, quite alone upon a hill of weed-grown sand. Like a solitary 3
warm animal it crouched facing the sea, and its inscrutable dirty windows stared 3
upon a lonely realm of earth and sky and enormous sea. It will not do to use too 3
much imagining in a narrative whose facts, could they be augmented and fitted 3
into a mosaic, would be strange enough in themselves; but I thought the little 3
house was lonely when I saw it, and that like myself, it was conscious of its 3
meaningless nature before the great sea. 3
3
I took the place in late August, arriving a day before I was expected, and 3
encountering a van and two workingmen unloading the furniture provided by 3
the owner. I did not know then how long I would stay, and when the truck that 3
brought the goods had left I settled my small luggage and locked the door 3
(feeling very proprietary about having a house after months of a rented room) to 3
go down the weedy hill and on the beach. Since it was quite square and had but 3
one room, the house required little exploration. Two windows in each side 3
provided a great quantity of light, and somehow a door had been squeezed in as 3
an after-thought on the oceanward wall. The place had been built about ten years 3
previously, but on account of its distance from Ellston village was difficult to 3
rent even during the active summer season. There being no fireplace, it stood 3
empty and alone from October until far into the spring. Though actually less 3
than a mile below Ellston, it seemed more remote; since a bend in the coast 3
caused one to see only grassy dunes in the direction of the village. 3
3

3
3
The first day, half-gone when I was installed, I spent in the enjoyment of sun and 3
restless water-things whose quiet majesty made the designing of murals seem 3
distant and tiresome. But this was the natural reaction to a long concern with one 3
set of habits and activities. I was through with my work and my vacation was 3
begun. This fact, while elusive for the moment, showed in everything which 3
surrounded me that afternoon of my arrival, and in the utter change from old 3
scenes. There was an effect of bright sun upon a shifting sea of waves whose 3
mysteriously impelled curves were strewn with what appeared to be rhinestone. 3
Perhaps a water-colour might have caught the solid masses of intolerable light 3
which lay upon the beach where the sea mingled with the sand. Although the 3
ocean bore her own hue, it was dominated wholly and incredibly by the 3
enormous glare. There was no other person near me, and I enjoyed the spectacle 3
without the annoyance of any alien object upon the stage. Each of my senses was 3
touched in a different way, but sometimes it seemed that the roar of the sea was 3
akin to that great brightness, or as if the waves were glaring instead of the sun, 3
each of these being so vigorous and insistent that impressions coming from them 3
were mingled. Curiously, I saw no one bathing near my little square house 3
during that or succeeding afternoons, although the curving shore included a 3
wide beach even more inviting than that at the village, where the surf was dotted 3
with random figures. I supposed that this was because of the distance and 3
because there had never been other houses below the town. Why this unbuilt 3
stretch existed, I could not imagine; since many dwellings straggled along the 3
northward coast, facing the sea with aimless eyes. 3
3
I swam until the afternoon had gone, and later, having rested, walked into the 3
little town. Darkness hid the sea from me as I entered, and I found in the dingy 3
lights of the streets tokens of a life which was not even conscious of the great, 3
gloom-shrouded thing lying so close. There were painted women in tinsel 3
adornments, and bored men who were no longer young - a throng of foolish 3
marionettes perched on the lip of the ocean-chasm; unseeing, unwilling to see 3
what lay above them and about, in the multitudinous grandeur of the stars and 3
the leagues of the night ocean. I walked along that darkened sea as I went back to 3
the bare little house, sending the beams of my flashlight out upon the naked and 3
impenetrable void. In the absence of the moon, this light made a solid bar 3
athwart the walls of the uneasy tide; and I felt an indescribable emotion born of 3
the noise of the waters and the perception of my smallness as I cast that tiny 3
beam upon a realm immense in itself, yet only the black border of the earthly 3
deep. That nighted deep, upon which ships were moving alone in the darkness 3
where I could not see them, gave off the murmur of a distant, angry rabble. 3
3
When I reached my high residence I knew that I had passed no one during the 3
mile's walk from the village, and yet there somehow lingered an impression that 3
I had been all the while accompanied by the spirit of the lonely sea. It was, I 3
3
3
3
1132 3
3
3
3
thought, personified in a shape which was not revealed to me, but which moved 3
quietly about beyond my range of comprehension. It was like those actors who 3
wait behind darkened scenery in readiness for the lines which will shortly call 3
them before our eyes to move and speak in the sudden revelation of the 3
footlights. At last I shook off this fancy and sought my key to enter the place, 3
whose bare walls gave a sudden feeling of security. 3
3
My cottage was entirely free of the village, as if it had wandered down the coast 3
and was unable to return; and there I heard nothing of the disturbing clamour 3
when I returned each night after supper. I generally stayed but a short while 3
upon the streets of Ellston, though sometimes I went into the place for the sake of 3
the walk it provided. There were all the multitude of curio-shops and falsely 3
regal theatre fronts that clutter vacation towns, but I never went into these; and 3
the place seemed useful only for its restaurants. It was astonishing the number of 3
useless things people found to do. 3
3
There was a succession of sun-filled days at first. I rose early, and beheld the grey 3
sky agleam with promise of sunrise; a prophecy fulfilled as I stood witness. 3
Those dawns were cold and their colours faint in comparison to that uniform 3
radiance of day which gives to every hour the quality of white noon. That great 3
light, so apparent the first day, made each succeeding day a yellow page in the 3
book of time. I noticed that many of the beach people were displeased by the 3
inordinate sun, whereas I sought it. After grey months of toil the lethargy 3
induced by a physical existence in a region governed by the simple things - the 3
wind and light and water - had a prompt effect upon me, and since I was anxious 3
to continue this healing process, I spent all my time outdoors in the sunlight. 3
This induced a state at once impassive and submissive, and gave me a feeling of 3
security against the ravenous night. As darkness is akin to death, so is light to 3
vitality. Through the heritage of a million years ago, when men were closer to the 3
mother sea, and when the creatures of which we are born lay languid in the 3
shallow, sun-pierced water; we still seek today the primal things when we are 3
tired, steeping ourselves within their lulling security like those early half- 3
mammals which had not yet ventured upon the oozy land. 3
3
The monotony of the waves gave repose, and I had no other occupation than 3
witnessing a myriad ocean moods. There is a ceaseless change in the waters - 3
colours and shades pass over them like the insubstantial expressions of a well- 3
known face; and these are at once communicated to us by half- recognized 3
senses. When the sea is restless, remembering old ships that have gone over her 3
chasms, there comes up silently in our hearts the longing for a vanished horizon. 3
But when she forgets, we forget also. Though we know her a lifetime, she must 3
always hold an alien air, as if something too vast to have shape were lurking in 3
the universe to which she is a door. The morning ocean, glimmering with a 3
3
3
3
1133 3
3
3
3
reflected mist of blue-white cloud and expanding diamond foam, has the eyes of 3
one who ponders on strange things; and her intricately woven webs, through 3
which dart a myriad coloured fishes, hold the air of some great idle thing which 3
will arise presently from the hoary immemorial chasms and stride upon the land. 3
3
I was content for many days, and glad that I had chosen the lonely house which 3
sat like a small beast upon those rounded cliffs of sand. Among the pleasantly 3
aimless amusements fostered by such a life, I took to following the edge of the 3
tide (where the waves left a damp, irregular outline rimmed with evanescent 3
foam) for long distances; and sometimes I found curious bits of shell in the 3
chance litter of the sea. There was an astonishing lot of debris on that inward- 3
curving coast which my bare little house overlooked, and I judged that currents 3
whose courses diverge from the village beach must reach that spot. At any rate, 3
my pockets - when I had any - generally held vast stores of trash; most of which I 3
threw away an hour or two after picking it up, wondering why I had kept it. 3
Once, however, I found a small bone whose nature I could not identify, save that 3
it was certainly nothing out of a fish; and I kept this, along with a large metal 3
bead whose minutely carven design was rather unusual. This latter depicted a 3
fishy thing against a patterned background of seaweed instead of the usual floral 3
or geometrical designs, and was still clearly traceable though worn with years of 3
tossing in the surf. Since I had never seen anything like it, I judged that it 3
represented some fashion, now forgotten, of a previous year at EUston, where 3
similar fads were common. 3
3
I had been there perhaps a week when the weather began a gradual change. Each 3
stage of this progressive darkening was followed by another subtly intensified, 3
so that in the end the entire atmosphere surrounding me had shifted from day to 3
evening. This was more obvious to me in a series of mental impressions than in 3
what I actually witnessed, for the small house was lonely under the grey skies, 3
and there was sometimes a beating wind that came out of the ocean bearing 3
moisture. The sun was displaced by long intervals of cloudiness - layers of grey 3
mist beyond whose unknown depth the sun lay cut off. Though it might glare 3
with the old intensity above that enormous veil, it could not penetrate. The beach 3
was a prisoner in a hueless vault for hours at a time, as if something of the night 3
were welling into other hours. 3
3
Although the wind was invigorating and the ocean whipped into little churning 3
spirals of activity by the vagrant flapping, I found the water growing chill, so 3
that I could not stay in it as long as I had done previously, and thus I fell into the 3
habit of long walks, which - when I was unable to swim - provided the exercise 3
that I was so careful to obtain. These walks covered a greater range of sea-edge 3
than my previous wanderings, and since the beach extended in a stretch of miles 3
beyond the tawdry village, I often found myself wholly isolated upon an endless 3
3
3
3

3
3
3
area of sand as evening drew close. When this occurred, I would stride hastily 3
along the whispering sea-border, following the outline so that I should not 3
wander inland and lose my way. And sometimes, when these walks were late (as 3
they grew increasingly to be) I would come upon the crouching house that 3
looked like a harbinger of the village. Insecure upon the wind- gnawed cliffs, a 3
dark blot upon the morbid hues of the ocean sunset, it was more lonely than by 3
the full light of either orb; and seemed to my imagination like a mute, 3
questioning face turned toward me expectant of some action. That the place was 3
isolated I have said, and this at first pleased me; but in that brief evening hour 3
when the sun left a gore-splattered decline and darkness lumbered on like an 3
expanding shapeless blot, there was an alien presence about the place: a spirit, a 3
mood, an impression that came from the surging wind, the gigantic sky, and that 3
sea which drooled blackening waves upon a beach grown abruptly strange. At 3
these times I felt an uneasiness which had no very definite cause, although my 3
solitary nature had made me long accustomed to the ancient silence and the 3
ancient voice of nature. These misgivings, to which I could have put no sure 3
name, did not affect me long, yet I think now that all the while a gradual 3
consciousness of the ocean's immense loneliness crept upon me, a loneliness that 3
was made subtly horrible by intimations - which were never more than such - of 3
some animation or sentience preventing me from being wholly alone. 3
3
The noisy, yellow streets of the town, with their curiously unreal activity, were 3
very far away, and when I went there for my evening meal (mistrusting a diet 3
entirely of my own ambiguous cooking) I took increasing and quite unreasonable 3
care that I should return to the cottage before the late darkness, though I was 3
often abroad until ten or so. You will say that such action is unreasonable; that if 3
I had feared the darkness in some childish way, I would have entirely avoided it. 3
You will ask me why I did not leave the place since its loneliness was depressing 3
me. To all this I have no reply, save that whatever unrest I felt, whatever of 3
remote disturbance there was to me in brief aspects of the darkening sun or the 3
eager salt- brittle wind or in the robe of the dark sea that lay crumpled like an 3
enormous garment so close to me, was something which had an origin half in my 3
own heart, which showed itself only at fleeting moments, and which had no very 3
long effect upon me. In the recurrent days of diamond light, with sportive waves 3
flinging blue peaks at the basking shore, the memory of dark moods seemed 3
rather incredible, yet only an hour or two afterward I might again experience 3
these moods once more, and descend to a dim region of despair. 3
3
Perhaps these inward emotions were only a reflection of the sea's own mood, for 3
although half of what we see is coloured by the interpretation placed upon it by 3
our minds, many of our feelings are shaped quite distinctly by external, physical 3
things. The sea can bind us to her many moods, whispering to us by the subtle 3
token of a shadow or a gleam upon the waves, and hinting in these ways of her 3
3
3
3
1135 3
3
3
3
mournfulness or rejoicing. Always she is remembering old things, and these 3
memories, though we may not grasp them, are imparted to us, so that we share 3
her gaiety or remorse. Since I was doing no work, seeing no person that I knew, I 3
was perhaps susceptible to shades of her cryptic meaning which would have 3
been overlooked by another. The ocean ruled my life during the whole of that 3
late summer; demanding it as recompense for the healing she had brought me. 3
3
There were drownings at the beach that year; and while I heard of these only 3
casually (such is our indifference to a death which does not concern us, and to 3
which we are not witness), I knew that their details were unsavoury. The people 3
who died - some of them swimmers of a skill beyond the average - were 3
sometimes not found until many days had elapsed, and the hideous vengeance 3
of the deep had scourged their rotten bodies. It was as if the sea had dragged 3
them into a chasm-lair, and had mulled them about in the darkness until, 3
satisfied that they were no longer of any use, she had floated them ashore in a 3
ghastly state. No one seemed to know what had caused these deaths. Their 3
frequency excited alarm among the timid, since the undertow at Ellston was not 3
strong, and since there were known to be no sharks at hand. Whether the bodies 3
showed marks of any attacks I did not learn, but the dread of a death which 3
moves among the waves and comes on lone people from a lightless, motionless 3
place is a dread which men know and do not like. They must quickly find a 3
reason for such a death, even if there are no sharks. Since sharks formed only a 3
suspected cause, and one never to my knowledge confirmed, the swimmers who 3
continued during the rest of the season were on guard against treacherous tides 3
rather than against any possible sea-animal. Autumn, indeed, was not a great 3
distance off, and some people used this as an excuse for leaving the sea, where 3
men were snared by death, and going to the security of inland fields, where one 3
cannot even hear the ocean. So August ended, and I had been at the beach many 3
days. 3
3
There had been a threat of storm since the fourth of the new month, and on the 3
sixth, when I set out for a walk in the damp wind, there was a mass of formless 3
cloud, colourless and oppressive, above the ruffled leaden sea. The motion of the 3
wind, directed toward no especial goal but stirring uneasily, provided a 3
sensation of coming animation - a hint of life in the elements which might be the 3
long-expected storm. I had eaten my luncheon at Ellston, and though the 3
heavens seemed the closing lid of a great casket, I ventured far down the beach 3
and away from both the town and my no-longer-to-be-seen house. As the 3
universal grey became spotted with a carrion purple - curiously brilliant despite 3
its sombre hue - I found that I was several miles from any possible shelter. This, 3
however, did not seem very important, for despite the dark skies with their 3
added glow of unknown presage I was in a curious mood that flashed through a 3
body grown suddenly alert and sensitive to the outline of shapes and meanings 3
3
3
3
1136 3
3
3
3
that were previously dim. Obscurely, a memory came to me; suggested by the 3
likeness of the scene to one I had imagined when a story was read to me in 3
childhood. That tale - of which I had not thought for many years - concerned a 3
woman who was loved by the dark-bearded king of an underwater realm of 3
blurred cliffs where fish- things lived; and who was taken from the golden- 3
haired youth of her troth by a dark being crowned with a priest-like mitre and 3
having the features of a withered ape. What had remained in the corner of my 3
fancy was the image of cliffs beneath the water against the hueless, dusky no-sky 3
of such a realm; and this, though I had forgotten most of the story, was recalled 3
quite unexpectedly by the same pattern of cliff and sky which I then beheld. The 3
sight was similar to what I had imagined in a year now lost save for random, 3
incomplete impressions. Suggestions of this story may have lingered behind 3
certain irritating unfinished memories, and in certain values hinted to my senses 3
by scenes whose actual worth was bafflingly small. Frequently, in a momentary 3
perception, we feel that a feathery landscape (for instance), a woman's dress 3
along the curve of a road by afternoon, or the solidity of a century-defying tree 3
against the pale morning sky (the conditions more than the object being 3
significant) hold something precious, some golden virtue that we must grasp. 3
And yet when such a scene or arrangement is viewed later, or from another 3
point, we find that it has lost its value and meaning for us. Perhaps this is 3
because the thing we see does not hold that elusive quality, but only suggests to 3
the mind some very different thing which remains unremembered. The baffled 3
mind, not wholly sensing the cause of its flashing appreciation, seizes on the 3
object exciting it, and is surprised when there is nothing of worth therein. Thus it 3
was when I beheld the purpling clouds. They held the stateliness and mystery of 3
old monastery towers at twilight, but their aspect was also that of the cliffs in the 3
old fairy-tale. Suddenly reminded of this lost image, I half expected to see, in the 3
fine-spun dirty foam and among the waves which were now as if they had been 3
poured of flawed black glass, the horrid figure of that ape-faced creature, 3
wearing a mitre old with verdigris, advancing from its kingdom in some lost gulf 3
to which those waves were sky. 3
3
I did not see any such creature from the realm of imagining, but as the chill wind 3
veered, slitting the heavens like a rustling knife, there lay in the gloom of 3
merging cloud and water only a grey object, like a piece of driftwood, tossing 3
obscurely on the foam. This was a considerable distance out, and since it 3
vanished shortly, may not have been wood, but a porpoise coming to the 3
troubled surface. 3
3
I soon found that I had stayed too long contemplating the rising storm and 3
linking my early fancies with its grandeur, for an icy rain began spotting down, 3
bringing a more uniform gloom upon a scene already too dark for the hour. 3
Hurrying along the grey sand, I felt the impact of cold drops upon my back, and 3
3
3
3
1137 3
3
3
3
before many moments my clothing was soaked throughout. At first I had run, 3
put to flight by the colourless drops whose pattern hung in long linking strands 3
from an unseen sky; but after I saw that refuge was too far to reach in anything 3
like a dry state, I slackened my pace, and returned home as if I had walked under 3
clear skies. There was not much reason to hurry, although I did not idle as upon 3
previous occasions. The constraining wet garments were cold upon me, and with 3
the gathering darkness, and the wind that rose endlessly from the ocean, I could 3
not repress a shiver. Yet there was, beside the discomfort of the precipitous rain, 3
an exhilaration latent in the purplish ravelled masses of cloud and the stimulated 3
reactions of the body. In a mood half of exultant pleasure from resisting the rain 3
(which streamed from me now, and filled my shoes and pockets) and half of 3
strange appreciation of those morbid, dominant skies which hovered with dark 3
wings above the shifting eternal sea, I tramped along the grey corridor of EUston 3
Beach. More rapidly than I had expected the crouching house showed in the 3
oblique, flapping rain, and all the weeds of the sand cliff writhed in 3
accompaniment to the frantic wind, as if they would uproot themselves to join 3
the far-travelling element. Sea and sky had altered not at all, and the scene was 3
that which had accompanied me, save that there was now painted upon it the 3
hunching roof that seemed to bend from the assailing rain. I hurried up the 3
insecure steps, and let myself into a dry room, where, unconsciously surprised 3
that I was free of the nagging wind, I stood for a moment with water rilling from 3
every inch of me. 3
3
There are two windows in the front of that house, one on each side, and these 3
face nearly straight upon the ocean; which I now saw half obscured by the 3
combined veils of the rain and the imminent night. From these windows I looked 3
as I dressed myself in a motley array of dry garments seized from convenient 3
hangers and from a chair too laden to sit upon. I was prisoned on all sides by an 3
unnaturally increased dusk which had filtered down at some undefined hour 3
under cover of the fostering storm. How long I had been on the reaches of wet 3
grey sand, or what the real time was, I could not tell, though a moment's search 3
produced my watch - fortunately left behind and thus avoiding the uniform 3
wetness of my clothing. I half guessed the hour from the dimly seen hands, 3
which were only slightly less indecipherable than the surrounding figures. In 3
another moment my sight penetrated the gloom (greater in the house than 3
beyond the bleared window) and saw that it was 6:45. 3
3
There had been no one upon the beach as I came in, and naturally I expected to 3
see no further swimmers that night. Yet when I looked again from the window 3
there appeared surely to be figures blotting the grime of the wet evening. I 3
counted three moving about in some incomprehensible manner, and close to the 3
house another - which may not have been a person but a wave-ejected log, for 3
the surf was now pounding fiercely. I was startled to no little degree, and 3
3
3
3
1138 3
3
3
3
wondered for what purpose those hardy persons stayed out in such a storm. And 3
then I thought that perhaps hke myself they had been caught unintentionally in 3
the rain and had surrendered to the watery gusts. In another moment, prompted 3
by a certain civilized hospitality which overcame my love of solitude, I stepped 3
to the door and emerged momentarily (at the cost of another wetting, for the rain 3
promptly descended upon me in exultant fury) on the small porch, gesticulating 3
toward the people. But whether they did not see me, or did not understand, they 3
made no returning signal. Dim in the evening, they stood as if half*surprised, or 3
as if they awaited some other action from me. There was in their attitude 3
something of that cryptic blankness, signifying anything or nothing, which the 3
house wore about itself as seen in the morbid sunset. Abruptly there came to me 3
a feeling that a sinister quality lurked about those un-moving figures who chose 3
to stay in the rainy night upon a beach deserted by all people, and I closed the 3
door with a surge of annoyance which sought all too vainly to disguise a deeper 3
emotion of fear; a consuming fright that welled up from the shadows of my 3
consciousness. A moment later, when I had stepped to the window, there 3
seemed to be nothing outside but the portentous night. Vaguely puzzled, and 3
even more vaguely frightened - like one who has seen no alarming thing, but is 3
apprehensive of what may be found in the dark street he is soon compelled to 3
cross - I decided that I had very possibly seen no one; and that the murky air had 3
deceived me. 3
3
The aura of isolation about the place increased that night, though just out of sight 3
on the northward beach a hundred houses rose in the rainy darkness, their light 3
bleared and yellow above streets of polished glass, like goblin-eyes reflected in 3
an oily forest pool. Yet because I could not see them, or even reach them in bad 3
weather - since I had no car nor any way to leave the crouching house except by 3
walking in the figure- haunted darkness - I realized quite suddenly that I was, to 3
all intents, alone with the dreary sea that rose and subsided unseen, unkenned, 3
in the mist. And the voice of the sea had become a hoarse groan, like that of 3
something wounded which shifts about before trying to rise. 3
3
Fighting away the prevalent gloom with a soiled lamp - for the darkness crept in 3
at my windows and sat peering obscurely at me from the corners like a patient 3
animal - I prepared my food, since I had no intentions of going to the village. The 3
hour seemed incredibly advanced, though it was not yet nine o'clock when I 3
went to bed. Darkness had come early and furtively, and throughout the 3
remainder of my stay lingered evasively over each scene and action which I 3
beheld. Something had settled out of the night - something forever undefined, 3
but stirring a latent sense within me, so that I was like a beast expecting the 3
momentary rustle of an enemy. 3
3
3
3
1139 3
3
3
3
There were hours of wind, and sheets of the downpour flapped endlessly on the 3
meagre walls barring it from me. Lulls came in which I heard the mumbling sea, 3
and I could guess that large formless waves jostled one another in the pallid 3
whine of the winds, and flung on the beach a spray bitter with salt. Yet in the 3
very monotony of the restless elements I found a lethargic note, a sound that 3
beguiled me, after a time, into slumber grey and colourless as the night. The sea 3
continued its mad monologue, and the wind her nagging; but these were shut 3
out by the walls of unconsciousness, and for a time the night ocean was banished 3
from a sleeping mind. 3
3
Morning brought an enfeebled sun - a sun like that which men will see when the 3
earth is old, if there are any men left; a sun more weary than the shrouded, 3
moribund sky. Faint echo of its old image, Phoebus strove to pierce the ragged, 3
ambiguous clouds as I awoke, at moments sending a wash of pale gold rippling 3
across the northwestern interior of my house, at others waning till it was only a 3
luminous ball, like some incredible plaything forgotten on the celestial lawn. 3
After a while the falling rain - which must have continued throughout the 3
previous night - succeeded in washing away those vestiges of purple cloud 3
which had been like the ocean cliffs in an old fairy-tale. Cheated alike of the 3
setting and rising sun, that day merged with the day before, as if the intervening 3
storm had not ushered a long darkness into the world, but had swollen and 3
subsided into one long afternoon. Gaining heart, the furtive sun exerted all his 3
force in dispelling the old mist, streaked now like a dirty window, and cast it 3
from his realm. The shallow blue day advanced as those grimy wisps retreated, 3
and the loneliness which had encircled me welled back into a watchful place of 3
retreat, whence it went no farther, but crouched and waited. 3
3
The ancient brightness was now once more upon the sun, and the old glitter on 3
the waves, whose playful blue shapes had flocked upon that coast ere man was 3
born, and would rejoice unseen when he was forgotten in the sepulchre of time. 3
Influenced by these thin assurances, like one who believes the smile of friendship 3
on an enemy's features, I opened my door, and as it swung outward, a black spot 3
upon the inward burst of light, I saw the beach washed clean of any track, as if 3
no foot before mine had disturbed the smooth sand. With the quick lift of spirit 3
that follows a period of uneasy depression, I felt - in a purely yielding fashion 3
and without volition - that my own memory was washed clean of all the mistrust 3
and suspicion and disease-like fear of a lifetime, just as the filth of the water's 3
edge succumbs to a particularly high tide and is carried out of sight. There was a 3
scent of soaked, brackish grass, like the mouldy pages of a book, commingled 3
with a sweet odour born of the hot sunlight upon inland meadows, and these 3
were borne into me like an exhilarating drink, seeping and tingling through my 3
veins as if they would convey to me something of their own impalpable nature, 3
and float me dizzily in the aimless breeze. And conspiring with these things, the 3
3
3
3
1140 3
3
3
3
sun continued to shower upon me, like the rain of yesterday, an incessant array 3
of bright spears; as if it also wished to hide that suspected background presence 3
which moved beyond my sight and was betrayed only by a careless rustle on the 3
borders of my consciousness, or by the aspect of blank figures staring out of an 3
ocean void. That sun, a fierce ball solitary in the whirlpool of infinity, was like a 3
horde of golden moths against my upturned face. A bubbling white grail of fire 3
divine and incomprehensible, it withheld from me a thousand promised mirages 3
where it granted one. For the sun did actually seem to indicate realms, secure 3
and fanciful, where if I but knew the path I might wander in this curious 3
exultation. Such things come of our own natures, for life has never yielded for 3
one moment her secrets, and it is only in our interpretation of their hinted images 3
that we may find ecstasy or dullness, according to a deliberately induced mood. 3
Yet ever and again we must succumb to her deceptions, believing for the 3
moment that we may this time find the withheld joy. And in this way the fresh 3
sweetness of the wind, on a morning following the haunted darkness (whose evil 3
intimations had given me a greater uneasiness than any menace to my body), 3
whispered to me of ancient mysteries only half-linked with earth, and of 3
pleasures that were the sharper because I felt that I might experience only a part 3
of them. The sun and wind and that scent that rose upon them told me of 3
festivals of gods whose senses are a millionfold more poignant than man's and 3
whose joys are a millionfold more subtle and prolonged. These things, they 3
hinted, could be mine if I gave myself wholly into their bright deceptive power; 3
and the sun, a crouching god with naked celestial flesh, an unknown, too-mighty 3
furnace upon which no eye might look, seemed almost sacred in the glow of my 3
newly sharpened emotions. The ethereal thunderous light it gave was something 3
before which all things must worship astonished. The slinking leopard in his 3
green- chasmed forest must have paused briefly to consider its leaf-scattered 3
rays, and all things nurtured by it must have cherished its bright message on 3
such a day. For when it is absent in the far reaches of eternity, earth will be lost 3
and black against an illimitable void. That morning, in which I shared the fire of 3
life, and whose brief moment of pleasure is secure against the ravenous years, 3
was astir with the beckoning of strange things whose elusive names can never be 3
written. 3
3
As I made my way toward the village, wondering how it might look after a long- 3
needed scrubbing by the industrious rain, I saw, tangled in a glimmer of sunlit 3
moisture that was poured over it like a yellow vintage, a small object like a hand, 3
some twenty feet ahead of me, and touched by the repetitious foam. The shock 3
and disgust born in my startled mind when I saw that it was indeed a piece of 3
rotten flesh overcame my new contentment, and engendered a shocked suspicion 3
that it might actually be a hand. Certainly, no fish, or part of one, could assume 3
that look, and I thought I saw mushy fingers wed in decay. I turned the thing 3
over with my foot, not wishing to touch so foul an object, and it adhered stickily 3
3
3
3
1141 3
3
3
3
to the leather of the shoe, as if clutching with the grasp of corruption. The thing, 3
whose shape was nearly lost, held too much resemblance to what I feared it 3
might be, and I pushed it into the willing grasp of a seething wave, which took it 3
from sight with an alacrity not often shown by those ravelled edges of the sea. 3
3
Perhaps I should have reported my find, yet its nature was too ambiguous to 3
make action natural. Since it had been partly eaten by some ocean-dwelling 3
monstrousness, I did not think it identifiable enough to form evidence of an 3
unknown but possible tragedy. The numerous drownings, of course, came into 3
my mind - as well as other things lacking in wholesomeness, some of which 3
remained only as possibilities. Whatever the storm-dislodged fragment may 3
have been, and whether it were fish or some animal akin to man, I have never 3
spoken of it until now. And after all, there was no proof that it had not merely 3
been distorted by rottenness into that shape. 3
3
I approached the town, sickened by the presence of such an object amid the 3
apparent beauty of the clean beach, though it was horribly typical of the 3
indifference of death in a nature which mingles rottenness with beauty, and 3
perhaps loves the former more. In Ellston I heard of no recent drowning or other 3
mishap of the sea, and found no reference to such in the columns of the local 3
paper - the only one I read during my stay. 3
3
It is difficult to describe the mental state in which succeeding days found me. 3
Always susceptible to morbid emotions whose dark anguish might be induced 3
by things outside myself, or might spring from the abysses of my own spirit, I 3
was ridden by a feeling which was not fear or despair, or anything akin to these, 3
but was rather a perception of the brief hideousness and underlying filth of life - 3
a feeling partly a reflection of my internal nature and partly a result of breedings 3
induced by that gnawed rotten object which may have been a hand. In those 3
days my mind was a place of shadowed cliffs and dark moving figures, like the 3
ancient unsuspected realm which the fairy-tale recalled to me. I felt, in brief 3
agonies of disillusionment, the gigantic blackness of this overwhelming universe, 3
in which my days and the days of my race were as nothing to the shattered stars; 3
a universe in which each action is vain and even the emotion of grief a wasted 3
thing. 3
3
The hours I had previously spent in something of regained health, contentment, 3
and physical well-being were given now (as if those days of the previous week 3
were something definitely ended) to an indolence like that of a man who no 3
longer cares to live. I was engulfed by a piteous lethargic fear of some ineluctable 3
doom which would be, I felt, the completed hate of the peering stars and of the 3
black enormous waves that hoped to clasp my bones within them - the 3
vengeance of all the indifferent, horrendous majesty of the night ocean. 3
3
3
3
1142 3
3
3
3
Something of the darkness and restlessness of the sea had penetrated my heart, 3
so that I hved in an unreasoning, unperceiving torment; a torment none the less 3
acute because of the subtlety of its origin and the strange, unmotivated quality of 3
its vampiric existence. Before my eyes lay the phantasmagoria of the purpling 3
clouds, the strange silver bauble, the recurrent stagnant foam, the loneliness of 3
that bleak-eyed house, and the mockery of the puppet town. I no longer went to 3
the village, for it seemed only a travesty of life. Like my own soul, it stood upon 3
a dark enveloping sea - a sea grown slowly hateful to me. And among these 3
images, corrupt and festering, dwelt that of an object whose human contours left 3
ever smaller the doubt of what it once had been. 3
3
These scribbled words can never tell of the hideous loneliness (something I did 3
not even wish assuaged, so deeply was it embedded in my heart) which had 3
insinuated itself within me, mumbling of terrible and unknown things stealthily 3
circling nearer. It was not a madness: rather was it a too clear and naked 3
perception of the darkness beyond this frail existence, lit by a momentary sun no 3
more secure than ourselves; a realization of futility that few can experience and 3
ever again touch the life about them; a knowledge that turn as I might, battle as I 3
might with all the remaining power of my spirit, I could neither win an inch of 3
ground from the inimical universe, nor hold for even a moment the life entrusted 3
to me. Fearing death as I did life, burdened with a nameless dread, yet unwilling 3
to leave the scene evoking it, I awaited whatever consummating horror was 3
shifting itself in the immense region beyond the walls of consciousness. 3
3
Thus autumn found me, and what I had gained from the sea was lost back into it. 3
Autumn on the beaches - a drear time betokened by no scarlet leaf nor any other 3
accustomed sign. A frightening sea which changes not, though man changes. 3
There was only a chilling of the waters, in which I no longer cared to enter - a 3
further darkening of the pall-like sky, as if eternities of snow were waiting to 3
descend upon the ghastly waves. Once that descent began, it would never cease, 3
but would continue beneath the white and the yellow and the crimson sun, and 3
beneath that ultimate small ruby which shall yield only to the futilities of night. 3
The once friendly waters babbled meaningfully at me, and eyed me with a 3
strange regard, yet whether the darkness of the scene were a reflection of my 3
own breedings or whether the gloom within me were caused by what lay 3
without, I could not have told. Upon the beach and me alike had fallen a shadow, 3
like that of a bird which flies silently overhead - a bird whose watching eyes we 3
do not suspect till the image on the ground repeats the image in the sky, and we 3
look suddenly upward to find that something has been circling above us hitherto 3
unseen. 3
3
The day was in late September, and the town had closed the resorts where mad 3
frivolity ruled empty, fear- haunted lives, and where raddled puppets performed 3
3
3
3
1143 3
3
3
3
their summer antics. The puppets were cast aside, smeared with the painted 3
smiles and frowns they had last assumed, and there were not a hundred people 3
left in the town. Again the gaudy, stucco-fronted buildings lining the shore were 3
permitted to crumble undisturbed in the wind. As the month advanced to the 3
day of which I speak, there grew in me the light of a grey infernal dawn, wherein 3
I felt some dark thaumaturgy would be completed. Since I feared such a 3
thaumaturgy less than a continuance of my horrible suspicions -less than the 3
too-elusive hints of something monstrous lurking behind the great stage - it was 3
with more speculation than actual fear that I waited unendingly for the day of 3
horror which seemed to be nearing. The day, I repeat, was late in September, 3
though whether the 22nd or 23rd I am uncertain. Such details have fled before 3
the recollection of those uncompleted happenings - episodes with which no 3
orderly existence should be plagued, because of the damnable suggestions (and 3
only suggestions) they contain. I knew the time with an intuitive distress of spirit 3
- a recognition too deep for me to explain. Throughout those daylight hours I 3
was expectant of the night; impatient, perhaps, so that the sunlight passed like a 3
half-glimpsed reflection in rippled water - a day of whose events I recall nothing. 3
3
It was long since that portentous storm had cast a shadow over the beach, and I 3
had determined, after hesitations caused by nothing tangible, to leave EUston, 3
since the year was chilling and there was no return to my earlier contentment. 3
When a telegram came for me (lying two days in the Western Union office before 3
I was located, so little was my name known) saying that my design had been 3
accepted - winning above all others in the contest - 1 set a date for leaving. This 3
news, which earlier in the year would have affected me strongly, I now received 3
with a curious apathy. It seemed as unrelated to the unreality about me, as little 3
pertinent to me, as if it were directed to another person whom I did not know, 3
and whose message had come to me through some accident. None the less, it was 3
that which forced me to complete my plans and leave the cottage by the shore. 3
3
There were only four nights of my stay remaining when there occurred the last of 3
those events whose meaning lies more in the darkly sinister impression 3
surrounding them than in anything obviously threatening. Night had settled 3
over Ellston and the coast, and a pile of soiled dishes attested both to my recent 3
meal and to my lack of industry. Darkness came as I sat with a cigarette before 3
the seaward window, and it was a liquid which gradually filled the sky, washing 3
in a floating moon, monstrously elevated. The flat sea bordering upon the 3
gleaming sand, the utter absence of tree or figure or life of any sort, and the 3
regard of that high moon made the vastness of my surroundings abruptly clear. 3
There were only a few stars pricking through, as if to accentuate by their 3
smallness the majesty of the lunar orb and of the restless shifting tide. 3
3

3
3
3
I had stayed indoors, fearing somehow to go out before the sea on such a night of 3
shapeless portent, but I heard it mumbhng secrets of an incredible lore. Borne to 3
me on a wind out of nowhere was the breath of some strange palpitant life - the 3
embodiment of all I had felt and of all I had suspected - stirring now in the 3
chasms of the sky or beneath the mute waves. In what place this mystery turned 3
from an ancient, horrible slumber I could not tell, but like one who stands by a 3
figure lost in sleep, knowing that it will awake in a moment, I crouched by the 3
window, holding a nearly burnt-out cigarette, and faced the rising moon. 3
3
Gradually there passed into that never-stirring landscape a brilliance intensified 3
by the overhead glimmerings, and I seemed more and more under some 3
compulsion to watch whatever might follow. The shadows were draining from 3
the beach, and I felt that with them were all which might have been a harbour for 3
my thoughts when the hinted thing should come. Where any of them did remain 3
they were ebon and blank: still lumps of darkness sprawling beneath the cruel 3
brilliant rays. The endless tableau of the lunar orb - dead now, whatever her past 3
was, and cold as the unhuman sepulchres she bears amid the ruin of dusty 3
centuries older than men - and the sea - astir, perhaps, with some unkenned life, 3
some forbidden sentience - confronted me with a horrible vividness. I arose and 3
shut the window; partly because of an inward prompting, but mostly, I think, as 3
an excuse for transferring momentarily the stream of thought. No sound came to 3
me now as I stood before the closed panes. Minutes or eternities were alike. I was 3
waiting, like my own fearing heart and the motionless scene beyond, for the 3
token of some ineffable life. I had set the lamp upon a box in the western corner 3
of the room, but the moon was brighter, and her bluish rays invaded places 3
where the lamplight was faint. The ancient glow of the round silent orb lay upon 3
the beach as it had lain for aeons, and I waited in a torment of expectancy made 3
doubly acute by the delay in fulfillment and the uncertainty of what strange 3
completion was to come. 3
3
Outside the crouching hut a white illumination suggested vague spectral forms 3
whose unreal, phantasmal motions seemed to taunt my blindness, just as 3
unheard voices mocked my eager listening. For countless moments I was still, as 3
if Time and the tolling of her great bell were hushed into nothingness. And yet 3
there was nothing which I might fear: the moon-chiselled shadows were 3
unnatural in no contour, and veiled nothing from my eyes. The night was silent - 3
I knew that despite my closed window - and all the stars were fixed mournfully 3
in a listening heaven of dark grandeur. No motion from me then, or word now, 3
could reveal my plight, or tell of the fear-racked brain imprisoned in flesh which 3
dared not break the silence, for all the torture it brought. As if expectant of death, 3
and assured that nothing could serve to banish the soul-peril I confronted I 3
crouched with a forgotten cigarette in my hand. A silent world gleamed beyond 3
the cheap, dirty windows, and in one corner of the room a pair of dirty oars. 3
3
3
3
1145 3
3
3
3
placed there before my arrival, shared the vigil of my spirit. The lamp burned 3
endlessly, yielding a sick light hued like a corpse's flesh. Glancing at it now and 3
again for the desperate distraction it gave, I saw that many bubbles 3
unaccountably rose and vanished in the kerosene-filled base. Curiously enough, 3
there was no heat from the wick. And suddenly I became aware that the night as 3
a whole was neither warm nor cold, but strangely neutral - as if all physical 3
forces were suspended, and all the laws of a calm existence disrupted. 3
3
Then, with an unheard splash which sent from the silver water to the shore a line 3
of ripples echoed in fear by my heart, a swimming thing emerged beyond the 3
breakers. The figure may have been that of a dog, a human being, or something 3
more strange. It could not have known that I watched - perhaps it did not care - 3
but like a distorted fish it swam across the mirrored stars and dived beneath the 3
surface. After a moment it came up again, and this time, since it was closer, I saw 3
that it was carrying something across its shoulder. I knew, then, that it could be 3
no animal, and that it was a man or something like a man, which came toward 3
the land from a dark ocean. But it swam with a horrible ease. 3
3
As I watched, dread-filled and passive, with the fixed stare of one who awaits 3
death in another yet knows he cannot avert it, the swimmer approached the 3
shore - though too far down the southward beach for me to discern its outlines or 3
features. Obscurely loping, with sparks of moonlit foam scattered by its quick 3
gait, it emerged and was lost among the inland dunes. 3
3
Now I was possessed by a sudden recurrence of fear, which had died away in the 3
previous moments. There was a tingling coldness all over me - though the room, 3
whose window I dared not open now, was stuffy. I thought it would be very 3
horrible if something were to enter a window which was not closed. 3
3
Now that I could no longer see the figure, I felt that it lingered somewhere in the 3
close shadows, or peered hideously at me from whatever window I did not 3
watch. And so I turned my gaze, eagerly and frantically, to each successive pane; 3
dreading that I might indeed behold an intrusive regarding face, yet unable to 3
keep myself from the terrifying inspection. But though I watched for hours, there 3
was no longer anything upon the beach. 3
3
So the night passed, and with it began the ebbing of that strangeness - a 3
strangeness which had surged up like an evil brew within a pot, had mounted to 3
the very rim in a breathless moment, had paused uncertainly there, and had 3
subsided, taking with it whatever unknown message it had borne. Like the stars 3
that promise the revelation of terrible and glorious memories, goad us into 3
worship by this deception, and then impart nothing, I had come frighteningly 3
near to the capture of an old secret which ventured close to man's haunts and 3
3
3
3
1146 3
3
3
3
lurked cautiously just beyond the edge of the known. Yet in the end I had 3
nothing. I was given only a glimpse of the furtive thing; a glimpse made obscure 3
by the veils of ignorance. I cannot even conceive what might have shown itself 3
had I been too close to that swimmer who went shoreward instead of into the 3
ocean. I do not know what might have come if the brew had passed the rim of 3
the pot and poured outward in a swift cascade of revelation. The night ocean 3
withheld whatever it had nurtured. I shall know nothing more. 3
3
Even yet I do not know why the ocean holds such a fascination for me. But then, 3
perhaps none of us can solve those things - they exist in defiance of all 3
explanation. There are men, and wise men, who do not like the sea and its 3
lapping surf on yellow shores; and they think us strange who love the mystery of 3
the ancient and unending deep. Yet for me there is a haunting and inscrutable 3
glamour in all the ocean's moods. It is in the melancholy silver foam beneath the 3
moon's waxen corpse; it hovers over the silent and eternal waves that beat on 3
naked shores; it is there when all is lifeless save for unknown shapes that glide 3
through sombre depths. And when I behold the awesome billows surging in 3
endless strength, there comes upon me an ecstasy akin to fear; so that I must 3
abase myself before this mightiness, that I may not hate the clotted waters and 3
their overwhelming beauty. 3
3
Vast and lonely is the ocean, and even as all things came from it, so shall they 3
return thereto. In the shrouded depths of time none shall reign upon the earth, 3
nor shall any motion be, save in the eternal waters. And these shall beat on dark 3
shores in thunderous foam, though none shall remain in that dying world to 3
watch the cold light of the enfeebled moon playing on the swirling tides and 3
coarse-grained sand. On the deep's margin shall rest only a stagnant foam, 3
gathering about the shells and bones of perished shapes that dwelt within the 3
waters. Silent, flabby things will toss and roll along empty shores, their sluggish 3
life extinct. Then all shall be dark, for at last even the white moon on the distant 3
waves shall wink out. Nothing shall be left, neither above nor below the sombre 3
waters. And until that last millennium, and beyond the perishing of all other 3
things, the sea will thunder and toss throughout the dismal night. 3

The Thing in the Moonlight - with J. 3
Chapman Miske 3
3
Written November 24, 1927 3
3
The following is based, in places word for word, on a letter Lovecraft wrote to 3
Donald Wandrei on November 24, 1927. The first three and last five paragraphs 3
were added by J. Chapman Miske; the remainder is almost verbatim Lovecraft. 3
3
In the letter, Lovecraft reveals that his "dreams occasionally approach'd the 3
phantastical in character, tho' falling somewhat short of coherence." Many of his 3
stories were inspired by dreams. 3
3
Morgan is not a literary man; in fact he cannot speak English with any degree of 3
coherency. That is what makes me wonder about the words he wrote, though 3
others have laughed. 3
3
He was alone the evening it happened. Suddenly an unconquerable urge to write 3
came over him, and taking pen in hand he wrote the following: 3
3
My name is Howard Phillips. I live at 66 College Street, in Providence, Rhode 3
Island. On November 24, 1927-for I know not even what the year may be now-, I 3
fell asleep and dreamed, since when I have been unable to awaken. 3
3
My dream began in a dank, reed-choked marsh that lay under a gray autumn 3
sky, with a rugged cliff of lichen-crusted stone rising to the north. Impelled by 3
some obscure quest, I ascended a rift or cleft in this beetling precipice, noting as I 3
did so the black mouths of many fearsome burrows extending from both walls 3
into the depths of the stony plateau. 3
3
At several points the passage was roofed over by the choking of the upper parts 3
of the narrow fissure; these places being exceeding dark, and forbidding the 3
perception of such burrows as may have existed there. In one such dark space I 3
felt conscious of a singular accession of fright, as if some subtle and bodiless 3
emanation from the abyss were engulfing my spirit; but the blackness was too 3
great for me to perceive the source of my alarm. 3
3
At length I emerged upon a tableland of moss-grown rock and scanty soil, lit by 3
a faint moonlight which had replaced the expiring orb of day. Casting my eyes 3
about, I beheld no living object; but was sensible of a very peculiar stirring far 3
below me, amongst the whispering rushes of the pestilential swamp I had lately 3
quitted. 3
3
3
3
1148 3
3
3
3
After walking for some distance, I encountered the rusty tracks of a street 3
railway, and the worm-eaten poles which still held the limp and sagging trolley 3
wire. Following this line, I soon came upon a yellow, vestibuled car numbered 3
1852-of a plain, double-trucked type common from 1900 to 1910. It was 3
untenanted, but evidently ready to start; the trolley being on the wire and the air- 3
brake now and then throbbing beneath the floor. I boarded it and looked vainly 3
about for the light switch-noting as I did so the absence of the controller handle, 3
which thus implied the brief absence of the motorman. Then I sat down in one of 3
the cross seats of the vehicle. Presently I heard a swishing in the sparse grass 3
toward the left, and saw the dark forms of two men looming up in the 3
moonlight. They had the regulation caps of a railway company, and I could not 3
doubt but that they were conductor and motorman. Then one of them sniffed 3
with singular sharpness, and raised his face to howl to the moon. The other 3
dropped on all fours to run toward the car. 3
3
I leaped up at once and raced madly out of that car and across endless leagues of 3
plateau till exhaustion forced me to stop-doing this not because the conductor 3
had dropped on all fours, but because the face of the motorman was a mere 3
white cone tapering to one blood- red- tentacle. . . 3
3
I was aware that I only dreamed, but the very awareness was not pleasant. Since 3
that fearful night, I have prayed only for awakening-it has not come! 3
3
Instead I have found myself an inhabitant of this terrible dream-world! That first 3
night gave way to dawn, and I wandered aimlessly over the lonely swamp-lands. 3
When night came, I still wandered, hoping for awakening. But suddenly I parted 3
the weeds and saw before me the ancient railway car-and to one side a cone- 3
faced thing lifted its head and in the streaming moonlight howled strangely! 3
3
It has been the same each day. Night takes me always to that place of horror. I 3
have tried not moving, with the coming of nightfall, but I must walk in my 3
slumber, for always I awaken with the thing of dread howling before me in the 3
pale moonlight, and I turn and flee madly. 3
3
God! when will I awaken? 3
3
That is what Morgan wrote. I would go to 66 College Street in Providence, but I 3
fear for what I might find there. 3

The Trap - with Henry S. Whitehead 3
3
Written late 1931 3
3
It was on a certain Thursday morning in December that the whole thing began 3
with that unaccountable motion I thought I saw in my antique Copenhagen 3
mirror. Something, it seemed to me, stirred - something reflected in the glass, 3
though I was alone in my quarters. I paused and looked intently, then, deciding 3
that the effect must be a pure illusion, resumed the interrupted brushing of my 3
hair. 3
3
I had discovered the old mirror, covered with dust and cobwebs, in an 3
outbuilding of an abandoned estate- house in Santa Cruz's sparsely settled 3
Northside territory, and had brought it to the United States from the Virgin 3
Islands. The venerable glass was dim from more than two hundred years' 3
exposure to a tropical climate, and the graceful ornamentation along the top of 3
the gilt frame had been badly smashed. I had had the detached pieces set back 3
into the frame before placing it in storage with my other belongings. 3
3
Now, several years later, I was staying half as a guest and half as a tutor at the 3
private school of my old friend Browne on a windy Connecticut hillside - 3
occupying an unused wing in one of the dormitories, where I had two rooms and 3
a hallway to myself. The old mirror, stowed securely in mattresses, was the first 3
of my possessions to be unpacked on my arrival; and I had set it up majestically 3
in the living-room, on top of an old rosewood console which had belonged to my 3
great-grandmother. 3
3
The door of my bedroom was just opposite that of the living-room, with a 3
hallway between; and I had noticed that by looking into my chiffonier glass I 3
could see the larger mirror through the two doorways - which was exactly like 3
glancing down an endless, though diminishing, corridor. On this Thursday 3
morning I thought I saw a curious suggestion of motion down that normally 3
empty corridor - but, as I have said, soon dismissed the notion. 3
3
When I reached the dining-room I found everyone complaining of the cold, and 3
learned that the school's heating-plant was temporarily out of order. Being 3
especially sensitive to low temperatures, I was myself an acute sufferer; and at 3
once decided not to brave any freezing schoolroom that day. Accordingly I 3
invited my class to come over to my living-room for an informal session around 3
my grate-fire - a suggestion which the boys received enthusiastically. 3
3
3
3
1150 3
3
3
3
After the session one of the boys, Robert Grandison, asked if he might remain; 3
since he had no appointment for the second morning period. I told him to stay, 3
and welcome. He sat down to study in front of the fireplace in a comfortable 3
chair. 3
3
It was not long, however, before Robert moved to another chair somewhat 3
farther away from the freshly replenished blaze, this change bringing him 3
directly opposite the old mirror. From my own chair in another part of the room 3
I noticed how fixedly he began to look at the dim, cloudy glass, and, wondering 3
what so greatly interested him, was reminded of my own experience earlier that 3
morning. As time passed he continued to gaze, a slight frown knitting his brows. 3
3
At last I quietly asked him what had attracted his attention. Slowly, and still 3
wearing the puzzled frown, he looked over and replied rather cautiously: 3
3
"It's the corrugations in the glass - or whatever they are, Mr. Canevin. I was 3
noticing how they all seem to run from a certain point. Look - I'll show you what 3
I mean." 3
3
The boy jumped up, went over to the mirror, and placed his finger on a point 3
near its lower left-hand corner. 3
3
"It's right here, sir," he explained, turning to look toward me and keeping his 3
finger on the chosen spot. 3
3
His muscular action in turning may have pressed his finger against the glass. 3
Suddenly he withdrew his hand as though with some slight effort, and with a 3
faintly muttered "Ouch." Then he looked at the glass in obvious mystification. 3
3
"What happened?" I asked, rising and approaching. 3
3
"Why - it..." He seemed embarrassed. "It - I - felt - well, as though it were 3
pulling my finger into it. Seems - er - perfectly foolish, sir, but - well - it was a 3
most peculiar sensation." Robert had an unusual vocabulary for his fifteen years. 3
3
I came over and had him show me the exact spot he meant. 3
3
"You'll think I'm rather a fool, sir," he said shamefacedly, "but - well, from right 3
here I can't be absolutely sure. From the chair it seemed to be clear enough." 3
3
Now thoroughly interested, I sat down in the chair Robert had occupied and 3
looked at the spot he selected on the mirror. Instantly the thing "jumped out at 3
me." Unmistakably, from that particular angle, all the many whorls in the 3
3
3
3
1151 3
3
3
3
ancient glass appeared to converge like a large number of spread strings held in 3
one hand and radiating out in streams. 3
3
Getting up and crossing to the mirror, I could no longer see the curious spot. 3
Only from certain angles, apparently, was it visible. Directly viewed, that portion 3
of the mirror did not even give back a normal reflection - for I could not see my 3
face in it. Manifestly I had a minor puzzle on my hands. 3
3
Presently the school gong sounded, and the fascinated Robert Grandison 3
departed hurriedly, leaving me alone with my odd little problem in optics. I 3
raised several window-shades, crossed the hallway, and sought for the spot in 3
the chiffonier mirror's reflection. Finding it readily, I looked very intently and 3
thought I again detected something of the "motion." I craned my neck, and at 3
last, at a certain angle of vision, the thing again "jumped out at me." 3
3
The vague "motion" was now positive and definite - an appearance of torsional 3
movement, or of whirling; much like a minute yet intense whirlwind or 3
waterspout, or a huddle of autumn leaves dancing circularly in an eddy of wind 3
along a level lawn. It was, like the earth's, a double motion - around and around, 3
and at the same time inward, as if the whorls poured themselves endlessly 3
toward some point inside the glass. Fascinated, yet realizing that the thing must 3
be an illusion, I grasped an impression of quite distinct suction, and thought of 3
Robert's embarrassed explanation: "I felt as though it were pulling my finger 3
into it." 3
3
A kind of slight chill ran suddenly up and down my backbone. There was 3
something here distinctly worth looking into. And as the idea of investigation 3
came to me, I recalled the rather wistful expression of Robert Grandison when 3
the gong called him to class. I remembered how he had looked back over his 3
shoulder as he walked obediently out into the hallway, and resolved that he 3
should be included in whatever analysis I might make of this little mystery. 3
3
Exciting events connected with that same Robert, however, were soon to chase 3
all thoughts of the mirror from my consciousness for a time. I was away all that 3
afternoon, and did not return to the school until the five-fifteen "Call-Over" - a 3
general assembly at which the boys' attendance was compulsory. Dropping in at 3
this function with the idea of picking Robert up for a session with the mirror, I 3
was astonished and pained to find him absent - a very unusual and 3
unaccountable thing in his case. That evening Browne told me that the boy had 3
actually disappeared, a search in his room, in the gymnasium, and in all other 3
accustomed places being unavailing, though all his belongings - including his 3
outdoor clothing - were in their proper places. 3
3
3
3
1152 3
3
3
3
He had not been encountered on the ice or with any of the hiking groups that 3
afternoon, and telephone calls to all the school-catering merchants of the 3
neighborhood were in vain. There was, in short, no record of his having been 3
seen since the end of the lesson periods at two-fifteen; when he had turned up 3
the stairs toward his room in Dormitory Number Three. 3
3
When the disappearance was fully realized, the resulting sensation was 3
tremendous throughout the school. Browne, as headmaster, had to bear the 3
brunt of it; and such an unprecedented occurrence in his well- regulated, highly 3
organized institution left him quite bewildered. It was learned that Robert had 3
not run away to his home in western Pennsylvania, nor did any of the searching- 3
parties of boys and masters find any trace of him in the snowy countryside 3
around the school. So far as could be seen, he had simply vanished. 3
3
Robert's parents arrived on the afternoon of the second day after his 3
disappearance. They took their trouble quietly, though, of course, they were 3
staggered by this unexpected disaster. Browne looked ten years older for it, but 3
there was absolutely nothing that could be done. By the fourth day the case had 3
settled down in the opinion of the school as an insoluble mystery. Mr. and Mrs. 3
Grandison went reluctantly back to their home, and on the following morning 3
the ten days' Christmas vacation began. 3
3
Boys and masters departed in anything but the usual holiday spirit; and Browne 3
and his wife were left, along with the servants, as my only fellow-occupants of 3
the big place. Without the masters and boys it seemed a very hollow shell 3
indeed. 3
3
That afternoon I sat in front of my grate-fire thinking about Robert's 3
disappearance and evolving all sorts of fantastic theories to account for it. By 3
evening I had acquired a bad headache, and ate a light supper accordingly. Then, 3
after a brisk walk around the massed buildings, I returned to my living-room 3
and took up the burden of thought once more. 3
3
A little after ten o'clock I awakened in my armchair, stiff and chilled, from a doze 3
during which I had let the fire go out. I was physically uncomfortable, yet 3
mentally aroused by a peculiar sensation of expectancy and possible hope. Of 3
course it had to do with the problem that was harassing me. For I had started 3
from that inadvertent nap with a curious, persistent idea - the odd idea that a 3
tenuous, hardly recognizable Robert Grandison had been trying desperately to 3
communicate with me. I finally went to bed with one conviction unreasoningly 3
strong in my mind. Somehow I was sure that young Robert Grandison was still 3
alive. 3
3
3
3
1153 3
3
3
3
That I should be receptive of such a notion will not seem strange to those who 3
know my long residence in the West Indies and my close contact with 3
unexplained happenings there. It will not seem strange, either, that I fell asleep 3
with an urgent desire to establish some sort of mental communication with the 3
missing boy. Even the most prosaic scientists affirm, with Freud, Jung, and 3
Adler, that the subconscious mind is most open to external impressions in sleep; 3
though such impressions are seldom carried over intact into the waking state. 3
3
Going a step further and granting the existence of telepathic forces, it follows 3
that such forces must act most strongly on a sleeper; so that if I were ever to get a 3
definite message from Robert, it would be during a period of profoundest 3
slumber. Of course, I might lose the message in waking; but my aptitude for 3
retaining such things has been sharpened by types of mental discipline picked up 3
in various obscure corners of the globe. 3
3
I must have dropped asleep instantaneously, and from the vividness of my 3
dreams and the absence of wakeful intervals I judge that my sleep was a very 3
deep one. It was six-forty-five when I awakened, and there still lingered with me 3
certain impressions which I knew were carried over from the world of somnolent 3
cerebration. Filling my mind was the vision of Robert Grandison strangely 3
transformed to a boy of a dull greenish dark-blue color; Robert desperately 3
endeavoring to communicate with me by means of speech, yet finding some 3
almost insuperable difficulty in so doing. A wall of curious spatial separation 3
seemed to stand between him and me - a mysterious, invisible wall which 3
completely baffled us both. 3
3
I had seen Robert as though at some distance, yet queerly enough he seemed at 3
the same time to be just beside me. He was both larger and smaller than in real 3
life, his apparent size varying directly, instead of inversely, with the distance as 3
he advanced and retreated in the course of conversation. That is, he grew larger 3
instead of smaller to my eye when he stepped away or backwards, and vice 3
versa; as if the laws of perspective in his case had been wholly reversed. His 3
aspect was misty and uncertain - as if he lacked sharp or permanent outlines; and 3
the anomalies of his coloring and clothing baffled me utterly at first. 3
3
At some point in my dream Robert's vocal efforts had finally crystallized into 3
audible speech - albeit speech of an abnormal thickness and dullness. I could not 3
for a time understand anything he said, and even in the dream racked my brain 3
for a clue to where he was, what he wanted to tell, and why his utterance was so 3
clumsy and unintelligible. Then little by little I began to distinguish words and 3
phrases, the very first of which sufficed to throw my dreaming self into the 3
wildest excitement and to establish a certain mental connection which had 3
3
3
3
1154 3
3
3
3
previously refused to take conscious form because of the utter incredibility of 3
what it implied. 3
3
I do not know how long I listened to those halting words amidst my deep 3
slumber, but hours must have passed while the strangely remote speaker 3
struggled on with his tale. There was revealed to me such a circumstance as I 3
cannot hope to make others believe without the strongest corroborative evidence, 3
yet which I was quite ready to accept as truth - both in the dream and after 3
waking - because of my former contacts with uncanny things. The boy was 3
obviously watching my face - mobile in receptive sleep - as he choked along; for 3
about the time I began to comprehend him, his own expression brightened and 3
gave signs of gratitude and hope. 3
3
Any attempt to hint at Robert's message, as it lingered in my ears after a sudden 3
awakening in the cold, brings this narrative to a point where I must choose my 3
words with the greatest care. Everything involved is so difficult to record that 3
one tends to flounder helplessly. I have said that the revelation established in my 3
mind a certain connection which reason had not allowed me to formulate 3
consciously before. This connection, I need no longer hesitate to hint, had to do 3
with the old Copenhagen mirror whose suggestions of motion had so impressed 3
me on the morning of the disappearance, and whose whorl-like contours and 3
apparent illusions of suction had later exerted such a disquieting fascination on 3
both Robert and me. 3
3
Resolutely, though my outer consciousness had previously rejected what my 3
intuition would have liked to imply, it could reject that stupendous conception 3
no longer. What was fantasy in the tale of "Alice" now came to me as a grave and 3
immediate reality. That looking-glass had indeed possessed a malign, abnormal 3
suction; and the struggling speaker in my dream made clear the extent to which 3
it violated all the known precedents of human experience and all the age-old 3
laws of our three sane dimensions. It was more than a mirror - it was a gate; a 3
trap; a link with spatial recesses not meant for the denizens of our visible 3
universe, and realizable only in terms of the most intricate non-Euclidean 3
mathematics. And in some outrageous fashion Robert Grandison had passed out 3
of our ken into the glass and was there immured, waiting for release. 3
3
It is significant that upon awakening I harbored no genuine doubt of the reality 3
of the revelation. That I had actually held conversation with a transdimensional 3
Robert, rather than evoked the whole episode from my broodings about his 3
disappearance and about the old illusions of the mirror, was as certain to my 3
utmost instincts as any of the instinctive certainties commonly recognized as 3
valid. 3
3
3
3
1155 3
3
3
3
The tale thus unfolded to me was of the most incredibly bizarre character. As 3
had been clear on the morning of his disappearance, Robert was intensely 3
fascinated by the ancient mirror. All through the hours of school, he had it in 3
mind to come back to my living-room and examine it further. When he did 3
arrive, after the close of the school day, it was somewhat later than two-twenty, 3
and I was absent in town. Finding me out and knowing that I would not mind, 3
he had come into my living-room and gone straight to the mirror; standing 3
before it and studying the place where, as we had noted, the whorls appeared to 3
converge. 3
3
Then, quite suddenly, there had come to him an overpowering urge to place his 3
hand upon this whorl- center. Almost reluctantly, against his better judgment, he 3
had done so; and upon making the contact had felt at once the strange, almost 3
painful suction which had perplexed him that morning. Immediately thereafter - 3
quite without warning, but with a wrench which seemed to twist and tear every 3
bone and muscle in his body and to bulge and press and cut at every nerve - he 3
had been abruptly drawn through and found himself inside. 3
3
Once through, the excruciatingly painful stress upon his entire system was 3
suddenly released. He felt, he said, as though he had just been born - a feeling 3
that made itself evident every time he tried to do anything; walk, stoop, turn his 3
head, or utter speech. Everything about his body seemed a misfit. 3
3
These sensations wore off after a long while, Robert's body becoming an 3
organized whole rather than a number of protesting parts. Of all the forms of 3
expression, speech remained the most difficult; doubtless because it is 3
complicated, bringing into play a number of different organs, muscles, and 3
tendons. Robert's feet, on the other hand, were the first members to adjust 3
themselves to the new conditions within the glass. 3
3
During the morning hours I rehearsed the whole reason-defying problem; 3
correlating everything I had seen and heard, dismissing the natural scepticism of 3
a man of sense, and scheming to devise possible plans for Robert's release from 3
his incredible prison. As I did so a number of originally perplexing points 3
became clear - or at least, clearer - to me. 3
3
There was, for example, the matter of Robert's coloring. His face and hands, as I 3
have indicated, were a kind of dull greenish dark-blue; and I may add that his 3
familiar blue Norfolk jacket had turned to a pale lemon-yellow while his trousers 3
remained a neutral gray as before. Reflecting on this after waking, I found the 3
circumstance closely allied to the reversal of perspective which made Robert 3
seem to grow larger when receding and smaller when approaching. Here, too, 3
was a physical reversal - for every detail of his coloring in the unknown 3
3
3
3
1156 3
3
3
3
dimension was the exact reverse or complement of the corresponding color detail 3
in normal life. In physics the typical complementary colors are blue and yellow, 3
and red and green. These pairs are opposites, and when mixed yield gray. 3
Robert's natural color was a pinkish-buff, the opposite of which is the greenish- 3
blue I saw. His blue coat had become yellow, while the gray trousers remained 3
gray. This latter point baffled me until I remembered that gray is itself a mixture 3
of opposites. There is no opposite for gray - or rather, it is its own opposite. 3
3
Another clarified point was that pertaining to Robert's curiously dulled and 3
thickened speech - as well as to the general awkwardness and sense of misfit 3
bodily parts of which he complained. This, at the outset, was a puzzle indeed; 3
though after long thought the clue occurred to me. Here again was the same 3
reversal which affected perspective and coloration. Anyone in the fourth 3
dimension must necessarily be reversed in just this way - hands and feet, as well 3
as colors and perspectives, being changed about. It would be the same with all 3
the other dual organs, such as nostrils, ears, and eyes. Thus Robert had been 3
talking with a reversed tongue, teeth, vocal cords, and kindred speech- 3
apparatus; so that his difficulties in utterance were little to be wondered at. 3
3
As the morning wore on, my sense of the stark reality and maddening urgency of 3
the dream-disclosed situation increased rather than decreased. More and more I 3
felt that something must be done, yet realized that I could not seek advice or aid. 3
Such a story as mine - a conviction based upon mere dreaming - could not 3
conceivably bring me anything but ridicule or suspicions as to my mental state. 3
And what, indeed, could I do, aided or unaided, with as little working data as 3
my nocturnal impressions had provided? I must, I finally recognized, have more 3
information before I could even think of a possible plan for releasing Robert. This 3
could come only through the receptive conditions of sleep, and it heartened me 3
to reflect that according to every probability my telepathic contact would be 3
resumed the moment I fell into deep slumber again. 3
3
I accomplished sleeping that afternoon, after a midday dinner at which, through 3
rigid self-control, I succeeded in concealing from Browne and his wife the 3
tumultuous thoughts that crashed through my mind. Hardly had my eyes closed 3
when a dim telepathic image began to appear; and I soon realized to my infinite 3
excitement that it was identical with what I had seen before. If anything, it was 3
more distinct; and when it began to speak I seemed able to grasp a greater 3
proportion of the words. 3
3
During this sleep I found most of the morning's deductions confirmed, though 3
the interview was mysteriously cut off long prior to my awakening. Robert had 3
seemed apprehensive just before communication ceased, but had already told me 3
that in his strange fourth-dimensional prison colors and spatial relationships 3
3
3
3
1157 3
3
3
3
were indeed reversed - black being white, distance increasing apparent size, and 3
so on. 3
3
He had also intimated that, notwithstanding his possession of full physical form 3
and sensations, most human vital properties seemed curiously suspended. 3
Nutriment, for example, was quite unnecessary - a phenomenon really more 3
singular than the omnipresent reversal of objects and attributes, since the latter 3
was a reasonable and mathematically indicated state of things. Another 3
significant piece of information was that the only exit from the glass to the world 3
was the entrance-way, and that this was permanently barred and impenetrably 3
sealed, so far as egress was concerned. 3
3
That night I had another visitation from Robert; nor did such impressions, 3
received at odd intervals while I slept receptively minded, cease during the 3
entire period of his incarceration. His efforts to communicate were desperate and 3
often pitiful; for at times the telepathic bond would weaken, while at other times 3
fatigue, excitement, or fear of interruption would hamper and thicken his speech. 3
I may as well narrate as a continuous whole all that Robert told me throughout 3
the whole series of transient mental contacts - perhaps supplementing it at 3
certain points with facts directly related after his release. The telepathic 3
information was fragmentary and often nearly inarticulate, but I studied it over 3
and over during the waking intervals of three intense days; classifying and 3
cogitating with feverish diligence, since it was all that I had to go upon if the boy 3
were to be brought back into our world. 3
3
The fourth-dimensional region in which Robert found himself was not, as in 3
scientific romance, an unknown and infinite realm of strange sights and fantastic 3
denizens; but was rather a projection of certain limited parts of our own 3
terrestrial sphere within an alien and normally inaccessible aspect or direction of 3
space. It was a curiously fragmentary, intangible, and heterogeneous world - a 3
series of apparently dissociated scenes merging indistinctly one into the other; 3
their constituent details having an obviously different status from that of an 3
object drawn into the ancient mirror as Robert had been drawn. These scenes 3
were like dream-vistas or magic -lantern images - elusive visual impressions of 3
which the boy was not really a part, but which formed a sort of panoramic 3
background or ethereal environment against which or amidst which he moved. 3
3
He could not touch any of the parts of these scenes - walls, trees, furniture, and 3
the like - but whether this was because they were truly non-material, or because 3
they always receded at his approach, he was singularly unable to determine. 3
Everything seemed fluid, mutable, and unreal. When he walked, it appeared to 3
be on whatever lower surface the visible scene might have - floor, path, 3
greensward, or such; but upon analysis he always found that the contact was an 3
3
3
3
1158 3
3
3
3
illusion. There was never any difference in the resisting force met by his feet - 3
and by his hands when he would stoop experimentally - no matter what changes 3
of apparent surface might be involved. He could not describe this foundation or 3
limiting plane on which he walked as anything more definite than a virtually 3
abstract pressure balancing his gravity. Of definite tactile distinctiveness it had 3
none, and supplementing it there seemed to be a kind of restricted levitational 3
force which accomplished transfers of altitude. He could never actually climb 3
stairs, yet would gradually walk up from a lower level to a higher. 3
3
Passage from one definite scene to another involved a sort of gliding through a 3
region of shadow or blurred focus where the details of each scene mingled 3
curiously. All the vistas were distinguished by the absence of transient objects, 3
and the indefinite or ambiguous appearance of such semi-transient objects as 3
furniture or details of vegetation. The lighting of every scene was diffuse and 3
perplexing, and of course the scheme of reversed colors - bright red grass, yellow 3
sky with confused black and gray cloud-forms, white tree-trunks, and green 3
brick walls - gave to everything an air of unbelievable grotesquerie. There was an 3
alteration of day and night, which turned out to be a reversal of the normal hours 3
of light and darkness at whatever point on the earth the mirror might be 3
hanging. 3
3
This seemingly irrelevant diversity of the scenes puzzled Robert until he realized 3
that they comprised merely such places as had been reflected for long continuous 3
periods in the ancient glass. This also explained the odd absence of transient 3
objects, the generally arbitrary boundaries of vision, and the fact that all exteriors 3
were framed by the outlines of doorways or windows. The glass, it appeared, 3
had power to store up these intangible scenes through long exposure; though it 3
could never absorb anything corporeally, as Robert had been absorbed, except by 3
a very different and particular process. 3
3
But - to me at least - the most incredible aspect of the mad phenomenon was the 3
monstrous subversion of our known laws of space involved in the relation of 3
various illusory scenes to the actual terrestrial regions represented. I have spoken 3
of the glass as storing up the images of these regions, but this is really an inexact 3
definition. In truth, each of the mirror scenes formed a true and quasi-permanent 3
fourth- dimensional projection of the corresponding mundane region; so that 3
whenever Robert moved to a certain part of a certain scene, as he moved into the 3
image of my room when sending his telepathic messages, he was actually in that 3
place itself, on earth - though under spatial conditions which cut off all sensory 3
communication, in either direction, between him and the present tri-dimensional 3
aspect of the place. 3
3
3
3
1159 3
3
3
3
Theoretically speaking, a prisoner in the glass could in a few moments go 3
anywhere on our planet - into any place, that is, which had ever been reflected in 3
the mirror's surface. This probably applied even to places where the mirror had 3
not hung long enough to produce a clear illusory scene; the terrestrial region 3
being then represented by a zone of more or less formless shadow. Outside the 3
definite scenes was a seemingly limitless waste of neutral gray shadow about 3
which Robert could never be certain, and into which he never dared stray far lest 3
he become hopelessly lost to the real and mirror worlds alike. 3
3
Among the earliest particulars which Robert gave, was the fact that he was not 3
alone in his confinement. Various others, all in antique garb, were in there with 3
him - a corpulent middle-aged gentleman with tied queue and velvet knee- 3
breeches who spoke English fluently though with a marked Scandinavian accent; 3
a rather beautiful small girl with very blonde hair which appeared a glossy dark 3
blue; two apparently mute Negroes whose features contrasted grotesquely with 3
the pallor of their reversed-colored skins; three young men; one young woman; a 3
very small child, almost an infant; and a lean, elderly Dane of extremely 3
distinctive aspect and a kind of half-malign intellectuality of countenance. 3
3
This last-named individual - Axel Holm, who wore the satin small-clothes, 3
flared-skirted coat, and voluminous full-bottomed periwig of an age more than 3
two centuries in the past - was notable among the little band as being the one 3
responsible for the presence of them all. He it was who, skilled equally in the arts 3
of magic and glass working, had long ago fashioned this strange dimensional 3
prison in which himself, his slaves, and those whom he chose to invite or allure 3
thither were immured unchangingly for as long as the mirror might endure. 3
3
Holm was born early in the seventeenth century, and had followed with 3
tremendous competence and success the trade of a glass-blower and molder in 3
Copenhagen. His glass, especially in the form of large drawing-room mirrors, 3
was always at a premium. But the same bold mind which had made him the first 3
glazier of Europe also served to carry his interests and ambitions far beyond the 3
sphere of mere material craftsmanship. He had studied the world around him, 3
and chafed at the limitations of human knowledge and capability. Eventually he 3
sought for dark ways to overcome those limitations, and gained more success 3
than is good for any mortal. He had aspired to enjoy something like eternity, the 3
mirror being his provision to secure this end. Serious study of the fourth 3
dimension was far from beginning with Einstein in our own era; and Holm, more 3
than erudite in all the methods of his day, knew that a bodily entrance into that 3
hidden phase of space would prevent him from dying in the ordinary physical 3
sense. Research showed him that the principle of reflection undoubtedly forms 3
the chief gate to all dimensions beyond our familiar three; and chance placed in 3
his hands a small and very ancient glass whose cryptic properties he believed he 3
3
3
3
1160 3
3
3
3
could turn to advantage. Once "inside" this mirror according to the method he 3
had envisaged, he felt that "life" in the sense of form and consciousness would 3
go on virtually forever, provided the mirror could be preserved indefinitely from 3
breakage or deterioration. 3
3
Holm made a magnificent mirror, such as would be prized and carefully 3
preserved; and in it deftly fused the strange whorl-configured relic he had 3
acquired. Having thus prepared his refuge and his trap, he began to plan his 3
mode of entrance and conditions of tenancy. He would have with him both 3
servitors and companions; and as an experimental beginning he sent before him 3
into the glass two dependable Negro slaves brought from the West Indies. What 3
his sensations must have been upon beholding this first concrete demonstration 3
of his theories, only imagination can conceive. 3
3
Undoubtedly a man of his knowledge realized that absence from the outside 3
world, if deferred beyond the natural span of life of those within, must mean 3
instant dissolution at the first attempt to return to that world. But, barring that 3
misfortune or accidental breakage, those within would remain forever as they 3
were at the time of entrance. They would never grow old, and would need 3
neither food nor drink. 3
3
To make his prison tolerable he sent ahead of him certain books and writing 3
materials, a chair and table of stoutest workmanship, and a few other accessories. 3
He knew that the images which the glass would reflect or absorb would not be 3
tangible, but would merely extend around him like a background of dream. His 3
own transition in 1687 was a momentous experience; and must have been 3
attended by mixed sensations of triumph and terror. Had anything gone wrong, 3
there were frightful possibilities of being lost in dark and inconceivable multiple 3
dimensions. 3
3
For over fifty years he had been unable to secure any additions to the little 3
company of himself and slaves, but later on he had perfected his telepathic 3
method of visualizing small sections of the outside world close to the glass, and 3
attracting certain individuals in those areas through the mirror's strange 3
entrance. Thus Robert, influenced into a desire to press upon the "door," had 3
been lured within. Such visualizations depended wholly on telepathy, since no 3
one inside the mirror could see out into the world of men. 3
3
It was, in truth, a strange life that Holm and his company had lived inside the 3
glass. Since the mirror had stood for fully a century with its face to the dusty 3
stone wall of the shed where I found it, Robert was the first being to enter this 3
limbo after all that interval. His arrival was a gala event, for he brought news of 3
the outside world which must have been of the most startling impressiveness to 3
3
3
3
1161 3
3
3
3
the more thoughtful of those within. He, in his turn - young though he was - felt 3
overwhelmingly the weirdness of meeting and talking with persons who had 3
been alive in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. 3
3
The deadly monotony of life for the prisoners can only be vaguely conjectured. 3
As mentioned, its extensive spatial variety was limited to localities which had 3
been reflected in the mirror for long periods; and many of these had become dim 3
and strange as tropical climates had made inroads on the surface. Certain 3
localities were bright and beautiful, and in these the company usually gathered. 3
But no scene could be fully satisfying; since the visible objects were all unreal 3
and intangible, and often of perplexingly indefinite outline. When the tedious 3
periods of darkness came, the general custom was to indulge in memories, 3
reflections, or conversations. Each one of that strange, pathetic group had 3
retained his or her personality unchanged and unchangeable, since becoming 3
immune to the time effects of outside space. 3
3
The number of inanimate objects within the glass, aside from the clothing of the 3
prisoners, was very small; being largely limited to the accessories Holm had 3
provided for himself. The rest did without even furniture, since sleep and fatigue 3
had vanished along with most other vital attributes. Such inorganic things as 3
were present, seemed as exempt from decay as the living beings. The lower 3
forms of animal life were wholly absent. 3
3
Robert derived most of his information from Herr Thiele, the gentleman who 3
spoke English with a Scandinavian accent. This portly Dane had taken a fancy to 3
him, and talked at considerable length. The others, too, had received him with 3
courtesy and goodwill; Holm himself, seeming well-disposed, had told him 3
about various matters including the door of the trap. 3
3
The boy, as he told me later, was sensible enough never to attempt 3
communication with me when Holm was nearby. Twice, while thus engaged, he 3
had seen Holm appear; and had accordingly ceased at once. At no time could I 3
see the world behind the mirror's surface. Robert's visual image, which included 3
his bodily form and the clothing connected with it, was - like the aural image of 3
his halting voice and like his own visualization of myself - a case of purely 3
telepathic transmission; and did not involve true interdimensional sight. 3
However, had Robert been as trained a telepathist as Holm, he might have 3
transmitted a few strong images apart from his immediate person. 3
3
Throughout this period of revelation I had, of course, been desperately trying to 3
devise a method for Robert's release. On the fourth day - the ninth after the 3
disappearance - I hit on a solution. Everything considered, my laboriously 3
formulated process was not a very complicated one; though I could not tell 3
3
3
3
1162 3
3
3
3
beforehand how it would work, while the possibility of ruinous consequences in 3
case of a slip was appalling. This process depended, basically, on the fact that 3
there was no possible exit from inside the glass. If Holm and his prisoners were 3
permanently sealed in, then release must come wholly from outside. Other 3
considerations included the disposal of the other prisoners, if any survived, and 3
especially of Axel Holm. What Robert had told me of him was anything but 3
reassuring; and I certainly did not wish him loose in my apartment, free once 3
more to work his evil will upon the world. The telepathic messages had not 3
made fully clear the effect of liberation on those who had entered the glass so 3
long ago. 3
3
There was, too, a final though minor problem in case of success - that of getting 3
Robert back into the routine of school life without having to explain the 3
incredible. In case of failure, it was highly inadvisable to have witnesses present 3
at the release operations - and lacking these, I simply could not attempt to relate 3
the actual facts if I should succeed. Even to me the reality seemed a mad one 3
whenever I let my mind turn from the data so compellingly presented in that 3
tense series of dreams. 3
3
When I had thought these problems through as far as possible, I procured a large 3
magnifying-glass from the school laboratory and studied minutely every square 3
millimeter of that whorl-center which presumably marked the extent of the 3
original ancient mirror used by Holm. Even with this aid I could not quite trace 3
the exact boundary between the old area and the surface added by the Danish 3
wizard; but after a long study decided on a conjectural oval boundary which I 3
outlined very precisely with a soft blue pencil. I then made a trip to Stamford, 3
where I procured a heavy glass-cutting tool; for my primary idea was to remove 3
the ancient and magically potent mirror from its later setting. 3
3
My next step was to figure out the best time of day to make the crucial 3
experiment. I finally settled on two-thirty a.m. - both because it was a good 3
season for uninterrupted work, and because it was the "opposite" of two-thirty 3
p.m., the probable moment at which Robert had entered the mirror. This form of 3
"oppositeness" may or may not have been relevant, but I knew at least that the 3
chosen hour was as good as any - and perhaps better than most. 3
3
I finally set to work in the early morning of the eleventh day after the 3
disappearance, having drawn all the shades of my living-room and closed and 3
locked the door into the hallway. Following with breathless care the elliptical line 3
I had traced, I worked around the whorl-section with my steel-wheeled cutting 3
tool. The ancient glass, half an inch thick, crackled crisply under the firm, 3
uniform pressure; and upon completing the circuit I cut around it a second time, 3
crunching the roller more deeply into the glass. 3
3
3
3
1163 3
3
3
3
Then, very carefully indeed, I lifted the heavy mirror down from its console and 3
leaned it face-inward against the wall; prying off two of the thin, narrow boards 3
nailed to the back. With equal caution I smartly tapped the cut-around space 3
with the heavy wooden handle of the glass-cutter. 3
3
At the very first tap the whorl-containing section of glass dropped out on the 3
Bokhara rug beneath. I did not know what might happen, but was keyed up for 3
anything, and took a deep involuntary breath. I was on my knees for 3
convenience at the moment, with my face quite near the newly made aperture; 3
and as I breathed there poured into my nostrils a powerful dusty odor - a smell 3
not comparable to any other I have ever encountered. Then everything within 3
my range of vision suddenly turned to a dull gray before my failing eyesight as I 3
felt myself overpowered by an invisible force which robbed my muscles of their 3
power to function. 3
3
I remember grasping weakly and futilely at the edge of the nearest window 3
drapery and feeling it rip loose from its fastening. Then I sank slowly to the floor 3
as the darkness of oblivion passed over me. 3
3
When I regained consciousness I was lying on the Bokhara rug with my legs held 3
unaccountably up in the air. The room was full of that hideous and inexplicable 3
dusty smell - and as my eyes began to take in definite images I saw that Robert 3
Grandison stood in front of me. It was he - fully in the flesh and with his coloring 3
normal - who was holding my legs aloft to bring the blood back to my head as 3
the school's first-aid course had taught him to do with persons who had fainted. 3
For a moment I was struck mute by the stifling odor and by a bewilderment 3
which quickly merged into a sense of triumph. Then I found myself able to move 3
and speak collectedly. 3
3
I raised a tentative hand and waved feebly at Robert. 3
3
"All right, old man," I murmured, "you can let my legs down now. Many thanks. 3
I'm all right again, I think. It was the smell - I imagine - that got me. Open that 3
farthest window, please - wide - from the bottom. That's it - thanks. No - leave 3
the shade down the way it was." 3
3
I struggled to my feet, my disturbed circulation adjusting itself in waves, and 3
stood upright hanging to the back of a big chair. I was still "groggy," but a blast 3
of fresh, bitterly cold air from the window revived me rapidly. I sat down in the 3
big chair and looked at Robert, now walking toward me. 3
3
"First," I said hurriedly, "tell me, Robert - those others - Holm? What happened 3
to them, when I - opened the exit?" 3
3
3
3
1164 3
3
3
3
Robert paused half-way across the room and looked at me very gravely. 3
3
"I saw them fade away - into nothingness - Mr. Canevin/' he said with 3
solemnity; "and with them - everything. There isn't any more 'inside/ sir - thank 3
God, and you, sir!" 3
3
And young Robert, at last yielding to the sustained strain which he had borne 3
through all those terrible eleven days, suddenly broke down like a little child and 3
began to weep hysterically in great, stifling, dry sobs. 3
3
I picked him up and placed him gently on my davenport, threw a rug over him, 3
sat down by his side, and put a calming hand on his forehead. 3
3
"Take it easy, old fellow," I said soothingly. 3
3
The boy's sudden and very natural hysteria passed as quickly as it had come on 3
as I talked to him reassuringly about my plans for his quiet restoration to the 3
school. The interest of the situation and the need of concealing the incredible 3
truth beneath a rational explanation took hold of his imagination as I had 3
expected; and at last he sat up eagerly, telling the details of his release and 3
listening to the instructions I had thought out. He had, it seems, been in the 3
"projected area" of my bedroom when I opened the way back, and had emerged 3
in that actual room - hardly realizing that he was "out." Upon hearing a fall in 3
the living-room he had hastened thither, finding me on the rug in my fainting 3
spell. 3
3
I need mention only briefly my method of restoring Robert in a seemingly 3
normal way - how I smuggled him out of the window in an old hat and sweater 3
of mine, took him down the road in my quietly started car, coached him carefully 3
in a tale I had devised, and returned to arouse Browne with the news of his 3
discovery. He had, I explained, been walking alone on the afternoon of his 3
disappearance; and had been offered a motor ride by two young men who, as a 3
joke and over his protests that he could go no farther than Stamford and back, 3
had begun to carry him past that town. Jumping from the car during a traffic 3
stop with the intention of hitch-hiking back before Call-Over, he had been hit by 3
another car just as the traffic was released - awakening ten days later in the 3
Greenwich home of the people who had hit him. On learning the date, I added, 3
he had immediately telephoned the school; and I, being the only one awake, had 3
answered the call and hurried after him in my car without stopping to notify 3
anyone. 3
3
Browne, who at once telephoned to Robert's parents, accepted my story without 3
question; and forbore to interrogate the boy because of the latter's manifest 3
3
3
3
1165 3

exhaustion. It was arranged that he should remain at the school for a rest, under 3
the expert care of Mrs. Browne, a former trained nurse. I naturally saw a good 3
deal of him during the remainder of the Christmas vacation, and was thus 3
enabled to fill in certain gaps in his fragmentary dream-story. 3
3
Now and then we would almost doubt the actuality of what had occurred; 3
wondering whether we had not both shared some monstrous delusion born of 3
the mirror's glittering hypnotism, and whether the tale of the ride and accident 3
were not after all the real truth. But whenever we did so we would be brought 3
back to belief by some monstrous and haunting memory; with me, of Robert's 3
dream-figure and its thick voice and inverted colors; with him, of the whole 3
fantastic pageantry of ancient people and dead scenes that he had witnessed. 3
And then there was that joint recollection of that damnable dusty odor. . . . We 3
knew what it meant: the instant dissolution of those who had entered an alien 3
dimension a century and more ago. 3
3
There are, in addition, at least two lines of rather more positive evidence; one of 3
which comes through my researches in Danish annals concerning the sorcerer. 3
Axel Holm. Such a person, indeed, left many traces in folklore and written 3
records; and diligent library sessions, plus conferences with various learned 3
Danes, have shed much more light on his evil fame. At present I need say only 3
that the Copenhagen glass-blower - born in 1612 - was a notorious Luciferian 3
whose pursuits and final vanishing formed a matter of awed debate over two 3
centuries ago. He had burned with a desire to know all things and to conquer 3
every limitation of mankind - to which end he had delved deeply into occult and 3
forbidden fields ever since he was a child. 3
3
He was commonly held to have joined a coven of the dreaded witch-cult, and the 3
vast lore of ancient Scandinavian myth - with its Loki the Sly One and the 3
accursed Fenris-Wolf - was soon an open book to him. He had strange interests 3
and objectives, few of which were definitely known, but some of which were 3
recognized as intolerably evil. It is recorded that his two Negro helpers, 3
originally slaves from the Danish West Indies, had become mute soon after their 3
acquisition by him; and that they had disappeared not long before his own 3
disappearance from the ken of mankind. 3
3
Near the close of an already long life the idea of a glass of immortality appears to 3
have entered his mind. That he had acquired an enchanted mirror of 3
inconceivable antiquity was a matter of common whispering; it being alleged 3
that he had purloined it from a fellow-sorcerer who had entrusted it to him for 3
polishing. 3
3
3
3
1166 3
3
3
3
This mirror - according to popular tales a trophy as potent in its way as the 3
better-known Aegis of Minerva or Hammer of Thor - was a small oval object 3
called "Loki's Glass/' made of some polished fusible mineral and having magical 3
properties which included the divination of the immediate future and the power 3
to show the possessor his enemies. That it had deeper potential properties, 3
realizable in the hands of an erudite magician, none of the common people 3
doubted; and even educated persons attached much fearful importance to 3
Holm's rumored attempts to incorporate it in a larger glass of immortality. Then 3
had come the wizard's disappearance in 1687, and the final sale and dispersal of 3
his goods amidst a growing cloud of fantastic legendry. It was, altogether, just 3
such a story as one would laugh at if possessed of no particular key; yet to me, 3
remembering those dream messages and having Robert Grandison's 3
corroboration before me, it formed a positive confirmation of all the bewildering 3
marvels that had been unfolded. 3
3
But as I have said, there is still another line of rather positive evidence - of a very 3
different character - at my disposal. Two days after his release, as Robert, greatly 3
improved in strength and appearance, was placing a log on my living-room fire, 3
I noticed a certain awkwardness in his motions and was struck by a persistent 3
idea. Summoning him to my desk I suddenly asked him to pick up an ink-stand - 3
and was scarcely surprised to note that, despite lifelong right-handedness, he 3
obeyed unconsciously with his left hand. Without alarming him, I then asked 3
that he unbutton his coat and let me listen to his cardiac action. What I found 3
upon placing my ear to his chest - and what I did not tell him for some time 3
afterward - was that his heart was beating on his right side. 3
3
He had gone into the glass right-handed and with all organs in their normal 3
positions. Now he was left- handed and with organs reversed, and would 3
doubtless continue so for the rest of his life. Clearly, the dimensional transition 3
had been no illusion - for this physical change was tangible and unmistakable. 3
Had there been a natural exit from the glass, Robert would probably have 3
undergone a thorough re-reversal and emerged in perfect normality - as indeed 3
the color-scheme of his body and clothing did emerge. The forcible nature of his 3
release, however, undoubtedly set something awry; so that dimensions no longer 3
had a chance to right themselves as chromatic wave-frequencies still did. 3
3
I had not merely opened Holm's trap; I had destroyed it; and at the particular 3
stage of destruction marked by Robert's escape some of the reversing properties 3
had perished. It is significant that in escaping Robert had felt no pain comparable 3
to that experienced in entering. Had the destruction been still more sudden, I 3
shiver to think of the monstrosities of color the boy would always have been 3
forced to bear. I may add that after discovering Robert's reversal I examined the 3
rumpled and discarded clothing he had worn in the glass, and found, as I had 3
3
3
3
1167 3
3
3
3
expected, a complete reversal of pockets, buttons, and all other corresponding 3
details. 3
3
At this moment Loki's Glass, just as it fell on my Bokhara rug from the now 3
patched and harmless mirror, weighs down a sheaf of papers on my writing- 3
table here in St. Thomas, venerable capital of the Danish West Indies - now the 3
American Virgin Islands. Various collectors of old Sandwich glass have mistaken 3
it for an odd bit of that early American product - but I privately realize that my 3
paper-weight is an antique of far subtler and more paleogean craftsmanship. 3
Still, I do not disillusion such enthusiasts. 3

The Tree On The Hill - with Duane W. 3
Ritnel 3
3
Written 1934 3
3
Southeast of Hampden, near the tortuous Salmon River gorge, is a range of steep, 3
rocky hills which have defied all efforts of sturdy homesteaders. The canyons are 3
too deep and the slopes too precipitous to encourage anything save seasonal 3
livestock grazing. The last time I visited Hampden the region - known as Hell's 3
Acres - was part of the Blue Mountain Forest Reserve. There are no roads linking 3
this inaccessible locality with the outside world, and the hillfolk will tell you that 3
it is indeed a spot transplanted from his Satanic Majesty's front yard. There is a 3
local superstition that the area is haunted - but by what or by whom no one 3
seems to know. Natives will not venture within its mysterious depths, for they 3
believe the stories handed down to them by the Nez Perce Indians, who have 3
shunned the region for untold generations, because, according to them, it is a 3
playground of certain giant devils from the Outside. These suggestive tales made 3
me very curious. 3
3
My first excursion - and my last, thank God! - into those hills occurred while 3
Constantine Theunis and I were living in Hampden the summer of 1938. He was 3
writing a treatise on Egyptian mythology, and I found myself alone much of the 3
time, despite the fact that we shared a modest cabin on Beacon Street, within 3
sight of the infamous Pirate House, built by Exer Jones over sixty years ago. 3
3
The morning of June 23rd found me walking in those oddly shaped hills, which 3
had, since seven o'clock, seemed very ordinary indeed. I must have been about 3
seven miles south of Hampden before I noticed anything unusual. I was climbing 3
a grassy ridge overlooking a particularly deep canyon, when I came upon an 3
area totally devoid of the usual bunch-grass and greaseweed. It extended 3
southward, over numerous hills and valleys. At first I thought the spot had been 3
burned over the previous fall, but upon examining the turf, I found no signs of a 3
blaze. The nearby slopes and ravines looked terribly scarred and seared, as if 3
some gigantic torch had blasted them, wiping away all vegetation. And yet there 3
was no evidence of fire. . . 3
3
I moved on over rich, black soil in which no grass flourished. As I headed for the 3
approximate center of this desolate area, I began to notice a strange silence. There 3
were no larks, no rabbits, and even the insects seemed to have deserted the place. 3
I gained the summit of a lofty knoll and tried to guess at the size of that bleak, 3
inexplicable region. Then I saw the lone tree. 3
3
3
3
1169 3
3
3
3
It stood on a hill somewhat higher than its companions, and attracted the eye 3
because it was so utterly unexpected. I had seen no trees for miles: thorn and 3
hackberry bushes clustered the shallower ravines, but there had been no mature 3
trees. Strange to find one standing on the crest of the hill. 3
3
I crossed two steep canyons before I came to it; and a surprise awaited me. It was 3
not a pine tree, nor a fir tree, nor a hackberry tree. I had never, in all my life, seen 3
one to compare with it - and I never have to this day, for which I am eternally 3
thankful! 3
3
More than anything it resembled an oak. It had a huge, twisted trunk, fully a 3
yard in diameter, and the large limbs began spreading outward scarcely seven 3
feet from the ground. The leaves were round, and curiously alike in size and 3
design. It might have been a tree painted on a canvas, but I will swear that it was 3
real. I shall always know that it was real, despite what Theunis said later. 3
3
I recall that I glanced at the sun and judged the time to be about ten o'clock a.m., 3
although I did not look at my watch. The day was becoming warm, and I sat for 3
a while in the welcome shade of the huge tree. Then I regarded the rank grass 3
that flourished beneath it - another singular phenomenon when I remembered 3
the bleak terrain through which I had passed. A wild maze of hills, ravines, and 3
bluffs hemmed me in on all sides, although the rise on which I sat was rather 3
higher than any other within miles. I looked far to the east - and I jumped to my 3
feet, startled and amazed. Shimmering through a blue haze of distance were the 3
Bitterroot Mountains! There is no other range of snow-capped peaks within three 3
hundred miles of Hampden; and I knew - at this altitude - that I shouldn't be 3
seeing them at all. For several minutes I gazed at the marvel; then I became 3
drowsy. I lay in the rank grass, beneath the tree. I unstrapped my camera, took 3
off my hat, and relaxed, staring skyward through the green leaves. I closed my 3
eyes. 3
3
Then a curious phenomenon began to assail me - a vague, cloudy sort of vision - 3
glimpsing or day- dreaming seemingly without relevance to anything familiar. I 3
thought I saw a great temple by a sea of ooze, where three suns gleamed in a pale 3
red sky. The vast tomb, or temple, was an anomalous color - a nameless blue- 3
violet shade. Large beasts flew in the cloudy sky, and I seemed to hear the 3
pounding of their scaly wings. I went nearer the stone temple, and a huge 3
doorway loomed in front of me. Within that portal were swirling shadows that 3
seemed to dart and leer and try to snatch me inside that awful darkness. I 3
thought I saw three flaming eyes in the shifting void of a doorway, and I 3
screamed with mortal fear. In that noisome depth, I knew, lurked utter 3
destruction - a living hell even worse than death. I screamed again. The vision 3
faded. 3
3
3
3
1170 3
3
3
3
I saw the round leaves and the sane earthly sky. I struggled to rise. I was 3
trembling; cold perspiration beaded my brow. I had a mad impulse to flee; run 3
insanely from that sinister tree on the hill - but I checked the absurd intuition and 3
sat down, trying to collect my senses. Never had I dreamed anything so realistic; 3
so horrifying. What had caused the vision? I had been reading several of 3
Theunis' tomes on ancient Egypt. ... I mopped my forehead, and decided that it 3
was time for lunch. But I did not feel like eating. 3
3
Then I had an inspiration. I would take a few snapshots of the tree, for Theunis. 3
They might shock him out of his habitual air of unconcern. Perhaps I would tell 3
him about the dream. . . . Opening my camera, I took half a dozen shots of the 3
tree, and every aspect of the landscape as seen from the tree. Also, I included one 3
of the gleaming, snow-crested peaks. I might want to return, and these photos 3
would help. . . . 3
3
Folding the camera, I returned to my cushion of soft grass. Had that spot beneath 3
the tree a certain alien enchantment? I know that I was reluctant to leave it. ... 3
3
I gazed upward at the curious round leaves. I closed my eyes. A breeze stirred 3
the branches, and their whispered music lulled me into tranquil oblivion. And 3
suddenly I saw again the pale red sky and the three suns. The land of three 3
shadows! Again the great temple came into view. I seemed to be floating on the 3
air - a disembodied spirit exploring the wonders of a mad, multi-dimensional 3
world! The temple's oddly angled cornices frightened me, and I knew that this 3
place was one that no man on earth had ever seen in his wildest dreams. 3
3
Again the vast doorway yawned before me; and I was sucked within that black, 3
writhing cloud. I seemed to be staring at space unlimited. I saw a void beyond 3
my vocabulary to describe; a dark, bottomless gulf teeming with nameless 3
shapes and entities - things of madness and delirium, as tenuous as a mist from 3
Shamballah. 3
3
My soul shrank. I was terribly afraid. I screamed and screamed, and felt that I 3
would soon go mad. Then in my dream I ran and ran in a fever of utter terror, 3
but I did not know what I was running from. ... I left that hideous temple and 3
that hellish void, yet I knew I must, barring some miracle, return. . . . 3
3
At last my eyes flew open. I was not beneath the tree. I was sprawled on a rocky 3
slope, my clothing torn and disordered. My hands were bleeding. I stood up, 3
pain stabbing through me. I recognized the spot - the ridge where I had first seen 3
the blasted area! I must have walked miles - unconscious! The tree was not in 3
sight, and I was glad. . . . Even the knees of my trousers were torn, as if I had 3
crawled part of the way. . . . 3
3
3
3
1171 3
3
3
3
I glanced at the sun. Late afternoon! Where had I been? I snatched out my watch. 3
It had stopped at 10:34. 3
3
II. 3
3
"So you have the snapshots?" Theunis drawled. I met his gray eyes across the 3
breakfast table. Three days had slipped by since my return from Hell's Acres. I 3
had told him about the dream beneath the tree, and he had laughed. 3
3
"Yes," I replied. "They came last night. Haven't had a chance to open them yet. 3
Give 'em a good, careful study - if they aren't all failures. Perhaps you'll change 3
your mind." 3
3
Theunis smiled; sipped his coffee. I gave him the unopened envelope and he 3
quickly broke the seal and withdrew the pictures. He glanced at the first one, and 3
the smile faded from his leonine face. He crushed out his cigarette. 3
3
"My God, man! Look at this!" 3
3
I seized the glossy rectangle. It was the first picture of the tree, taken at a distance 3
of fifty feet or so. The cause of Theunis' excitement escaped me. There it was, 3
standing boldly on the hill, while below it grew the jungle of grass where I had 3
lain. In the distance were my snow-capped mountains! 3
3
"There you are," I cried. "The proof of my story. . . " 3
3
"Look at it!" Theunis snapped. "The shadows... there are three for every rock, 3
bush, and tree!" 3
3
He was right... Below the tree, spread in fanlike incongruity, lay three 3
overlapping shadows. Suddenly I realized that the picture held an abnormal and 3
inconsistent element. The leaves on the thing were too lush for the work of sane 3
nature, while the trunk was bulged and knotted in the most abhorrent shapes. 3
Theunis dropped the picture on the table. 3
3
"There is something wrong," I muttered. "The tree I saw didn't look as repulsive 3
as that... " 3
3
"Are you sure?" Theunis grated. "The fact is, you may have seen many things 3
not recorded on this film." 3
3
"It shows more than I saw!" 3
3
3
3
1172 3
3
3
3
"That's the point. There is something damnably out of place in this landscape; 3
something I can't understand. The tree seems to suggest a thought - beyond my 3
grasp. ... It is too misty; too uncertain; too unreal to be natural!" He rapped 3
nervous fingers on the table. He snatched the remaining films and shuffled 3
through them, rapidly. 3
3
I reached for the snapshot he had dropped, and sensed a touch of bizarre 3
uncertainty and strangeness as my eyes absorbed its every detail. The flowers 3
and weeds pointed at varying angles, while some of the grass grew in the most 3
bewildering fashion. The tree seemed too veiled and clouded to be readily 3
distinguished, but I noted the huge limbs and the half-bent flower stems that 3
were ready to fall over, yet did not fall. And the many, overlapping shadows. . . . 3
They were, altogether, very disquieting shadows - too long or short when 3
compared to the stems they fell below to give one a feeling of comfortable 3
normality. The landscape hadn't shocked me the day of my visit. . . . There was a 3
dark familiarity and mocking suggestion in it; something tangible, yet distant as 3
the stars beyond the galaxy. 3
3
Theunis came back to earth. "Did you mention three suns in your dreaming 3
orgy?" 3
3
I nodded, frankly puzzled. Then it dawned on me. My fingers trembled slightly 3
as I stared at the picture again. My dream! Of course. . . 3
3
"The others are just like it," Theunis said. "That same uncertainness; that 3
suggestion. I should be able to catch the mood of the thing; see it in its real light, 3
but it is too. . . . Perhaps later I shall find out, if I look at it long enough." 3
3
We sat in silence for some time. A thought came to me, suddenly, prompted by a 3
strange, inexplicable longing to visit the tree again. "Let's make an excursion. I 3
think I can take you there in half a day." 3
3
"You'd better stay away," replied Theunis, thoughtfully. "I doubt if you could 3
find the place again if you wanted to." 3
3
"Nonsense," I replied. "Surely, with these photos to guide us... " 3
3
"Did you see any familiar landmarks in them?" 3
3
His observation was uncanny. After looking through the remaining snaps 3
carefully, I had to admit that there were none. 3
3
3
3
1173 3
3
3
3
Theunis muttered under his breath and drew viciously on his cigarette. "A 3
perfectly normal - or nearly so - picture of a spot apparently dropped from 3
nowhere. Seeing mountains at this low altitude is preposterous . . . but wait!" 3
3
He sprang from the chair as a hunted animal and raced from the room. I could 3
hear him moving about in our makeshift library, cursing volubly. Before long he 3
reappeared with an old, leather-bound volume. Theunis opened it reverently, 3
and peered over the odd characters. 3
3
"What do you call that?" I inquired. 3
3
"This is an early English translation of the Chronicle of Nath, written by Rudolf 3
Yergler, a German mystic and alchemist who borrowed some of his lore from 3
Hermes Trismegistus, the ancient Egyptian sorcerer. There is a passage here that 3
might interest you - might make you understand why this business is even 3
further from the natural than you suspect. Listen." 3
3
"So in the year of the Black Goat there came unto Nath a shadow that should not 3
be on Earth, and that had no form known to the eyes of Earth. And it fed on the 3
souls of men; they that it gnawed being lured and blinded with dreams till the 3
horror and the endless night lay upon them. Nor did they see that which gnawed 3
them; for the shadow took false shapes that men know or dream of, and only 3
freedom seemed waiting in the Land of the Three Suns. But it was told by priests 3
of the Old Book that he who could see the shadow's true shape, and live after the 3
seeing, might shun its doom and send it back to the starless gulf of its spawning. 3
This none could do save through the Gem; wherefore did Ka-Nefer the High- 3
Priest keep that gem sacred in the temple. And when it was lost with Phrenes, he 3
who braved the horror and was never seen more, there was weeping in Nath. Yet 3
did the Shadow depart sated at last, nor shall it hunger again till the cycles roll 3
back to the year of the Black Goat." 3
3
Theunis paused while I stared, bewildered. Finally he spoke. "Now, Single, I 3
suppose you can guess how all this links up. There is no need of going deep into 3
the primal lore behind this business, but I may as well tell you that according to 3
the old legends this is the so-called 'Year of the Black Goat' - when certain 3
horrors from the fathomless Outside are supposed to visit the earth and do 3
infinite harm. We don't know how they'll be manifest, but there's reason to think 3
that strange mirages and hallucinations will be mixed up in the matter. I don't 3
like the thing you've run up against - the story or the pictures. It may be pretty 3
bad, and I warn you to look out. But first I must try to do what old Yergler says - 3
to see if I can glimpse the matter as it is. Fortunately the old Gem he mentions 3
has been rediscovered - I know where I can get at it. We must use it on the 3
photographs and see what we see. 3
3
3
3
1174 3
3
3
3
"It's more or less like a lens or prism, though one can't take photographs with it. 3
Someone of peculiar sensitiveness might look through and sketch what he sees. 3
There's a bit of danger, and the looker may have his consciousness shaken a 3
trifle; for the real shape of the shadow isn't pleasant and doesn't belong on this 3
earth. But it would be a lot more dangerous not to do anything about it. 3
Meanwhile, if you value your life and sanity, keep away from that hill - and from 3
the thing you think is a tree on it." 3
3
I was more bewildered than ever. "How can there be organized beings from the 3
Outside in our midst?" I cried. "How do we know that such things exist?" 3
3
"You reason in terms of this tiny earth," Theunis said. "Surely you don't think 3
that the world is a rule for measuring the universe. There are entities we never 3
dream of floating under our very noses. Modern science is thrusting back the 3
borderland of the unknown and proving that the mystics were not so far off the 3
track. . . " 3
3
Suddenly I knew that I did not want to look at the picture again; I wanted to 3
destroy it. I wanted to run from it. Theunis was suggesting something beyond. . . . 3
A trembling, cosmic fear gripped me and drew me away from the hideous 3
picture, for I was afraid I would recognize some object in it. . . . 3
3
I glanced at my friend. He was poring over the ancient book, a strange 3
expression on his face. He sat up straight. "Let's call the thing off for today. I'm 3
tired of this endless guessing and wondering. I must get the loan of the gem from 3
the museum where it is, and do what is to be done." 3
3
"As you say," I replied. "Will you have to go to Croydon?" 3
3
He nodded. 3
3
"Then we'll both go home," I said decisively. 3
3
III. 3
3
I need not chronicle the events of the fortnight that followed. With me they 3
formed a constant and enervating struggle between a mad longing to return to 3
the cryptic tree of dreams and freedom, and a frenzied dread of that selfsame 3
thing and all connected with it. That I did not return is perhaps less a matter of 3
my own will than a matter of pure chance. Meanwhile I knew that Theunis was 3
desperately active in some investigation of the strangest nature - something 3
which included a mysterious motor trip and a return under circumstances of the 3
greatest secrecy. By hints over the telephone I was made to understand that he 3
had somewhere borrowed the obscure and primal object mentioned in the 3
3
3
3
1175 3
3
3
3
ancient volume as "The Gem/' and that he was busy devising a means of 3
applying it to the photographs I had left with him. He spoke fragmentarily of 3
"refraction," "polarization," and "unknown angles of space and time," and 3
indicated that he was building a kind of box or camera obscura for the study of 3
the curious snapshots with the gem's aid. 3
3
It was on the sixteenth day that I received the startling message from the hospital 3
in Croydon. Theunis was there, and wanted to see me at once. He had suffered 3
some odd sort of seizure; being found prone and unconscious by friends who 3
found their way into his house after hearing certain cries of mortal agony and 3
fear. Though still weak and helpless, he had now regained his senses and seemed 3
frantic to tell me something and have me perform certain important duties. This 3
much the hospital informed me over the wire; and within half an hour I was at 3
my friend's bedside, marveling at the inroads which worry and tension had 3
made on his features in so brief a time. His first act was to move away the nurses 3
in order to speak in utter confidence. 3
3
"Single - I saw it!" His voice was strained and husky. "You must destroy them all 3
- those pictures. I sent it back by seeing it, but the pictures had better go. That 3
tree will never be seen on the hill again - at least, I hope not - till thousands of 3
eons bring back the Year of the Black Goat. You are safe now - mankind is safe." 3
He paused, breathing heavily, and continued. 3
3
"Take the Gem out of the apparatus and put it in the safe - you know the 3
combination. It must go back where it came from, for there's a time when it may 3
be needed to save the world. They won't let me leave here yet, but I can rest if I 3
know it's safe. Don't look through the box as it is - it would fix you as it's fixed 3
me. And burn those damned photographs . . . the one in the box and the others. . 3
. ." But Theunis was exhausted now, and the nurses advanced and motioned me 3
away as he leaned back and closed his eyes. 3
3
In another half-hour I was at his house and looking curiously at the long black 3
box on the library table beside the overturned chair. Scattered papers blew about 3
in a breeze from the open window, and close to the box I recognized with a queer 3
sensation the envelope of pictures I had taken. It required only a moment for me 3
to examine the box and detach at one end my earliest picture of the tree, and at 3
the other end a strange bit of amber-colored crystal, cut in devious angles 3
impossible to classify. The touch of the glass fragment seemed curiously warm 3
and electric, and I could scarcely bear to put it out of sight in Theunis' wall safe. 3
The snapshot I handled with a disconcerting mixture of emotions. Even after I 3
had replaced it in the envelope with the rest I had a morbid longing to save it 3
and gloat over it and rush out and up the hill toward its original. Peculiar line- 3
arrangements sprang out of its details to assault and puzzle my memory . . . 3
3
3
3
1176 3
3
3
3
pictures behind pictures . . . secrets lurking in half-familiar shapes. . . . But a 3
saner contrary instinct, operating at the same time, gave me the vigor and avidity 3
of unplaceable fear as I hastily kindled a fire in the grate and watched the 3
problematic envelope burn to ashes. Somehow I felt that the earth had been 3
purged of a horror on whose brink I had trembled, and which was none the less 3
monstrous because I did not know what it was. 3
3
Of the source of Theunis' terrific shock I could form no coherent guess, nor did I 3
dare to think too closely about it. It is notable that I did not at any time have the 3
least impulse to look through the box before removing the gem and photograph. 3
What was shown in the picture by the antique crystal's lens or prism- like power 3
was not, I felt curiously certain, anything that a normal brain ought to be called 3
upon to face. Whatever it was, I had myself been close to it - had been completely 3
under the spell of its allurement - as it brooded on that remote hill in the form of 3
a tree and an unfamiliar landscape. And I did not wish to know what I had so 3
narrowly escaped. 3
3
Would that my ignorance might have remained complete! I could sleep better at 3
night. As it was, my eye was arrested before I left the room by the pile of 3
scattered papers rustling on the table beside the black box. All but one were 3
blank, but that one bore a crude drawing in pencil. Suddenly recalling what 3
Theunis had once said about sketching the horror revealed by the gem, I strove 3
to turn away; but sheer curiosity defeated my sane design. Looking again almost 3
furtively, I observed the nervous haste of the strokes, and the unfinished edge 3
left by the sketcher's terrified seizure. Then, in a burst of perverse boldness, I 3
looked squarely at the dark and forbidden design - and fell in a faint. 3
3
I shall never describe fully what I saw. After a time I regained my senses, thrust 3
the sheet into the dying fire, and staggered out through the quiet streets to my 3
home. I thanked God that I had not looked through the crystal at the photograph, 3
and prayed fervently that I might forget the drawing's terrible hint of what 3
Theunis had beheld. Since then I have never been quite the same. Even the fairest 3
scenes have seemed to hold some vague, ambiguous hint of the nameless 3
blasphemies which may underlie them and form their masquerading essence. 3
And yet the sketch was so slight. . . so little indicative of all that Theunis, to judge 3
from his guarded accounts later on, must have discerned! 3
3
Only a few basic elements of the landscape were in the thing. For the most part a 3
cloudy, exotic-looking vapor dominated the view. Every object that might have 3
been familiar was seen to be part of something vague and unknown and 3
altogether un-terrestrial - something infinitely vaster than any human eye could 3
grasp, and infinitely alien, monstrous, and hideous as guessed from the fragment 3
within range. 3

3
3
3
Where I had, in the landscape itself, seen the twisted, half-sentient tree, there was 3
here visible only a gnarled, terrible hand or talon with fingers or feelers 3
shockingly distended and evidently groping toward something on the ground or 3
in the spectator's direction. And squarely below the writhing, bloated digits I 3
thought I saw an outline in the grass where a man had lain. But the sketch was 3
hasty, and I could not be sure. 3

3
In a vast room hung with strangely figured arras and carpeted with Bonkhata 3
rugs of impressive age and workmanship, four men were sitting around a 3
document-strewn table. From the far corners, where odd tripods of wrought iron 3
were now and then replenished by an incredibly aged Negro in somber livery, 3
came the hypnotic fumes of olibanum; while in a deep niche on one side there 3
ticked a curious, coffin- shaped clock whose dial bore baffling hieroglyphs and 3
whose four hands did not move in consonance with any time system known on 3
this planet. It was a singular and disturbing room, but well fitted to the business 3
then at hand. For there, in the New Orleans home of this continent's greatest 3
mystic, mathematician and orientalist, there was being settled at last the estate of 3
a scarcely less great mystic, scholar, author and dreamer who had vanished from 3
the face of the earth four years before. 3
3
Randolph Carter, who had all his life sought to escape from the tedium and 3
limitations of waking reality in the beckoning vistas of dreams and fabled 3
avenues of other dimensions, disappeared from the sight of man on the seventh 3
of October, 1928, at the age of fifty-four. His career had been a strange and lonely 3
one, and there were those who inferred from his curious novels many episodes 3
more bizarre than any in his recorded history. His association with Harley 3
Warren, the South Carolina mystic whose studies in the primal Naacal language 3
of the Himalayan priests had led to such outrageous conclusions, had been close. 3
Indeed, it was he who - one mist-mad, terrible night in an ancient graveyard - 3
had seen Warren descend into a dank and nitrous vault, never to emerge. Carter 3
lived in Boston, but it was from the wild, haunted hills behind hoary and witch- 3
accursed Arkham that all his forebears had come. And it was amid these ancient, 3
cryptically brooding hills that he had ultimately vanished. 3
3
His old servant. Parks - who died early in 1930 - had spoken of the strangely 3
aromatic and hideously carven box he had found in the attic, and of the 3
indecipherable parchments and queerly figured silver key which that box had 3
contained: matters of which Carter had also written to others. Carter, he said, 3
had told him that this key had come down from his ancestors, and that it would 3
help him to unlock the gates to his lost boyhood, and to strange dimensions and 3
fantastic realms which he had hitherto visited only in vague, brief, and elusive 3
3
3
3
1179 3
3
3
3
dreams. Then one day Carter took the box and its contents and rode away in his 3
car, never to return. 3
3
Later on, people found the car at the side of an old, grass-grown road in the hills 3
behind crumbling Arkham - the hills where Carter's forebears had once dwelt, 3
and where the ruined cellar of the great Carter homestead still gaped to the sky. 3
It was in a grove of tall elms near by that another of the Carters had mysteriously 3
vanished in 1781, and not far away was the half-rotted cottage where Goody 3
Fowler, the witch, had brewed her ominous potions still earlier. The region had 3
been settled in 1692 by fugitives from the witchcraft trials in Salem, and even 3
now it bore a name for vaguely ominous things scarcely to be envisaged. 3
Edmund Carter had fled from the shadow of Gallows Hill just in time, and the 3
tales of his sorceries were many. Now, it seemed, his lone descendant had gone 3
somewhere to join him! 3
3
In the car they found the hideously carved box of fragrant wood, and the 3
parchment which no man could read. The silver key was gone - presumably with 3
Carter. Further than that there was no certain clue. Detectives from Boston said 3
that the fallen timbers of the old Carter place seemed oddly disturbed, and 3
somebody found a handkerchief on the rock-ridged, sinisterly wooded slope 3
behind the ruins near the dreaded cave called the Snake Den. 3
3
It was then that the country legends about the Snake Den gained a new vitality. 3
Farmers whispered of the blasphemous uses to which old Edmund Carter the 3
wizard had put that horrible grotto, and added later tales about the fondness 3
which Randolph Carter himself hid had for it when a boy. In Carter's boyhood 3
the venerable gambrel-roofed homestead was still standing and tenanted by his 3
great-uncle Christopher. He had visited there often, and had talked singularly 3
about the Snake Den. People remembered what he had said about a deep fissure 3
and an unknown inner cave beyond, and speculated on the change he had 3
shown after spending one whole memorable day in the cavern when he was 3
nine. That was in October, too - and ever after that he had seemed to have a 3
uncanny knack at prophesying future events. 3
3
It had rained late in the night that Carter vanished, and no one was quite able to 3
trace his footprints from the car. Inside the Snake Den all was amorphous liquid 3
mud, owing to the copious seepage. Only the ignorant rustics whispered about 3
the prints they thought they spied where the great elms overhang the road, and 3
on the sinister hillside near the Snake Den, where the handkerchief was found. 3
Who could pay attention to whispers that spoke of stubby little tracks like those 3
which Randolph Carter's square-toed boots made when he was a small boy? It 3
was as crazy a notion as that other whisper - that the tracks of old Benijah 3
Corey's peculiar heelless boots had met the stubby little tracks in the road. Old 3
3
3
3
1180 3
3
3
3
Benijah had been the Carters' hired man when Randolph was young; but he had 3
died thirty years ago. 3
3
It must have been these whispers plus Carter's own statement to Parks and 3
others that the queerly arabesqued silver key would help him unlock the gates of 3
his lost boyhood - which caused a number of mystical students to declare that 3
the missing man had actually doubled back on the trail of time and returned 3
through forty-five years to that other October day in 1883 when he had stayed in 3
the Snake Den as a small boy. When he came out that night, they argued, he had 3
somehow made the whole trip to 1928 and back; for did he not thereafter know 3
of things which were to happen later? And yet he had never spoken of anything 3
to happen after 1928. 3
3
One student - an elderly eccentric of Providence, Rhode Island, who had enjoyed 3
a long and close correspondence with Carter - had a still more elaborate theory, 3
and believed that Carter had not only returned to boyhood, but achieved a 3
further liberation, roving at will through the prismatic vistas of boyhood dream. 3
After a strange vision this man published a tale of Carter's vanishing in which he 3
hinted that the lost one now reigned as king on the opal throne of Ilek-Vad, that 3
fabulous town of turrets atop the hollow cliffs of glass overlooking the twilight 3
sea wherein the bearded and finny Gniorri build their singular labyrinths. 3
3
It was this old man. Ward Phillips, who pleaded most loudly against the 3
apportionment of Carter's estate to his heirs - all distant cousins - on the ground 3
that he was still alive in another time-dimension and might well return some 3
day. Against him was arrayed the legal talent of one of the cousins, Ernest K. 3
Aspinwall of Chicago, a man ten years Carter's senior, but keen as a youth in 3
forensic battles. For four years the contest had raged, but now the time for 3
apportionment had come, and this vast, strange room in New Orleans was to be 3
the scene of the arrangement. 3
3
It was the home of Carter's literary and financial executor - the distinguished 3
Creole student of mysteries and Eastern antiquities, Etienne-Laurent de Marigny. 3
Carter had met de Marigny during the war, when they both served in the French 3
Foreign Legion, and had at once cleaved to him because of their similar tastes 3
and outlook. When, on a memorable joint furlough, the learned young Creole 3
had taken the wistful Boston dreamer to Bayonne, in the south of France, and 3
had shown him certain terrible secrets in the nighted and immemorial crypts that 3
burrow beneath that brooding, eon-weighted city, the friendship was forever 3
sealed. Carter's will had named de Marigny as executor, and now that avid 3
scholar was reluctantly presiding over the settlement of the estate. It was sad 3
work for him, for like the old Rhode Islander he did not believe that Carter was 3
3
3
3
1181 3
3
3
3
dead. But what weight had the dreams of mystics against the harsh wisdom of 3
the world? 3
3
Around the table in that strange room in the old French Quarter sat the men who 3
claimed an interest in the proceedings. There had been the usual legal 3
advertisements of the conference in papers wherever Carter's heirs were thought 3
to live; yet only four now sat listening to the abnormal ticking of that coffin- 3
shaped clock which told no earthly time, and to the bubbling of the courtyard 3
fountain beyond half-curtained, fan- lighted windows. As the hours wore on, the 3
faces of the four were half shrouded in the curling fumes from the tripods, 3
which, piled recklessly with fuel, seemed to need less and less attention from the 3
silently gliding and increasingly nervous old Negro. 3
3
There was Etienne de Marigny himself - slim, dark, handsome, mustached, and 3
still young. Aspinwall, representing the heirs, was white-haired, apoplectic- 3
faced, side-whiskered, and portly. Phillips, the Providence mystic, was lean, 3
gray, long-nosed, clean-shaven, and stoop-shouldered. The fourth man was non- 3
committal in age - lean, with a dark, bearded, singularly immobile face of very 3
regular contour, bound with the turban of a high-caste Brahman and having 3
night-black, burning, almost irisless eyes which seemed to gaze out from a vast 3
distance behind the features. He had announced himself as the Swami 3
Chandraputra, an adept from Benares, with important information to give; and 3
both de Marigny and Phillips - who had corresponded with him - had been quick 3
to recognize the genuineness of his mystical pretensions. His speech had an 3
oddly forced, hollow, metallic quality, as if the use of English taxed his vocal 3
apparatus; yet his language was as easy, correct and idiomatic as any native 3
Anglo- Saxon's. In general attire he was the normal European civilian, but his 3
loose clothes sat peculiarly badly on him, while his bushy black beard. Eastern 3
turban, and large, white mittens gave him an air of exotic eccentricity. 3
3
De Marigny, fingering the parchment found in Carter's car, was speaking. 3
3
"No, I have not been able to make anything of the parchment. Mr. Phillips, here, 3
also gives it up. Colonel Churchward declares it is not Naacal, and it looks 3
nothing at all like the hieroglyphics on that Easter Island war-club. The carvings 3
on that box, though, do strangely suggest Easter Island images. The nearest thing 3
I can recall to these parchment characters - notice how all the letters seem to hang 3
down from horizontal word-bar - is the writing in a book poor Harley Warren 3
once had. It came from India while Carter and I were visiting him in 1919, and he 3
never would tell us anything about it - said it would be better if we didn't know, 3
and hinted that it might have come originally from some place other than the 3
Earth. He took it with him in December, when he went down into the vault in 3
that old graveyard - but neither he nor the book ever came to the surface again. 3
3
3
3
1182 3
3
3
3
Some time ago I sent our friend here - the Swami Chandraputra - a memory- 3
sketch of some of those letters, and also a photostatic copy of the Carter 3
parchment. He believes he may be able to shed light on them after certain 3
references and consultations. 3
3
"But the key - Carter sent me a photograph of that. Its curious arabesques were 3
not letters, but seem to have belonged to the same culture-tradition as the 3
parchment Carter always spoke of being on the point of solving the mystery, 3
though he never gave details. Once he grew almost poetic about the whole 3
business. That antique silver key, he said, would unlock the successive doors that 3
bar our free march down the mighty corridors of space and time to the very 3
Border which no man has crossed since Shaddad with his terrific genius built 3
and concealed in the sands of Arabia Pettraea the prodigious domes and 3
uncounted minarets of thousand-pillared Irem. Half-starved dervishes - wrote 3
Carter - and thirst-crazed nomads have returned to tell of that monumental 3
portal, and of the hand that is sculptured above the keystone of the arch, but no 3
man has passed and retraced his steps to say that his footprints on the garnet- 3
strewn sands within bear witness to his visit. The key, he surmised, was that for 3
which the Cyclopean sculptured hand vainly grasps. 3
3
"Why Carter didn't take the parchment as well as the key, we can not say. 3
Perhaps he forgot it - or perhaps he forbore to take it through recollection of one 3
who had taken a book of like characters into a vault and never returned. Or 3
perhaps it was really immaterial to what he wished to do." 3
3
As de Marigny paused, old Mr. Phillips spoke a harsh, shrill voice. 3
3
"We can know of Randolph Carter's wandering only what we dream. I have 3
been to many strange places in dreams, and have heard many strange and 3
significant things in Ulthar, beyond the River Skai. It does not appear that the 3
parchment was needed, for certainly Carter reentered the world of his boyhood 3
dreams, and is now a king in Ilek-Vad." 3
3
Mr. Aspinwall grew doubly apoplectic-looking as he sputtered: "Can't 3
somebody shut the old fool up? We've had enough of these moonings. The 3
problem is to divide the property, and it's about time we got to it." 3
3
For the first time Swami Chandraputra spoke in his queerly alien voice. 3
3
"Gentlemen, there is more to this matter than you think. Mr. Aspinwall does not 3
do well to laugh at the evidence of dreams. Mr. Phillips has taken an incomplete 3
view - perhaps because he has not dreamed enough. I, myself, have done much 3
dreaming. We in India have always done that, just as all the Carters seem to have 3
3
3
3
1183 3
3
3
3
done it. You, Mr. Aspinwall, as a maternal cousin, are naturally not a Carter. My 3
own dreams, and certain other sources of information, have told me a great deal 3
which you still find obscure. For example, Randolph Carter forgot that 3
parchment which he couldn't decipher - yet it would have been well for him had 3
he remembered to take it. You see, I have really learned pretty much what 3
happened to Carter after he left his car with the silver key at sunset on that 3
seventh of October, four years ago." 3
3
Aspinwall audibly sneered, but the others sat up with heightened interest. The 3
smoke from the tripods increased, and the crazy ticking of that coffin-shaped 3
clock seemed to fall into bizarre patterns like the dots and dashes of some alien 3
and insoluble telegraph message from outer space. The Hindoo leaned back, half 3
closed his eyes, and continued in that oddly labored yet idiomatic speech, while 3
before his audience there began to float a picture of what had happened to 3
Randolph Carter. 3
3
Chapter Two 3
3
The hills beyond Arkham are full of a strange magic - something, perhaps, which 3
the old wizard Edmund Carter called down from the stars and up from the 3
crypts of nether earth when he fled there from Salem in 1692. As soon as 3
Randolph Carter was back among them he knew that he was close to one of the 3
gates which a few audacious, abhorred and alien-souled men have blasted 3
through titan walls betwixt the world and the outside absolute. Here, he felt, and 3
on this day of the year, he could carry out with success the message he had 3
deciphered months before from the arabesques of that tarnished and incredibly 3
ancient silver key. He knew now how it must be rotated, and how it must be held 3
up to the setting sun, and what syllables of ceremony must be intoned into the 3
void at the ninth and last turning. In a spot as close to a dark polarity and 3
induced gate as this, it could not fail in its primary functions Certainly, he would 3
rest that night in the lost boyhood for which he had never ceased to mourn. 3
3
He got out of the car with the key in his pocket, walking up-hill deeper and 3
deeper into the shadowy core of that brooding, haunted countryside of winding 3
road, vine-grown stone wall, black woodland, gnarled, neglected orchard, 3
gaping-windowed, deserted farm-house, and nameless nun. At the sunset hour, 3
when the distant spires of Kingsport gleamed in the ruddy blaze, he took out the 3
key and made the needed turnings and intonations. Only later did he realize 3
how soon the ritual had taken effect. 3
3
Then in the deepening twilight he had heard a voice out of the past: Old Benijah 3
Corey, his great-uncle's hired man. Had not old Benijah been dead for thirty 3
years? Thirty years before when. What was time? Where had he been? Why was 3
3
3
3
1184 3
3
3
3
it strange that Benijah should be caUing him on this seventh of October 1883? 3
Was he not out later than Aunt Martha had told him to stay? What was this key 3
in his blouse pocket, where his little telescope - given him by his father on his 3
ninth birthday, two months before - ought to be? Had he found it in the attic at 3
home? Would it unlock the mystic pylon which his sharp eye had traced amidst 3
the jagged rocks at the back of that inner cave behind the Snake Den on the hill? 3
That was the place they always coupled with old Edmund Carter the wizard. 3
People wouldn't go there, and nobody but him had ever noticed or squirmed 3
through the root-choked fissure to that great black inner chamber with the pylon. 3
Whose hands had carved that hint of a pylon out of the living rock? Old Wizard 3
Edmund's - or others that he had conjured up and commanded? 3
3
That evening little Randolph ate supper with Uncle Chris and Aunt Martha in 3
the old gambrel-roofed farm-house. 3
3
Next morning he was up early and out through the twisted-boughed apple 3
orchard to the upper timber lot where the mouth of the Snake Den lurked black 3
and forbidding amongst grotesque, overnourished oaks. A nameless expectancy 3
was upon him, and he did not even notice the loss of his handkerchief as he 3
fumbled in his blouse pocket to see if the queer silver key was safe. He crawled 3
through the dark orifice with tense, adventurous assurance, lighting his way 3
with matches taken from the sitting-room. In another moment he had wriggled 3
through the root-choked fissure at the farther end, and was in the vast, unknown 3
inner grotto whose ultimate rock wall seemed half like a monstrous and 3
consciously shapen pylon. Before that dank, dripping wall he stood silent and 3
awestruck, lighting one match after another as he gazed. Was that stony bulge 3
above the keystone of the imagined arch really a gigantic sculptured hand? Then 3
he drew forth the silver key, and made motions and intonations whose source he 3
could only dimly remember. Was anything forgotten? He knew only that he 3
wished to cross the barrier to the untrammeled land of his dreams and the gulfs 3
where all dimensions dissolved in the absolute. 3
3
Chapter Three 3
3
What happened then is scarcely to be described in words. It is full of those 3
paradoxes, contradictions and anomalies which have no place in waking life, but 3
which fill our more fantastic dreams and are taken as matters of course till we 3
return to our narrow, rigid, objective world of limited causation and tri- 3
dimensional logic. As the Hindoo continued his tale, he had difficulty in 3
avoiding what seemed - even more than the notion of a man transferred through 3
the years to boyhood - an air of trivial, puerile extravagance. Mr. Aspinwall, in 3
disgust, gave an apoplectic snort and virtually stopped listening. 3
3
3
3
1185 3
3
3
3
For the rite of the silver key, as practiced by Randolph Carter in that black, 3
haunted cave within a cave, did not prove unavailing. From the first gesture and 3
syllable an aura of strange, awesome mutation was apparent - a sense of 3
incalculable disturbance and confusion in time and space, yet one which held no 3
hint of what we recognize as motion and duration. Imperceptibly, such things as 3
age and location ceased to have any significance whatever. The day before, 3
Randolph Carter had miraculously leaped a gulf of years. Now there was no 3
distinction between boy and man. There was only the entity Randolph Carter, 3
with a certain store of images which had lost all connection with terrestrial 3
scenes and circumstances of acquisition. A moment before, there had been an 3
inner cave with vague suggestions of a monstrous arch and gigantic sculptured 3
hand on the farther wall. Now there was neither cave nor absence of cave; 3
neither wall nor absence of wall. There was only a flux of impressions not so 3
much visual as cerebral, amidst which the entity that was Randolph Carter 3
experienced perceptions or registrations of all that his mind revolved on, yet 3
without any clear consciousness of the way in which he received them. 3
3
By the time the rite was over. Carter knew that he was in no region whose place 3
could be told by Earth's geographers, and in no age whose date history could fix; 3
for the nature of what was happening was not wholly unfamiliar to him. There 3
were hints of it in the cryptical Pnakotic fragments, and a whole chapter in the 3
forbidden Necronomicon of the mad Arab, Abdul Alhazred, had taken on 3
significance when he had deciphered the designs graven on the silver key. A gate 3
had been unlocked - not, indeed, the Ultimate Gate, but one leading from Earth 3
and time to that extension of Earth which is outside time, and from which in turn 3
the Ultimate Gate leads fearsomely and perilously to the last Void which is 3
outside all earths, all universes, and all matter. 3
3
There would be a Guide - and a very terrible one; a Guide who had been an 3
entity of Earth millions of years before, when man was undreamed of, and when 3
forgotten shapes moved on a steaming planet building strange cities among 3
whose last, crumbling ruins the first mammals were to play. Carter remembered 3
what the monstrous Necronomicon had vaguely and disconcertingly 3
adumbrated concerning that Guide: 3
3
"And while there are those," the mad Arab had written, "who have dared to seek 3
glimpses beyond the Veil, and to accept HIM as guide, they would have been 3
more prudent had they avoided commerce with HIM; for it is written in the Book 3
of Thoth how terrific is the price of a single glimpse. Nor may those who pass 3
ever return, for in the vastnesses transcending our world are shapes of darkness 3
that seize and bind. The Affair that shambleth about in the night, the evil that 3
defieth the Elder Sign, the Herd that stand watch at the secret portal each tomb is 3
known to have and that thrive on that which groweth out of the tenants thereof: - 3
3
3
3
1186 3
3
3
3
all these Blacknesses are lesser than HE WHO guardeth the Gateway: HE WHO 3
will guide the rash one beyond all the worlds into the Abyss of unnamable 3
devourers. For He is 'UMR AT- TAWIL, the Most Ancient One, which the scribe 3
rendereth as THE PROLONGED OF LIFE." 3
3
Memory and imagination shaped dim half-pictures with uncertain outlines 3
amidst the seething chaos, but Carter knew that they were of memory and 3
imagination only. Yet he felt that it was not chance which built these things in his 3
consciousness, but rather some vast reality, ineffable and undimensioned, which 3
surrounded him and strove to translate itself into the only symbols he was 3
capable of grasping. For no mind of Earth may grasp the extensions of shape 3
which interweave in the oblique gulfs outside time and the dimensions we know. 3
3
There floated before Carter a cloudy pageantry of shapes and scenes which he 3
somehow linked with Earth's primal, eon-forgotten past. Monstrous living things 3
moved deliberately through vistas of fantastic handiwork that no sane dream 3
ever held, and landscapes bore incredible vegetation and cliffs and mountains 3
and masonry of no human pattern. There were cities under the sea, and denizens 3
thereof; and towers in great deserts where globes and cylinders and nameless 3
winged entities shot off into space, or hurtled down out of space. All this Carter 3
grasped, though the images bore no fixed relation to one another or to him. He 3
himself had no stable form or position, but only such shifting hints of form and 3
position as his whirling fancy supplied. 3
3
He had wished to find the enchanted regions of his boyhood dreams, where 3
galleys sail up the river Oukranos past the gilded spires of Thran, and elephant 3
caravans tramp through perfumed jungles in Kied, beyond forgotten palaces 3
with veined ivory columns that sleep lovely and unbroken under the moon. 3
Now, intoxicated with wider visions, he scarcely knew what he sought. 3
Thoughts of infinite and blasphemous daring rose in his mind, and he knew he 3
would face the dreaded Guide without fear, asking monstrous and terrible things 3
of him. 3
3
All at once the pageant of impressions seemed to achieve a vague kind of 3
stabilization. There were great masses of towering stone, carven into alien and 3
incomprehensible designs and disposed according to the laws of some unknown, 3
inverse geometry. Light filtered from a sky of no assignable colour in baffling, 3
contradictory directions, and played almost sentiently over what seemed to be a 3
curved line of gigantic hieroglyphed pedestals more hexagonal than otherwise, 3
and surmounted by cloaked, ill-defined shapes. 3
3
There was another shape, too, which occupied no pedestal, but which seemed to 3
glide or float over the cloudy, floor-like lower level. It was not exactly permanent 3
3
3
3
1187 3
3
3
3
in outline, but held transient suggestions of something remotely preceding or 3
paralleling the human form, though half as large again as an ordinary man. It 3
seemed to be heavily cloaked, like the shapes on the pedestals, with some 3
neutral-coloured fabric; and Carter could not detect any eye-holes through which 3
it might gaze. Probably it did not need to gaze, for it seemed to belong to an 3
order of beings far outside the merely physical in organization and faculties. 3
3
A moment later Carter knew that this was so, for the Shape had spoken to his 3
mind without sound or language. And though the name it uttered was a dreaded 3
and terrible one, Randolph Carter did not flinch in fear. 3
3
Instead, he spoke back, equally without sound or language, and made those 3
obeisances which the hideous Necronomicon had taught him to make. For this 3
shape was nothing less than that which all the world has feared since Lomar rose 3
out of the sea, and the Children of the Fire Mist came to Earth to teach the Elder 3
Lore to man. It was indeed the frightful Guide and Guardian of the Gate - 'UMR 3
AT-TAWIL, the ancient one, which the scribe rendereth the PROLONGED OF 3
LIFE. 3
3
The Guide knew, as he knew all things, of Carter's quest and coming, and that 3
this seeker of dreams and secrets stood before him unafraid. There was no horror 3
or malignity in what he radiated, and Carter wondered for a moment whether 3
the mad Arab's terrific blasphemous hints came from envy and a baffled wish to 3
do what was now about to be done. Or perhaps the Guide reserved his horror 3
and malignity for those who feared. As the radiations continued. Carter 3
eventually interpreted them in the form of words. 3
3
"I am indeed that Most Ancient One," said the Guide, "of whom you know. We 3
have awaited you - the Ancient Ones and I. You are welcome, even though long 3
delayed. You have the key, and have unlocked the First Gate. Now the Ultimate 3
Gate is ready for your trial. If you fear, you need not advance. You may still go 3
back unharmed, the way you came. But if you chose to advance -" 3
3
The pause was ominous, but the radiations continued to be friendly. Carter 3
hesitated not a moment, for a burning curiosity drove him on. 3
3
"I will advance," he radiated back, "and I accept you as my Guide." 3
3
At this reply the Guide seemed to make a sign by certain motions of his robe 3
which may or may not have involved the lifting of an arm or some homologous 3
member. A second sign followed, and from his well- learned lore Carter knew 3
that he was at last very close to the Ultimate Gate. The light now changed to 3
another inexplicable colour, and the shapes on the quasi-hexagonal pedestals 3
3
3
3
1188 3
3
3
3
became more clearly defined. As they sat more erect, their outlines became more 3
like those of men, though Carter knew that they could not be men. Upon their 3
cloaked heads there now seemed to rest tall, uncertainly coloured miters, 3
strangely suggestive of those on certain nameless figures chiseled by a forgotten 3
sculptor along the living cliffs of a high, forbidden mountain in Tartary; while 3
grasped in certain folds of their swathings were long sceptres whose carven 3
heads bodied forth a grotesque and archaic mystery. 3
3
Carter guessed what they were and whence they came, and Whom they served; 3
and guessed, too, the price of their service. But he was still content, for at one 3
mighty venture he was to learn all. Damnation, he reflected, is but a word 3
bandied about by those whose blindness leads them to condemn all who can see, 3
even with a single eye. He wondered at the vast conceit of those who had 3
babbled of the malignant Ancient Ones, as if They could pause from their 3
everlasting dreams to wreack a wrath on mankind. As well, he might a 3
mammoth pause to visit frantic vengeance on an angleworm. Now the whole 3
assemblage on the vaguely hexagonal pillars was greeting him with a gesture of 3
those oddly carven sceptres and radiating a message which he understood: 3
3
"We salute you. Most Ancient One, and you, Randolph Carter, whose daring has 3
made you one of us." 3
3
Carter saw now that one of the pedestals was vacant, and a gesture of the Most 3
Ancient One told him it was reserved for him. He saw also another pedestal, 3
taller than the rest, and at the center of the oddly curved line - neither semicircle 3
nor ellipse, parabola nor hyperbola - which they formed. This, he guessed, was 3
the Guide's own throne. Moving and rising in a manner hardly definable. Carter 3
took his seat; and as he did so he saw that the Guide had seated himself. 3
3
Gradually and mistily it became apparent that the Most Ancient One was 3
holding something - some object clutched in the outflung folds of his robe as if 3
for the sight, or what answered for sight, of the cloaked Companions. It was a 3
large sphere, or apparent sphere, of some obscurely iridescent metal, and as the 3
Guide put it forward a low, pervasive half-impression of sound began to rise and 3
fall in intervals which seemed to be rhythmic even though they followed no 3
rhythm of Earth. There was a suggestion of chanting or what human imagination 3
might interpret as chanting. Presently the quasi-sphere began to grow luminous, 3
and as it gleamed up into a cold, pulsating light of unassignable colour. Carter 3
saw that its flickerings conformed to the alien rhythm of the chant. Then all the 3
mitered, scepter-bearing Shapes on the pedestals commenced a slight, curious 3
swaying in the same inexplicable rhythm, while nimbuses of unclassifiable light - 3
resembling that of the quasi-sphere - played around their shrouded heads. 3
3
3
3
1189 3
3
3
3
The Hindoo paused in his tale and looked curiously at the tall, coffin-shaped 3
clock with the four hands and hieroglyphed dial, whose crazy ticking followed 3
no known rhythm of Earth. 3
3
"You, Mr. de Marigny," he suddenly said to his learned host, "do not need to be 3
told the particularly alien rhythm to which those cowled Shapes on the 3
hexagonal pillars chanted and nodded. You are the only one else - in America - 3
who has had a taste of the Outer Extension. That clock - 1 suppose it was sent to 3
you by the Yogi poor Harley Warren used to talk about — the seer who said that 3
he alone of living men had been to Yian-Ho, the hidden legacy of eon-old Leng, 3
and had borne certain things away from that dreadful and forbidden city. I 3
wonder how many of its subtler properties you know? If my dreams and 3
readings be correct, it was made by those who knew much of the First Gateway. 3
But let me go on with my tale." 3
3
At last, continued the Swami, the swaying and the suggestion of chanting ceased, 3
the lambent nimbuses around the now drooping and motionless heads faded, 3
while the cloaked shapes slumped curiously on their pedestals. The quasi- 3
sphere, however, continued to pulsate with inexplicable light. Carter felt that the 3
Ancient Ones were sleeping as they had been when he first saw them, and he 3
wondered out of what cosmic dreams his coming had aroused them. Slowly 3
there filtered into his mind the truth that this strange chanting ritual had been 3
one of instruction, and that the Companions had been chanted by the Most 3
Ancient One into a new and peculiar kind of sleep in order that their dreams 3
might open the Ultimate Gate to which the silver key was a passport. He knew 3
that in the profundity of this deep sleep they were contemplating unplumbed 3
vastnesses of utter and absolute outsideness, and that they were to accomplish 3
that which his presence had demanded. 3
3
The Guide did not share this sleep, but seemed still to be giving instructions in 3
some subtle, soundless way. Evidently he was implanting images of those things 3
which he wished the Companions to dream: and Carter knew that as each of the 3
Ancient Ones pictured the prescribed thought, there would be born the nucleus 3
of a manifestation visible to his earthly eyes. When the dreams of all the Shapes 3
had achieved a oneness, that manifestation would occur, and everything he 3
required be materialized, through concentration. He had seen such things on 3
Earth - in India, where the combined, projected will of a circle of adepts can 3
make a thought take tangible substance, and in hoary Atlaanat, of which few 3
even dare speak. 3
3
Just what the Ultimate Gate was, and how it was to be passed. Carter could not 3
be certain; but a feeling of tense expectancy surged over him. He was conscious 3
of having a kind of body, and of holding the fateful silver key in his hand. The 3
3
3
3
1190 3
3
3
3
masses of towering stone opposite him seemed to possess the evenness of a wall, 3
toward the centre of which his eyes were irresistibly drawn. And then suddenly 3
he felt the mental currents of the Most Ancient One cease to flow forth. 3
3
For the first time Carter realized how terrific utter silence, mental and physical, 3
may be. The earlier moments had never failed to contain some perceptible 3
rhythm, if only the faint, cryptical pulse of the Earth's dimensional extension, but 3
now the hush of the abyss seemed to fall upon everything. Despite his 3
intimations of body, he had no audible breath, and the glow of 'Umr at-Tawil's 3
quasi-sphere had grown petrifiedly fixed and unpulsating. A potent nimbus, 3
brighter than those which had played round the heads of the Shapes, blazed 3
frozenly over the shrouded skull of the terrible Guide. 3
3
A dizziness assailed Carter, and his sense of lost orientation waxed a 3
thousandfold. The strange lights seemed to hold the quality of the most 3
impenetrable blacknesses heaped upon blacknesses while about the Ancient 3
Ones, so close on their pseudo-hexagonal thrones, there hovered an air of the 3
most stupefying remoteness. Then he felt himself wafted into immeasurable 3
depths, with waves of perfumed warmth lapping against his face. It was as if he 3
floated in a torrid, rose-tinctured sea; a sea of drugged wine whose waves broke 3
foaming against shores of brazen fire. A great fear clutched him as he half saw 3
that vast expanse of surging sea lapping against its far off coast. But the moment 3
of silence was broken - the surgings were speaking to him in a language that was 3
not of physical sound or articulate words. 3
3
"The Man of Truth is beyond good and evil," intoned the voice that was not a 3
voice. 'The Man of Truth has ridden to AU-Is-One. The Man of Truth has learned 3
that Illusion is the One Reality, and that Substance is the Great Impostor." 3
3
And now, in that rise of masonry to which his eyes had been so irresistibly 3
drawn, there appeared the outline of a titanic arch not unlike that which he 3
thought he had glimpsed so long ago in that cave within a cave, on the far, 3
unreal surface of the three-dimensioned Earth. He realized that he had been 3
using the silver key - moving it in accord with an unlearned and instinctive ritual 3
closely akin to that which had opened the Inner Gate. That rose-drunken sea 3
which lapped his cheeks was, he realized, no more or less than the adamantine 3
mass of the solid wall yielding before his spell, and the vortex of thought with 3
which the Ancient Ones had aided his spell. Still guided by instinct and blind 3
determination, he floated forward - and through the Ultimate Gate. 3
3

3
3
3
Randolph Carter's advance through the cyclopean bulk of masonry was like a 3
dizzy precipitation through the measureless gulfs between the stars. From a 3
great distance he felt triumphant, godlike surges of deadly sweetness, and after 3
that the rustling of great wings, and impressions of sound like the chirpings and 3
murmurings of objects unknown on Earth or in the solar system. Glancing 3
backward, he saw not one gate alone but a multiplicity of gates, at some of which 3
clamoured Forms he strove not to remember. 3
3
And then, suddenly, he felt a greater terror than that which any of the Forms 3
could give - a terror from which he could not flee because it was connected with 3
himself. Even the First Gateway had taken something of stability from him, 3
leaving him uncertain about his bodily form and about his relationship to the 3
mistily defined objects around him, but it had not disturbed his sense of unity. 3
He had still been Randolph Carter, a fixed point in the dimensional seething. 3
Now, beyond the Ultimate Gateway, he realized in a moment of consuming 3
fright that he was not one person, but many persons. 3
3
He was in many places at the same time. On Earth, on October 7, 1883, a little 3
boy named Randolph Carter was leaving the Snake Den in the hushed evening 3
light and running down the rocky slope, and through the twisted-boughed 3
orchard toward his Uncle Christopher's house in the hills beyond Arkham; yet at 3
that same moment, which was also somehow in the earthly year of 1928, a vague 3
shadow not less Randolph Carter was sitting on a pedestal among the Ancient 3
Ones in Earth's transdimensional extension. Here, too, was a third Randolph 3
Carter, in the unknown and formless cosmic abyss beyond the Ultimate Gate. 3
And elsewhere, in a chaos of scenes whose infinite multiplicity and monstrous 3
diversity brought him close to the brink of madness, were a limitless confusion of 3
beings which he knew were as much himself as the local manifestation now 3
beyond the Ultimate Gate. 3
3
There were Carters in settings belonging to every known and suspected age of 3
Earth's history, and to remoter ages of earthly entity transcending knowledge, 3
suspicion, and credibility; Carters of forms both human and non-human, 3
vertebrate and invertebrate, conscious and mindless, animal and vegetable. And 3
more, there were Carters having nothing in common with earthly life, but 3
moving outrageously amidst backgrounds of other planets and systems and 3
galaxies and cosmic continua; spores of eternal life drifting from world to world, 3
universe to universe, yet all equally himself. Some of the glimpses recalled 3
dreams - both faint and vivid, single and persistent - which he had had through 3
the long years since he first began to dream; and a few possessed a haunting, 3
fascinating and almost horrible familiarity which no earthly logic could explain. 3
3
3
3
1192 3
3
3
3
Faced with this reahzation, Randolph Carter reeled in the clutch of supreme 3
horror - horror such as had not been hinted even at the climax of that hideous 3
night when two had ventured into an ancient and abhorred necropolis under a 3
waning moon and only one had emerged. No death, no doom, no anguish can 3
arouse the surpassing despair which flows from a loss of identity. Merging with 3
nothingness is peaceful oblivion; but to be aware of existence and yet to know 3
that one is no longer a definite being distinguished from other beings - that one 3
no longer has a self - that is the nameless summit of agony and dread. 3
3
He knew that there had been a Randolph Carter of Boston, yet could not be sure 3
whether he - the fragment or facet of an entity beyond the Ultimate Gate - had 3
been that one or some other. His self had been annihilated; and yet he - if indeed 3
there could, in view of that utter nullity of individual existence, be such a thing 3
as he - was equally aware of being in some inconceivable way a legion of selves. 3
It was as though his body had been suddenly transformed into one of those 3
many-limbed and many-headed effigies sculptured in Indian temples, and he 3
contemplated the aggregation in a bewildered attempt to discern which was the 3
original and which the additions - if indeed (supremely monstrous thought!) 3
there were any original as distinguished from other embodiments. 3
3
Then, in the midst of these devastating reflections. Carter's beyond-the-gate 3
fragment was hurled from what had seemed the nadir of horror to black, 3
clutching pits of a horror still more profound. This time it was largely external - a 3
force of personality which at once confronted and surrounded and pervaded 3
him, and which in addition to its local presence, seemed also to be a part of 3
himself, and likewise to be co- existent with all time and conterminous with all 3
space. There was no visual image, yet the sense of entity and the awful concept 3
of combined localism and identity and infinity lent a paralyzing terror beyond 3
anything which any Carter-fragment had hitherto deemed capable of existing. 3
3
In the face of that awful wonder, the quasi-Carter forgot the horror of destroyed 3
individuality. It was an All-in-One and One-in-All of limitless being and self - 3
not merely a thing of one space-time continuum, but allied to the ultimate 3
animating essence of existence's whole unbounded sweep - the last, utter sweep 3
which has no confines and which outreaches fancy and mathematics alike. It was 3
perhaps that which certain secret cults of Earth had whispered of as Yog-Sothoth, 3
and which has been a deity under other names; that which the crustaceans of 3
Yuggoth worship as the Beyond-One, and which the vaporous brains of the 3
spiral nebulae know by an untranslatable sign - yet in a flash the Carter-facet 3
realized how slight and fractional all these conceptions are. 3
3
And now the Being was addressing the Carter-facet in prodigious waves that 3
smote and burned and thundered - a concentration of energy that blasted its 3
3
3
3
1193 3
3
3
3
recipient with well-nigh unendurable violence, and that paralleled in an 3
unearthly rhythm the curious swaying of the Ancient Ones, and the flickering of 3
the monstrous lights, in that baffling region beyond the First Gate. It was as 3
though suns and worlds and universes had converged upon one point whose 3
very position in space they had conspired to annihilate with an impact of 3
resistless fury. But amidst the greater terror one lesser terror was diminished; for 3
the searing waves appeared somehow to isolate the Beyond-the-Gate Carter from 3
his infinity of duplicates - to restore, as it were, a certain amount of the illusion of 3
identity. After a time the hearer began to translate the waves into speech-forms 3
known to him, and his sense of horror and oppression waned. Fright became 3
pure awe, and what had seemed blasphemously abnormal seemed now only 3
ineffably majestic. 3
3
"Randolph Carter," it seemed to say, "my manifestations on your planet's 3
extension, the Ancient Ones, have sent you as one who would lately have 3
returned to small lands of dream which he had lost, yet who with greater 3
freedom has risen to greater and nobler desires and curiosities. You wished to 3
sail up golden Oukranos, to search out forgotten ivory cities in orchid-heavy 3
Kied, and to reign on the opal throne of Ilek- Vad, whose fabulous towers and 3
numberless domes rise mighty toward a single red star in a firmament alien to 3
your Earth and to all matter. Now, with the passing of two Gates, you wish 3
loftier things. You would not flee like a child from a scene disliked to a dream 3
beloved, but would plunge like a man into that last and inmost of secrets which 3
lies behind all scenes and dreams. 3
3
"What you wish, I have found good; and I am ready to grant that which I have 3
granted eleven times only to beings of your planet - five times only to those you 3
call men, or those resembling them. I am ready to show you the Ultimate 3
Mystery, to look on which is to blast a feeble spirit. Yet before you gaze full at 3
that last and first of secrets you may still wield a free choice, and return if you 3
will through the two Gates with the Veil still unrent before our eyes." 3
3
Chapter Five 3
3
A sudden shutting-off of the waves left Carter in a chilling and awesome silence 3
full of the spirit of desolation. On every hand pressed the illimitable vastness of 3
the void; yet the seeker knew that the Being was still there. After a moment he 3
thought of words whose mental substance he flung into the abyss: "I accept. I 3
will not retreat." 3
3
The waves surged forth again, and Carter knew that the Being had heard. And 3
now there poured from that limitless Mind a flood of knowledge and 3
explanation which opened new vistas to the seeker, and prepared him for such a 3
3
3
3
1194 3
3
3
3
grasp of the cosmos as he had never hoped to possess. He was told how childish 3
and limited is the notion of a tri-dimensional world, and what an infinity of 3
directions there are besides the known directions of up-down, forward- 3
backward, right-left. He was shown the smallness and tinsel emptiness of the 3
little Earth gods, with their petty, human interests and connections - their 3
hatreds, rages, loves and vanities; their craving for praise and sacrifice, and their 3
demands for faiths contrary to reason and nature. 3
3
While most of the impressions translated themselves to Carter as words there 3
were others to which other senses gave interpretation. Perhaps with eyes and 3
perhaps with imagination he perceived that he was in a region of dimensions 3
beyond those conceivable to the eye and brain of man. He saw now, in the 3
brooding shadows of that which had been first a vortex of power and then an 3
illimitable void, a sweep of creation that dizzied his senses. From some 3
inconceivable vantagepoint he looked upon prodigious forms whose multiple 3
extensions transcended any conception of being, size and boundaries which his 3
mind had hitherto been able to hold, despite a lifetime of cryptical study. He 3
began to understand dimly why there could exist at the same time the little boy 3
Randolph Carter in the Arkham farm-house in 1883, the misty form on the 3
vaguely hexagonal pillar beyond the First Gate, the fragment now facing the 3
Presence in the limitless abyss, and all the other Carters his fancy or perception 3
envisaged. 3
3
Then the waves increased in strength and sought to improve his understanding, 3
reconciling him to the multiform entity of which his present fragment was an 3
infinitesimal part. They told him that every figure of space is but the result of the 3
intersection by a plane of some corresponding figure of one more dimension - as 3
a square is cut from a cube, or a circle from a sphere. The cube and sphere, of 3
three dimensions, are thus cut from corresponding forms of four dimensions, 3
which men know only through guesses and dreams; and these in turn are cut 3
from forms of five dimensions, and so on up to the dizzy and reachless heights of 3
archetypal infinity. The world of men and of the gods of men is merely an 3
infinitesimal phase of an infinitesimal thing - the three-dimensional phase of that 3
small wholeness reached by the First Gate, where 'Umr at-Tawil dictates dreams 3
to the Ancient Ones. Though men hail it as reality, and band thoughts of its 3
many-dimensioned original as unreality, it is in truth the very opposite. That 3
which we call substance and reality is shadow and illusion, and that which we 3
call shadow and illusion is substance and reality. 3
3
Time, the waves went on, is motionless, and without beginning or end. That it 3
has motion and is the cause of change is an illusion. Indeed, it is itself really an 3
illusion, for except to the narrow sight of beings in limited dimensions there are 3
no such things as past, present and future. Men think of time only because of 3
3
3
3
1195 3
3
3
3
what they call change, yet that too is illusion. All that was, and is, and is to be, 3
exists simultaneously. 3
3
These revelations came with a god like solemnity which left Carter unable to 3
doubt. Even though they lay almost beyond his comprehension, he felt that they 3
must be true in the light of that final cosmic reality which belies all local 3
perspectives and narrow partial views; and he was familiar enough with 3
profound speculations to be free from the bondage of local and partial 3
conceptions. Had his whole quest not been based upon a faith in the unreality of 3
the local and partial? 3
3
After an impressive pause the waves continued, saying that what the denizens of 3
few-dimensioned zones call change is merely a function of their consciousness, 3
which views the external world from various cosmic angles. As the Shapes 3
produced by the cutting of a cone seem to vary with the angles of cutting - being 3
circle, ellipse, parabola or hyperbola according to that angle, yet without any 3
change in the cone itself - so do the local aspects of an unchanged - and endless 3
reality seem to change with the cosmic angle of regarding. To this variety of 3
angles Of consciousness the feeble beings of the inner worlds are slaves, since 3
with rare exceptions they can not learn to control them. Only a few students of 3
forbidden things have gained inklings of this control, and have thereby 3
conquered time and change. But the entities outside the Gates command all 3
angles, and view the myriad parts of the cosmos in terms of fragmentary change- 3
involving perspective, or of the changeless totality beyond perspective, in 3
accordance with their will. 3
3
As the waves paused again. Carter began to comprehend, vaguely and 3
terrifiedly, the ultimate background of that riddle of lost individuality which had 3
at first so horrified him. His intuition pieced together the fragments of revelation, 3
and brought him closer and closer to a grasp of the secret. He understood that 3
much of the frightful revelation would have come upon him - splitting up his ego 3
amongst myriads of earthly counterparts inside the First Gate, had not the magic 3
of 'Umr at-Tawil kept it from him in order that he might use the silver key with 3
precision for the Ultimate Gate's opening. Anxious for clearer knowledge, he 3
sent out waves of thought, asking more of the exact relationship between his 3
various facets - the fragment now beyond the Ultimate Gate, the fragment still on 3
the quasi-hexagonal pedestal beyond the First Gate, the boy of 1883, the man of 3
1928, the various ancestral beings who had formed his heritage and the bulwark 3
of his ego, amid the nameless denizens of the other eons and other worlds which 3
that first hideous flash ultimate perception had identified with him. Slowly the 3
waves of the Being surged out in reply, trying to make plain what was almost 3
beyond the reach of an earthly mind. 3
3
3
3
1196 3
3
3
3
All descended lines of beings of the finite dimensions, continued the waves, and 3
all stages of growth in each one of these beings, are merely manifestations of one 3
archetypal and eternal being in the space outside dimensions. Each local being - 3
son, father, grandfather, and so on - and each stage of individual being - infant, 3
child, boy, man - is merely one of the infinite phases of that same archetypal and 3
eternal being, caused by a variation in the angle of the consciousness-plane 3
which cuts it. Randolph Carter at all ages; Randolph Carter and all his ancestors, 3
both human and pre-human, terrestrial and pre-terrestrial; all these were only 3
phases of one ultimate, eternal "Carter" outside space and time - phantom 3
projections differentiated only by the angle at which the plane of consciousness 3
happened to cut the eternal archetype in each case. 3
3
A slight change of angle could turn the student of today into the child of 3
yesterday; could turn Randolph Carter into that wizard, Edmund Carter who 3
fled from Salem to the hills behind Arkham in 1692, or that Pickman Carter who 3
in the year 2169 would use strange means in repelling the Mongol hordes from 3
Australia; could turn a human Carter into one of those earlier entities which had 3
dwelt in primal Hyperborea and worshipped black, plastic Tsathoggua after 3
flying down from Kythamil, the double planet that once revolved around 3
Arcturus; could turn a terrestrial Carter to a remotely ancestral and doubtfully 3
shaped dweller on Kythamil itself, or a still remoter creature of trans-galactic 3
Stronti, or a four- dimensioned gaseous consciousness in an older space-time 3
continuum, or a vegetable brain of the future on a dark, radioactive comet of 3
inconceivable orbit - so on, in endless cosmic cycle. 3
3
The archetype, throbbed the waves, are the people of the Ultimate Abyss - 3
formless, ineffable, and guessed at only by rare dreamers on the low- 3
dimensioned worlds. Chief among such was this informing Being itself. . . which 3
indeed was Carter's own archetype. The gutless zeal of Carter and all his 3
forebears for forbidden cosmic secrets was a natural result of derivation from the 3
Supreme Archetype. On every world all great wizards, all great thinkers, all 3
great artists, are facets of It. 3
3
Almost stunned with awe, and with a kind of terrifying delight, Randolph 3
Carter's consciousness did homage to that transcendent Entity from which it was 3
derived. As the waves paused again he pondered in the mighty silence, thinking 3
of strange tributes, stranger questions, and still stranger requests. Curious 3
concepts flowed conflictingly through a brain dazed with unaccustomed vistas 3
and unforeseen disclosures. It occurred to him that, if these disclosures were 3
literally true, he might bodily visit all those infinitely distant ages and parts of 3
the universe which he had hitherto known only in dreams, could he but 3
command the magic to change the angle of his consciousness-plane. And did not 3
the silver key supply that magic? Had it not first changed him from a man in 3
3
3
3
1197 3
3
3
3
1928 to a boy in 1883, and then to something quite outside time? Oddly, despite 3
his present apparent absence of body; he knew that the key was still with him. 3
3
While the silence still lasted, Randolph Carter radiated forth the thoughts and 3
questions which assailed him. He knew that in this ultimate abyss he was 3
equidistant from every facet of his archetype - human or non-human, terrestrial 3
or ertra-terrestrial, galactic or tran-galactic; and his curiosity regarding the other 3
phases of his being - especially those phases which were farthest from an earthly 3
1928 in time and space, or which had most persistently haunted his dreams 3
throughout life - was at fever beat He felt that his archetypal Entity could at will 3
send him bodily to any of these phases of bygone and distant life by changing his 3
consciousness-plane and despite the marvels he had undergone he burned for 3
the further marvel of walking in the flesh through those grotesque and incredible 3
scenes which visions of the night had fragmentarily brought him. 3
3
Without definite intention be was asking the Presence for access to a dim, 3
fantastic world whose five multi-coloured suns, alien constellations, dizzily black 3
crags, clawed, tapir-snouted denizens, bizarre metal towers, unexplained 3
tunnels, and cryptical floating cylinders had intruded again and again upon his 3
slumbers. That world, he felt vaguely, was in all the conceivable cosmos the one 3
most freely in touch with others; and he longed to explore the vistas whose 3
beginnings he had glimpsed, and to embark through space to those still remoter 3
worlds with which the clawed, snouted denizens trafficked. There was no time 3
for fear. As at all crises of his strange life, sheer cosmic curiosity triumphed over 3
everything else. 3
3
When the waves resumed their awesome pulsing. Carter knew that his terrible 3
request was granted. The Being was telling him of the nighted gulfs through 3
which he would have to pass of the unknown quintuple star in an unsuspected 3
galaxy around which the alien world revolved, and of the burrowing inner 3
horrors against which the clawed, snouted race of that world perpetually fought. 3
It told him, too, of how the angle of his personal consciousness-plane, and the 3
angle of his consciousness-plane regarding the space-time elements of the 3
sought-for world, would have to be tilted simultaneously in order to restore to 3
that world the Carter-facet which had dwelt there. 3
3
The Presence wanted him to be sure of his symbols if he wished ever to return 3
from the remote and alien world he had chosen, and he radiated back an 3
impatient affirmation; confident that the silver key, which he felt was with him 3
and which he knew had tilted both world and personal planes in throwing him 3
back to 1883, contained those symbols which were meant. And now the Being, 3
grasping his impatience signified its readiness to accomplish the monstrous 3
3
3

3
3
3
precipitation. The waves abruptly ceased, and there supervened a momentary 3
stillness tense with nameless and dreadful expectancy. 3
3
Then, without warning, came a whirring and drumming that swelled to a terrific 3
thundering. Once again Carter felt himself the focal point of an intense 3
concentration of energy which smote and hammered and seared unbearably in 3
the now -familiar rhythm of outer space, and which he could not classify as either 3
the blasting heat of a blazing star, or the all-petrifying cold of the ultimate abyss. 3
Bands and rays of colour utterly foreign to any spectrum of our universe played 3
and wove and interlaced before him, and he was conscious of a frightful velocity 3
of motion. He caught one fleeting glimpse of a figure sitting alone upon a cloudy 3
throne more hexagonal than otherwise. . . 3
3
Chapter Six 3
3
As the Hindoo paused in his story he saw that de Marigny and Phillips were 3
watching him absorbedly. Aspinwall pretended to ignore the narrative and kept 3
his eyes ostentatiously on the papers before him. The alien-rhythmed ticking of 3
the coffin-shaped clock took on a new and portentous meaning, while the fumes 3
from the choked, neglected tripods wove themselves into fantastic and 3
inexplicable shapes, and formed disturbing combinations with the grotesque 3
figures of the draft-swayed tapestries. The old Negro who had tended them was 3
gone - perhaps some growing tension had frightened him out of the house. An 3
almost apologetic hesitancy hampered the speaker as he resumed in his oddly 3
labored yet idiomatic voice. 3
3
"You have found these things of the abyss hard to believe," he said, "but you 3
will find the tangible and material things ahead still barer. That is the way of our 3
minds. Marvels are doubly incredible when brought into three dimensions from 3
the vague regions of possible dream. I shall not try to tell you much - that would 3
be another and very different story. I will tell only what you absolutely have to 3
know." 3
3
Carter, after that final vortex of alien and polychromatic rhythm, had found 3
himself in what for a moment he thought was his old insistent dream. He was, as 3
many a night before, walking amidst throngs of clawed, snouted beings through 3
the streets of a labyrinth of inexplicably fashioned metal under a plate of diverse 3
solar colour; and as he looked down he saw that his body was like those of the 3
others - rugose, partly squamous, and curiously articulated in a fashion mainly 3
insect-like yet not without a caricaturish resemblance to the human outline. The 3
silver key was still in his grasp, though held by a noxious-looking claw. 3
3
3
3
1199 3
3
3
3
In another moment the dream-sense vanished, and he feh rather as one just 3
awakened from a dream. The ultimate abyss - the Being - the entity of absurd, 3
outlandish race called Randolph Carter on a world of the future not yet born - 3
some of these things were parts of the persistent recurrent dreams of the wizard 3
Zkauba on the planet Yaddith. They were too persistent - they interfered with his 3
duties in weaving spells to keep the frightful Dholes in their burrows, and 3
became mixed up with his recollections of the myriad real worlds he had visited 3
in light-beam envelopes. And now they had become quasi-real as never before. 3
This heavy, material silver key in his right upper claw, exact image of one he had 3
dreamt about meant no good. He must rest and reflect, and consult the tablets of 3
Nhing for advice on what to do. Climbing a metal wall in a lane off the main 3
concourse, he entered his apartment and approached the rack of tablets. 3
3
Seven day -fractions later Zkauba squatted on his prism in awe and half despair, 3
for the truth had opened up a new and conflicting set of memories. Nevermore 3
could he know the peace of being one entity. For all time and space he was two: 3
Zkauba the wizard of Yaddith, disgusted with the thought of the repellent earth- 3
mammal Carter that he was to be and had been, and Randolph Carter, of Boston 3
on the Earth, shivering with fright at the clawed, mantel thing which he had once 3
been, and had become again. 3
3
The time units spent on Yaddith, croaked the Swami - whose laboured voice was 3
beginning to show signs of fatigue - made a tale in themselves which could not 3
be related in brief compass. There were trips to Stronti and Mthura and Kath, 3
and other worlds in the twenty-eight galaxies accessible to the light-beam 3
envelopes of the creatures of Yaddith, and trips back and forth through eons of 3
time with the aid of the silver key and various other symbols known to Yaddith's 3
wizards. There were hideous struggles with the bleached viscous Dholes in the 3
primal tunnels that honeycombed the planet. There were awed sessions in 3
libraries amongst the massed lore of ten thousand worlds living and dead. There 3
were tense conferences with other minds of Yaddith, including that of the Arch- 3
Ancient Buo. Zkauba told no one of what had befallen his personality, but when 3
the Randolph Carter facet was uppermost he would study furiously every 3
possible means of returning to the Earth and to human form, and would 3
desperately practice human speech with the alien throat-organs so ill adapted to 3
it. 3
3
The Carter-facet had soon learned with horror that the silver key was unable to 3
effect his return to human form. It was, as he deduced too late from things he 3
remembered, things he dreamed, and things he inferred from the lore of Yaddith, 3
a product of Hyperborea on Earth; with power over the personal consciousness- 3
angles of human beings alone. It could, however, change the planetary angle and 3
send the user at will through time in an unchanged body. There had been an 3
3
3
3
1200 3
3
3
3
added spell which gave it limitless powers it otherwise lacked; but this, too, was 3
a human discovery - peculiar to a spatially unreachable region, and not to be 3
duplicated by the wizards of Yaddith. It had been written on the undecipherable 3
parchment in the hideously carven box with the silver key, and Carter bitterly 3
lamented that he had left it behind. The now inaccessible Being of the abyss had 3
warned him to be sure of his symbols, and had doubtless thought he lacked 3
nothing. 3
3
As time wore on he strove harder and harder to utilize the monstrous lore of 3
Yaddith in finding a way back to the abyss and the omnipotent Entity. With his 3
new knowledge be could have done much toward reading the cryptic 3
parchment; but that power, under present conditions, was merely ironic. There 3
were times, however, when the Zkauba-facet was uppermost and when he strove 3
to erase the conflicting Carter- memories which troubled him. 3
3
Thus long spaces of time wore on - ages longer than the brain of man could 3
grasp, since the beings of Yaddith die only after prolonged cycles. After many 3
hundreds of revolutions the Carter-facet seemed to gain on the Zkauba-facet, and 3
would spend vast periods calculating the distance of Yaddith in space and time 3
from the human Earth that was to be. The figures were staggering eons of light- 3
years beyond counting but the immemorial lore of Yaddith fitted Carter to grasp 3
such things. He cultivated the power of dreaming himself momentarily 3
Earthward, and learned many things about our planet that he had never known 3
before. But he could not dream the needed formula on the missing parchment. 3
3
Then at last he conceived a wild plan of escape from Yaddith - which began 3
when be found a drug that would keep his Zkauba-facet always dormant, yet 3
with out dissolution of the knowledge and memories of Zkauba. He thought that 3
his calculations would let him perform a voyage with a light-wave envelope such 3
as no being of Yaddidi had ever performed - a bodily voyage through nameless 3
eons and across incredible galactic reaches to the solar system and the Earth 3
itself. 3
3
Once on Earth, though in the body of a clawed, snouted thing, he might be able 3
somehow to find and finish deciphering-the strangely hieroglyphed parchment 3
he had left in the car at Arkham; and with its aid - and the key's - resume his 3
normal terrestrial semblance. 3
3
He was not blind to the perils of the attempt. He knew that when he had brought 3
the planet-angle to the right eon (a thing impossible to do while hurtling through 3
space), Yaddith would be a dead world dominated by triumphant Dholes, and 3
that his escape in the light-wave envelope would be a matter of grave doubt. 3
Likewise was he aware of how he must achieve suspended animation, in the 3
3
3
3
1201 3
3
3
3
manner of an adept, to endure the eon long flight through fathomless abysses. 3
He knew, too, that - assuming his voyage succeeded - he must immunize himself 3
to the bacterial and other earthly conditions hostile to a body from Yaddith. 3
Furthermore, he must provide a way of feigning human shape on Earth until he 3
might recover and decipher the parchment and resume that shape in truth. 3
Otherwise he would probably be discovered and destroyed by the people in 3
horror as a thing that should not be. And there must be some gold - luckily 3
obtainable on Yaddid - to tide him over that period of quest 3
3
Slowly Carter's plans went forward. He prepared a light-wave envelope of 3
abnormal toughness, able to stand both the prodigious time-transition and the 3
unexampled flight through space. He tested all his calculations, and sent forth 3
his Earthward dreams again and again, bringing them as close as possible to 3
1928. He practiced suspended animation with marvelous success. He discovered 3
just the bacterial agent he needed, and worked out the varying gravity-stress to 3
which he must become used. He artfully fashioned a waxen mask and loose 3
costume enabling him to pass among men as a human being of a sort, and 3
devised a doubly potent spell with which to hold back the Dholes at the moment 3
of his starting from the dead, black Yaddith of the inconceivable future. He took 3
care, too, to assemble a large supply of the drugs - unobtainable on Earth - which 3
would keep his Zkauba-facet in abeyance till he might shed the Yaddith body, 3
nor did he neglect a small store of gold for earthly use. 3
3
The starting-day was a time of doubt and apprehension. Carter climbed up to his 3
envelope-platform, on the pretext of sailing for the triple star Nython, and 3
crawled into the sheath of shining metal. He had just room to perform the ritual 3
of the silver key, and as he did so he slowly started the levitation of his envelope. 3
There was an appalling seething and darkening of the day, and hideous racking 3
of pain. The cosmos seemed to reel irresponsibly, and the other constellations 3
danced in a black sky. 3
3
All at once Carter felt a new equilibrium. The cold of interstellar gulfs gnawed at 3
the outside of his envelope, and he could see that he floated free in space - the 3
metal building from which he had started having decayed years before. Below 3
him the ground was festering with gigantic Dholes; and even as he looked, one 3
reared up several hundred feet and leveled a bleached, viscous end at him. But 3
his spells were effective, and in another moment he was ailing away from 3
Yaddith, unharmed. 3
3
Chapter Seven 3
3
In that bizarre room in New Orleans, from which the old black servant had 3
instinctively fled, the odd voice of Swami Chandraputta grew hoarser still. 3
3
3
3
1202 3
3
3
3
"Gentlemen," he continued, "I will not ask you to believe these things until I 3
have shown you special proof. Accept it, then, as a myth, when I tell you of the 3
thousands of light-years - thousands of years of time, and uncounted billions of 3
miles that Randolph Carter hurtled through space as a nameless, alien entity in a 3
thin envelope of electron-activated metal. He timed his period of suspended 3
animation with utmost care, planning to have it end only a few years before the 3
time of landing on the Earth in or near 1928. 3
3
"He will never forget that awakening. Remember, gentlemen, that before that 3
eon long sleep he had lived consciously for thousands of terrestrial years amidst 3
the alien and horrible wonders of Yaddith. There was a hideous gnawing of cold, 3
a cessation of menacing dreams, and a glance through the eye-plates of the 3
envelope. Stars, clusters, nebulae, on every hand - and at last their outline bore 3
some kinship to the constellations of Earth that he knew. 3
3
"Some day his descent into the solar system may be told. He saw Kynath and 3
Yuggoth on the rim, passed close to Neptune and glimpsed the hellish white 3
fungi that spot it, learned an untellable secret from the close glimpsed mists of 3
Jupiter, and saw the horror on one of the satellites, and gazed at the cyclopean 3
ruins that sprawl over Mars' ruddy disc. When the Earth drew near he saw it as a 3
thin crescent which swelled alarmingly in size. He slackened speed, though his 3
sensations of homecoming made him wish to lose not a moment. I will not try to 3
tell you of these sensations as I learned them from Carter. 3
3
"Well, toward the last Carter hovered about in the Earth's upper air waiting till 3
daylight came over the Western Hemisphere. He wanted to land where he had 3
left - near the Snake Den in the hills behind Arkham. If any of you have been 3
away from home long - and I know one of you has - I leave it to you how the 3
sight of New England's rolling hills and great elms and gnarled orchards and 3
ancient stone walls must have affected him. 3
3
"He came down at dawn in the lower meadow of the old Carter place, and was 3
thankful for the silence and solitude. It was autumn, as when he had left, and the 3
smell of the hills was balm to his soul. He managed to drag the metal envelope 3
up the slope of the timber lot into the Snake Den, though it would not go through 3
the weed-choked fissure to the inner cave. It was there also that he covered his 3
alien body with the human clothing and waxen mask which would be necessary. 3
He kept the envelope here for over a year, till certain circumstances made a new 3
hiding-place necessary. 3
3
"He walked to Arkham - incidentally practicing the management of his body in 3
human posture and against terrestrial gravity - and his gold changed to money at 3
a bank. He also made some inquiries - posing as a foreigner ignorant of much 3
3
3
3
1203 3
3
3
3
English - and found that the year was 1930, only two years after the goal he had 3
aimed at. 3
3
"Of course, his position was horrible. Unable to assert his identity, forced to live 3
on guard every moment, with certain difficulties regarding food, and with a 3
need to conserve the alien drug which kept his Zkauba- facet dormant, he felt 3
that he must act as quickly as possible. Going to Boston and taking a room in the 3
decaying West End, where he could live cheaply and inconspicuously, he at once 3
established inquiries concerning Randolph Carter's estate and effects. It was then 3
that he learned how anxious Mr. Aspinwall, here, was to have the estate divided, 3
and how valiantly Mr. de Marigny and Mr. Phillips strove to keep it intact." 3
3
The Hindoo bowed, though no expression crossed his dark, tranquil, and thickly 3
bearded face. 3
3
"Indirectly," he continued, "Carter secured a good copy of the missing 3
parchment and began working on its deciphering. I am glad to say that I was 3
able to help in all this - for he appealed to me quite early, and through me came 3
in touch with other mystics throughout the world. I went to live with him in 3
Boston - a wretched place in Chambers Street. As for the parchment - I am 3
pleased to help Mr. de Marigny in his perplexity. To him let me say that the 3
language of those hieroglyphics is not Naacal, but R'lyehian, which was brought 3
to Earth by the spawn of Cthulhu countless ages ago. It is, of coarse, a translation 3
- there was an Hyperborean original millions of years earlier in the primal 3
tongue of Tsath-yo. 3
3
"There was more to decipher than Carter had looked for, but at no time did he 3
give up hope. Early this year he made great strides through a book he imported 3
from Nepal, and there is no question but that he will win before long. 3
Unfortunately, however, one handicap has developed - the exhaustion of the 3
alien drug which keeps the Zkauba-facet dormant. This is not, however, as great 3
a calamity as was feared. Carter's personality is gaining in the body, and when 3
Zkauba comes upper most - for shorter and shorter periods, and now only when 3
evoked by some unusual excitement - he is generally too dazed to undo any of 3
Carter's work. He can not find the metal envelope that would take him hack to 3
Yaddith, for although he almost did, once. Carter hid it anew at a time when the 3
Zkanba-facet was wholly latent. All the harm he has done is to frighten a few 3
people and create certain nightmare rumors among the Poles and Lithuanians of 3
Boston's West End. So far, he had never injured the careful disguise prepared by 3
the Carter-facet, though he sometimes throws it off so that parts have to be 3
replaced. I have seen what lies beneath - and it is not good to see. 3
3
3
3
1204 3
3
3
3
"A month ago Carter saw the advertisement of this meeting, and knew that he 3
must act quickly to save his estate. He could not wait to decipher the parchment 3
and resume his human form. Consequently he deputed me to act for him. 3
3
"Gentlemen, I say to you that Randolph Carter is not dead; that he is temporarily 3
in an anomalous condition, but that within two or three months at the outside he 3
will be able to appear in proper form and demand the custody of his estate. I am 3
prepared to offer proof if necessary. Therefore I beg that you will adjourn this 3
meeting for an indefinite period." 3
3
Chapter Eight 3
3
De Marigny and Phillips stared at the Hindoo as if hypnotized, while Aspinwall 3
emitted a series of snorts and bellows. The old attorney's disgust had by now 3
surged into open rage and he pounded the table with an apoplectically veined fit 3
When he spoke, it was in a kind of bark. 3
3
"How long is this foolery to be borne? I've listened an hour to this madman - this 3
faker - and now he has the damned effrontery to say Randolph Carter is alive - to 3
ask us to postpone the settlement for no good reason! Why don't you throw the 3
scoundrel out, de Marigny? Do you mean to make us all the butts of a charlatan 3
or idiot?" 3
3
De Marigny quietly raised his hand and spoke softly. 3
3
"Let us think slowly and dearly. This has been a very singular tale, and there are 3
things in it which I, as a mystic not altogether ignorant, recognize as far from 3
impossible. Furthermore - since 1930 I have received letters from the Swami 3
which tally with his account." 3
3
As he paused, old Mr. Phillips ventured a word. 3
3
"Swami Chandraputra spoke of proofs. I, too, recognize much that is significant 3
in this story, and I have myself had many oddly corroborative letters from the 3
Swami during the last two years; but some of these statements are very extreme. 3
Is there not something tangible which can be shown?" 3
3
At last the impassive-faced Swami replied, slowly and hoarsely, and drawing an 3
object from the pocket of his loose coat as he spoke. 3
3
"While none of you here has ever seen the silver key itself, Messrs. de Marigny 3
and Phillips have seen photographs of it. Does this look familiar to you?" 3
3
3
3
1205 3
3
3
3
He fumblingly laid on the table, with his large, white-mittened hand, a heavy 3
key of tarnished silver - nearly five inches long, of unknown and utterly exotic 3
workmanship, and covered from end to end with hieroglyphs of the most bizarre 3
description. De Marigny and Phillips gasped. 3
3
"That's it!" cried de Marigny. "The camera doesn't lie I couldn't be mistaken!" 3
3
But Aspinwall had already launched a reply. 3
3
"Fools! What does it prove? If that's really the key that belonged to my cousin, 3
it's up to this foreigner - this damned nigger - to explain how he got it! Randolph 3
Carter vanished with the key four years ago. How do we know he wasn't robbed 3
and murdered? He was half crazy himself, and in touch with still crazier people. 3
3
"Look here, you nigger - where did you get that key? Did you kill Randolph 3
Carter?" 3
3
The Swami's features, abnormally placid, did not change; but the remote, irisless 3
black eyes behind them blazed dangerously. He spoke with great difficulty. 3
3
"Please control yourself, Mr. Aspinwall. There is another form of poof that I 3
could give, but its effect upon everybody would not be pleasant. Let us be 3
reasonable. Here are some papers obviously written since 1930, and in the 3
unmistakable style of Randolph Carter." 3
3
He clumsily drew a long envelope from inside his loose coat and handed it to the 3
sputtering attorney as de Marigny and Phillips watched with chaotic thoughts 3
and a dawning feeling of supernal wonder. 3
3
"Of course the handwriting is almost illegible - but remember that Randolph 3
Carter now has no hands well adapted to forming human script." 3
3
Aspinwall looked through the papers hurriedly, and was visibly perplexed, but 3
he did not change his demeanor. The room was tense with excitement and 3
nameless dread and the alien rhythm of the coffin- shaped clock had an utterly 3
diabolic sound to de Marigny and Phillips, though the lawyer seemed affected 3
not at all. 3
3
Aspinwall spoke again. "These look like clever forgeries. If they aren't, they may 3
mean that Randolph Carter has been brought under the control of people with no 3
good purpose. There's only one thing to do - have this faker arrested. De 3
Marigny, will you telephone for the police?" 3
3
3
3
1206 3
3
3
3
"Let us wait/' answered their host. "I do not think this case calls for the police. I 3
have a certain idea. Mr. Aspinwall, this gentleman is a mystic of real attainments. 3
He says he is in the confidence of Randolph Carter. Will it satisfy you if he can 3
answer certain questions which could be answered only by one in such 3
confidence? I know Carter, and can ask such questions. Let me get a book which 3
I think will make a good test." 3
3
He turned toward the door to the library, Phillips dazedly following in a kind of 3
automatic way. Aspinwall remained where he was, studying closely the Hindoo 3
who confronted him with abnormally impassive face. Suddenly, as 3
Chandraputra clumsily restored the silver key to his pocket the lawyer emitted a 3
guttural shout. 3
3
"Hey, by Heaven I've got it! This rascal is in disguise. I don't believe he's an East 3
Indian at all. That face - it isn't a face, but a mask! I guess his story put that into 3
my head, but it's true. It never moves, and that turban and beard hide the edges. 3
This fellow's a common crook! He isn't even a foreigner - I've been watching his 3
language. He's a Yankee of some sort. And look at those mittens - he knows his 3
fingerprints could be spotted. Damn you, I'll pull that thing off -" 3
3
"Stop!" The hoarse, oddly alien voice of the Swami held a tone beyond all mere 3
earthly fright "I told you there was another form of proof which I could give if 3
necessary, and I warned you not to provoke me to it. This red-faced old meddler 3
is right; I'm not really an East Indian. This face is a mask, and what it covers is 3
not human. You others have guessed - I felt that minutes ago. It wouldn't be 3
pleasant if I took that mask off - let it alone. Ernest, I may as well tell you that I 3
am Randolph Carter." 3
3
No one moved. Aspinwall snorted and made vague motions. De Marigny and 3
Phillips, across the room, watched the workings of the red face and studied the 3
back of the turbaned figure that confronted him. The clock's abnormal ticking 3
was hideous and the tripod fumes and swaying arras danced a dance of death. 3
The half-choking lawyer broke the silence. 3
3
"No you don't, you crook - you can't scare me! You've reasons of your own for 3
not wanting that mask off. Maybe we'd know who you are. Off with it - " 3
3
As he reached forward, the Swami seized his hand with one of his own clumsily 3
mittened members, evoking a curious cry of mixed pain and surprise. De 3
Marigny started toward the two, but paused confused as the pseudo-Hindoo's 3
shout of protest changed to a wholly inexplicable rattling and buzzing sound. 3
Aspinwall's red face was furious, and with his free hand he made another lunge 3
at his opponent's bushy beard. This time he succeeded in getting a hold, and at 3
3
3
3
1207 3
3
3
3
his frantic tug the whole waxen visage came loose from the turban and clung to 3
the lawyer's apoplectic fist. 3
3
As it did so, Aspinwall uttered a frightful gurgling cry, and Phillips and de 3
Maigny saw his face convulsed with a wilder, deep and more hideous epilepsy 3
of stark panic than ever they had seen on human countenance before. The 3
pseudo-Swami had meanwhile released his other hand and was standing as if 3
dazed, making buzzing noises of a most abnormal quality. Then the turbaned 3
figure slumped oddly into a posture scarcely human, and began a curious, 3
fascinated sort of shuffle toward the coffin-shaped clock that ticked out its 3
cosmic and abnormal rhythm. His now uncovered face was turned away, and de 3
Marigny and Phillips could not see what the lawyer's act had disclosure. Then 3
their attention was turned to Aspinwall, who was sinking ponderously to the 3
floor. The spell was broken-but when they reached the old man he was dead. 3
3
Turning quickly to the shuffling Swami's receding back, de Marigny saw one of 3
the great white mittens drop listlessly off a dangling arm. The fumes of the 3
olibanum were thick, and all that could be glimpsed of the revealed hand was 3
something long and black... Before the Creole could reach the retreating figure, 3
old Mr. Phillips laid a hand on his shoulder. 3
3
"Don't!" he whispered, "We don't know what we're up against. That other facet, 3
you know - Zkauba, the wizard of Yaddith. . . " 3
3
The turbaned figure had now reached the abnormal clock, and the watchers saw 3
though the dense fumes a blurred black claw fumbling with the tall, 3
hieroglyphed door. The fumbling made a queer, clicking sound. Then the figure 3
entered the coffin-shaped case and pulled the door shut after it. 3
3
De Marigny could no longer be restrained, but when he reached and opened the 3
clock it was empty. The abnormal ticking went on, beating out the dark, cosmic 3
rhythm which underlies all mystical gate- openings. On the floor the great white 3
mitten, and the dead man with a bearded mask clutched in his hand, had 3
nothing further to reveal. 3
3
3
3
A year passed, and nothing has been heard of Randolph Carter. His estate is still 3
unsettled. The Boston address from which one "Swami Chandraputra" sent 3
inquiries to various mystics in 1930-31-32 was indeed tenanted by a strange 3
Hindoo, but he left shortly before the date of the New Orleans conference and 3
has never been seen since. He was said to be dark, expressionless, and bearded, 3
and his landlord thinks the swarthy mask - which was duly exhibited - looked 3
3
3
3
1208 3
3
3
3
very much like him. He was never, however, suspected of any connection with 3
the nightmare apparitions whispered of by local Slavs. The hills behind Arkham 3
were searched for the "metal envelope," but nothing of the sort was ever found. 3
However, a clerk in Arkham's First National Bank does recall a queer turbaned 3
man who cashed an odd bit of gold bullion in October, 1930. 3
3
De Marigny and Phillips scarcely know what to make of the business. After all, 3
what was proved? 3
3
There was a story. There was a key which might have been forged from one of 3
the pictures Carter had freely distributed in 1928. There were papers - all 3
indecisive. There was a masked stranger, but who now living saw behind the 3
mask? Amidst the strain and the olibanum fumes that act of vanishing in the 3
clock might easily have been a dual hallucination. Hindoos know much of 3
hypnotism. Reason proclaims the "Swami" a criminal with designs on Randolph 3
Carter's estate. But the autopsy said that Aspinwall had died of shock. Was it 3
rage alone which caused it? And some things in that story. . . 3

In a vast room hung with strangely figured arras and filled with olibanum 3
fumes, Etienne Laurent de Marigny often sits listening with vague sensations to 3
the abnormal rhythm of that hieroglyphed, coffin- shaped clock. 3

Upon an eroded cliff-top rested the man, gazing far across the valley. Lying thus, 3
he could see a great distance, but in all the sere expanse there was no visible 3
motion. Nothing stirred the dusty plain, the disintegrated sand of long-dry river- 3
beds, where once coursed the gushing streams of Earth's youth. There was little 3
greenery in this ultimate world, this final stage of mankind's prolonged presence 3
upon the planet. For unnumbered aeons the drought and sandstorms had 3
ravaged all the lands. The trees and bushes had given way to small, twisted 3
shrubs that persisted long through their sturdiness; but these, in turn, perished 3
before the onslaught of coarse grasses and stringy, tough vegetation of strange 3
evolution. 3
3
The ever-present heat, as Earth drew nearer to the sun, withered and killed with 3
pitiless rays. It had not come at once; long aeons had gone before any could feel 3
the change. And all through those first ages man's adaptable form had followed 3
the slow mutation and modelled itself to fit the more and more torrid air. then 3
the day had come when men could bear their hot cities but ill, and a gradual 3
recession began, slow yet deliberate. Those towns and settlements closest to the 3
equator had been first, of course, but later there were others. Man, softened and 3
exhausted, could cope no longer with the ruthlessly mounting heat. It seared him 3
as he was, and evolution was too slow to mould new resistances in him. 3
3
Yet not at first were the great cities of the equator left to the spider and the 3
scorpion. In the early years there were many who stayed on, devising curious 3
shields and armours against the heat and the deadly dryness. These fearless 3
souls, screening certain buildings against the encroaching sun, made miniature 3
worlds of marvellously ingenious things, so that for a while men persisted in the 3
rusting towers, hoping thereby to cling to old lands till the searing should be 3
over. For many would not believe what the astronomers said, and looked for a 3
coming of the mild olden world again. But one day the men of Dath, from the 3
new city of Niyara, made signals to Yuanario, their immemorially ancient capital, 3
and gained no answer from the few who remained therein. And when explorers 3
reached that millennial city of bridge- linked towers they found only silence. 3
There was not even the horror of corruption, for the scavenger lizards had been 3
swift. 3
3
3
3
1210 3
3
3
3
Only then did the people fully realize that these cities were lost to them; know 3
that they must forever abandon them to nature. The other colonists in the hot 3
lands fled from their brave posts, and total silence reigned within the high basalt 3
walls of a thousand empty towns. Of the denser throngs and multitudinous 3
activities of the past, nothing finally remained. There now loomed against the 3
rainless deserts only the blistered towers of vacant houses, factories, and 3
structures of every sort, reflecting the sun's dazzling radiance and parching in 3
the more and more intolerable heat. 3
3
Many lands, however, had still escaped the scorching blight, so that the refugees 3
were soon absorbed in the life of a newer world. During strangely prosperous 3
centuries the hoary deserted cities of the equator grew half-forgotten and 3
entwined with fantastic fables. Few thought of those spectral, rotting 3
towers... those huddles of shabby walls and cactus-choked streets, darkly silent 3
and abandoned. . . 3
3
Wars came, sinful and prolonged, but the times of peace were greater. Yet always 3
the swollen sun increased its radiance as Earth drew closer to its fiery parent. It 3
was as if the planet meant to return to that source whence it was snatched, aeons 3
ago, through the accidents of cosmic growth. 3
3
After a time the blight crept outward from the central belt. Southern Yarat 3
burned as a tenantless desert - and then the north. In Perath and Baling, those 3
ancient cities where brooding centuries dwelt, there moved only the scaly shapes 3
of the serpent and the salamander, and at last Loron echoed only to the fitful 3
falling of tottering spires and crumbling domes. 3
3
Steady, universal, and inexorable was the great eviction of man from the realms 3
he had always known. No land within the widening stricken belt was spared; no 3
people left unrouted. It was an epic, a titan tragedy whose plot was unrevealed 3
to the actors - this wholesale desertion of the cities of men. It took not years or 3
even centuries, but millennia of ruthless change. And still it kept on - sullen, 3
inevitable, savagely devastating. 3
3
Agriculture was at a standstill, the world fast became too arid for crops. This was 3
remedied by artificial substitutes, soon universally used. And as the old places 3
that had known the great things of mortals were left, the loot salvaged by the 3
fugitives grew smaller and smaller. Things of the greatest value and importance 3
were left in dead museums - lost amid the centuries - and in the end the heritage 3
of the immemorial past was abandoned. A degeneracy both physical and cultural 3
set in with the insidious heat. For man had so long dwelt in comfort and security 3
that this exodus from past scenes was difficult. Nor were these events received 3
phlegmatically; their very slowness was terrifying. Degradation and debauchery 3
3
3
3
1211 3
3
3
3
were soon common; government was disorganized, and the civilization aimlessly 3
slid back toward barbarism. 3
3
When, forty-nine centuries after the blight from the equatorial belt, the whole 3
western hemisphere was left unpeopled, chaos was complete. There was no trace 3
of order or decency in the last scenes of this titanic, wildly impressive migration. 3
Madness and frenzy stalked through them, and fanatics screamed of an 3
Armageddon close at hand. 3
3
Mankind was now a pitiful remnant of the elder races, a fugitive not only from 3
the prevailing conditions, but from his own degeneracy. Into the northland and 3
the antarctic went those who could; the rest lingered for years in an incredible 3
saturnalia, vaguely doubting the forthcoming disasters. In the city of Borligo a 3
wholesale execution of the new prophets took place, after months of unfulfilled 3
expectations. They thought the flight to the northland unnecessary, and no 3
longer looked for the threatened ending. 3
3
How they perished must have been terrible indeed - those vain, foolish creatures 3
who thought to defy the universe. But the blackened, scorched towers are 3
mute... 3
3
These events, however, must not be chronicled - for there are larger things to 3
consider then this complex and unhastening downfall of a lost civilization. 3
During a long period morale was at lowest ebb among the courageous few who 3
settled upon the alien arctic and antarctic shores, now mild as were those of 3
southern Yarat in the long-dead past. But here there was respite. The soil was 3
fertile, and forgotten pastoral arts were called into use anew. There was, for a 3
long time, a contented little epitome of the lost lands; though here were no vast 3
throngs or great buildings. Only a sparse remnant of humanity survived the 3
aeons of change and peopled those scattered villages of the later world. 3
3
How many millenia this continued is not known. The sun was slow in invading 3
this last retreat; and as the eras passed there developed a sound, sturdy race, 3
bearing no memories or legends of the old, lost lands. Little navigation was 3
practiced by this new people, and the flying machine was wholly forgotten. Their 3
devices were of the simplest type, and their culture was simple and primitive. 3
Yet they were contented, and accepted the warm climate as something natural 3
and accustomed. 3
3
But unknown to these simple peasant-folk, still further rigours of nature were 3
slowly preparing themselves. As the generations passed, the waters of the vast 3
and unplumbed ocean wasted slowly away; enriching the air and the desiccated 3
soil, but sinking lower and lower each century. The splashing surf still glistened 3
3
3
3
1212 3
3
3
3
bright, and the swirhng eddies were still there, but a doom of dryness hung over 3
the whole watery expanse. However, the shrinkage could not have been detected 3
save by instruments more delicate than any then known to the race. Even had the 3
people realized the ocean's contraction, it is not likely that any vast alarm or 3
great disturbace would have resulted, for the losses were so slight, and the sea so 3
great... Only a few inches during many centuries - but in many centuries; 3
increasing - 3
3
3
3
So at last the oceans went, and water became a rarity on a globe of sun-baked 3
drought. Man had slowly spread over all the arctic and antarctic lands; the 3
equatorial cities, and many of later habitation, were forgotten even to legend. 3
3
And now again the peace was disturbed, for water was scarce, and found only in 3
deep caverns. There was little enough, even of this; and men died of thirst 3
wandering in far places. Yet so slow were those deadly changes, that each new 3
generation of man was loath to believe what it heard from its parents. None 3
would admit that the heat had been less or the water more plentiful in the old 3
days, or take warning that days of bitterer burning and drought were to come. 3
Thus it was even at the end, when only a few hundred human creatures panted 3
for breath beneath the cruel sun; a piteous huddled handful out of all the 3
unnumbered millions who had once dwelt on the doomed planet. 3
3
And the hundreds became small, till man was to be reckoned only in tens. These 3
tens clung to the shrinking dampness of the caves, and knew at last at the end 3
was near. So slight was their range that none had ever seen the tiny, fabled spots 3
of ice left close to the parent's poles - if indeed such remained. Even had they 3
existed and been known to man, none could have reached them across the 3
trackless and formidable deserts. And so the last pathetic few dwindled... 3
3
It cannot be described, this awesome chain of events that depopulated the whole 3
Earth; the range is too tremendous for any to picture or encompass. Of the 3
people of Earth's fortunate ages, billions of years before, only a few prophets and 3
madmen could have conceived that which was to come - could have grasped 3
visions of the still, dead lands, and long-empty sea-beds. The rest would have 3
doubted... doubted alike the shadow of change upon the planet and the shadow 3
of doom upon the race. For man has always thought himself the immortal master 3
of natural things. . . 3

When he had eased the dying pangs of the old woman, Ull wandered in a fearful 3
daze out into the dazzling sands. She had been a fearsome thing, shrivelled and 3
so dry; like withered leaves. Her face had been the colour of the sickly yellow 3
grasses that rustled in the hot wind, and she was loathsomely old. 3
3
But she had been a companion; someone to stammer out vague fears to, to talk to 3
about this incredible thing; a comrade to share one's hopes for succour from 3
those silent other colonies beyond the mountains. He could not believe none 3
lived elsewhere, for Ull was young, and not certain as are the old. 3
3
For many years he had known none but the old woman - her name was 3
Mladdna. She had come that day in his eleventh year, when all the hunters went 3
to seek food, and did not return. Ull had no mother that he could remember, and 3
there were few women in the tiny group. When the men had vanished, those 3
three women, the young one and the two old, had screamed fearfully, and 3
moaned long. Then the young one had gone mad, and killed herself with a sharp 3
stick. The old ones buried her in a shallow hole dug with their nails, so Ull had 3
been alone when this still older Mladdna came. 3
3
She walked with the aid of a knotty pole, a priceless relique of the old forests, 3
hard and shiny with years of use. She did not say whence she came, but 3
stumbled into the cabin while the young suicide was being buried. There she 3
waited till the two returned, and they accepted her incuriously. 3
3
That was the way it had been for many weeks, until the two fell sick, and 3
Mladdna could not cure them, strange that those younger two should have been 3
stricken, while she, infirm and ancient, lived on. Mladdna had cared for them 3
many days, and at length they died, so that Ull was left with only the stranger. 3
He screamed all the night, so she became at length out of patience, and 3
threatened to die too. Then, hearkening, he became quiet at once; for he was not 3
desirous of complete solitude. After that he lived with Mladdna and they 3
gathered roots to eat. 3
3
Mladdna's rotten teeth were ill suited to the food they gathered, but they 3
continued to chop it up till she could manage it. This weary routine of seeking 3
and eating was Ull's childhood. 3
3
Now he was strong, and firm, in his nineteenth year, and the old woman was 3
dead. There was naught to stay for, so he determined at once to seek out those 3
fabled huts beyond the mountains, and live with the people there. There was 3
nothing to take on the journey. Ull closed the door of his cabin - why, he could 3
not have told, for no animals had been there for many years - and left the dead 3
woman within. Half- dazed, and fearful at his own audacity, he walked long 3
3
3
3
1214 3
3
3
3
hours in the dry grasses, and at length reached the first of the foothills. The 3
afternoon came, and he climbed until he was weary, and lay down on the 3
grasses. Sprawled there, he thought of many things. He wondered at the strange 3
life, passionately anxious to seek out the lost colony beyond the mountains; but 3
at last he slept. 3
3
When he awoke there was starlight on his face, and he felt refreshed. Now that 3
the sun was gone for a time, he travelled more quickly, eating little, and 3
determining to hasten before the lack of water became difficult to bear. He had 3
brought none; for the last people, dwelling in one place and never having 3
occasion to bear their precious water away, made no vessels of any kind. UU 3
hoped to reach his goal within a day, and thus escape thirst; so he hurried on 3
beneath the bright stars, running at times in the warm air, and at other times 3
lapsing into a dogtrot. 3
3
So he continued until the sun arose, yet still he was within the small hills, with 3
three great peaks looming ahead. In their shade he rested again, then he climbed 3
all the morning, and at mid-day surmounted the first peak, where he lay for a 3
time, surveying the space before the next range. 3
3
Upon an eroded cliff-top rested the man, gazing far across the valley. Lying thus 3
he could see a great distance, but in all the sere expanse there was no visible 3
motion. . . 3
3
The second night came, and found UU amid the rough peaks, the valley and the 3
place where he had rested far behind. He was nearly out of the second range 3
now, and hurrying still. Thirst had come upon him that day, and he regretted his 3
folly. Yet he could not have stayed there with the corpse, alone in the grasslands. 3
He sought to convince himself thus, and hastened ever on, tiredly straining. 3
3
And now there only a few steps before the cliff wall would part and allow a view 3
of the land beyond. UU stumbled wearily down the stony way, tumbling and 3
bruising himself even more. It was nearly before him, this land of which he had 3
heard tales in his youth. The way was long, but the goal was great. A boulder of 3
giant circumference cut off his view; upon this he scrambled anxiously. Now at 3
last he could behold by the sinking orb his long-sought destination, and his thirst 3
and aching muscles were forgotten as he saw joyfully that a small huddle of 3
buildings clung to the base of the farther cliff. 3
3
UU rested not; but, spurred on by what he saw, ran and staggered and crawled 3
the half mile remaining. He fancied that he could detect forms among the rude 3
cabins. The sun was nearly gone; the hateful, devastating sun that had slain 3
humanity. He could not be sure of details, but soon the cabins were near. 3
3
3
3
1215 3
3
3
3
They were very old, for clay blocks lasted long in the still dryness of the dying 3
world. Little, indeed, changed but the living things - the grasses and these last 3
men. 3
3
Before him an open door swung upon rude pegs. In the fading ligh Ull entered, 3
weary unto death, seeking painfully the expected faces. 3
3
Then he fell upon the floor and wept, for at the table was propped a dry and 3
ancient skeleton. 3
3
3
3
He rose at last, crazed by thirst, aching unbearably, and suffering the greatest 3
disappointment nay mortal could know. He was, then, the last living thing upon 3
the globe. His the heritage of the Earth... all the lands, and all to him equally 3
useless. He staggered upo, not looking at the dim white form in the reflected 3
moonlight, and went through the door. About the empty village he wandered, 3
searching for water and sadly inspecting this long-empty place so spectrally 3
preserved by the changeless air. here there was a dwelling, there a rude place 3
where things had been made - clay vessels holding only dust, and nowhere any 3
liquid to quench his burning thirst. 3
3
Then, in the centre of the little town, Ull saw a well-curb. He knew what it was, 3
for he had heard tales of such thing from Mladdna. With pitiful joy, he reeled 3
forward and leaned upon the edge. There, at last, was the end of his search. 3
Water - slimy, stagnant, and shallow, but water - before his sight. 3
3
Ull cried out in the voice of a tortured animal, groping for the chain and bucket. 3
His hand slipped on the slimy edge; and he fell upon his chest across the brink. 3
For a moment he lay there - then soundlessly his body was precipitated down 3
the black shaft. 3
3
There was a slight splash in the murky shallowness as he struck some long- 3
sunken stone, dislodged aeons ago from the massive coping. The disturbed 3
water subsided into quietness. 3
3
And now at last the Earth was dead. The final, pitiful survivor had perished. All 3
the teeming billions; the slow aeons; the empires and civilizations of mankind 3
were summed up in this poor twisted form - and how titanically meaningless it 3
all had been! Now indeed had come an end and climax to all the efforts of 3
humanity - how monstrous and incredible a climax in the eyes of those poor 3
complacent fools of the prosperous days! Not ever again would the planet know 3
the thunderous rampaging of human millions - or even the crawling of lizards 3
3
3
3
1216 3
3
3
3
and the buzz of insects, for they, too, had gone, now was come the reign of 3
sapless branches and endless fields of tough grasses. Earth, like its cold, 3
imperturbable moon, was given over to silence and blackness forever. 3
3
The stars whirred on; the whole careless plan would continue for infinities 3
unknown. This trivial end of a negligible episode mattered not to distant nebulae 3
or to suns new-born, flourishing, and dying. The race of man, too puny and 3
momentary to have a real function or purpose, was as if it had never existed. To 3
such a conclusion the aeons of its farcically toilsome evolution had led. 3
3
But when the deadly sun's first rays darted across the valley, a light found its 3
way to the weary face of a broken figure that lay in the slime. 3

Two Black Bottles - with Wilfred 3
Blanch Talman 3
3
Not all of the few remaining inhabitants of Daalbergen, that dismal little village 3
in the Ramapo Mountains, believe that my uncle, old Dominie Vanderhoof, is 3
really dead. Some of them believe he is suspended somewhere between heaven 3
and hell because of the old sexton's curse. If it had not been for that old magician, 3
he might still be preaching in the little damp church across the moor. 3
3
After what has happened to me in Daalbergen, I can almost share the opinion of 3
the villagers. I am not sure that my uncle is dead, but I am very sure that he is 3
not alive upon this earth. There is no doubt that the old sexton buried him once, 3
but he is not in that grave now. I can almost feel him behind me as I write, 3
impelling me to tell the truth about those strange happenings in Daalbergen so 3
many years ago. 3
3
It was the fourth day of October when I arrived at Daalbergen in answer to a 3
summons. The letter was from a former member of my uncle's congregation, 3
who wrote that the old man had passed away and that there should be some 3
small estate which I, as his only living relative, might inherit. Having reached the 3
secluded little hamlet by a wearying series of changes on branch railways, I 3
found my way to the grocery store of Mark Haines, writer of the letter, and he, 3
leading me into a stuffy back room, told me a peculiar tale concerning Dominie 3
Vanderhoof's death. 3
3
"Y' should be careful, Hoffman," Haines told me, "when y' meet that old sexton, 3
Abel Foster. He's in league with the devil, sure's you're alive 'Twa'n't two weeks 3
ago Sam Pryor, when he passed the old graveyard, beared him mumblin' t' the 3
dead there. 'Twa'n't right be should talk that way - an' Sam does vow that there 3
was a voice answered him - a kind o' half-voice, hollow and muffled-like, as 3
though it come out o' th' ground. There's others, too, as could tell y' about seein' 3
him standin' afore old Dominie Slott's grave - that one right agin' the church wall 3
- a-wringin' his hands an' a-talkin' t' th' moss on th' tombstone as though it was 3
the old Dominie himself." 3
3
Old Foster, Haines said, had come to Daalbergen about ten years before, and had 3
been immediately engaged by Vanderhoof to take care of the damp stone church 3
at which most of the villagers worshipped. No one but Vanderhoof seemed to 3
like him, for his presence brought a suggestion almost of the uncanny. He would 3
sometimes stand by the door when the people came to church, and the men 3
would coldly return his servile bow while the women brushed past in haste. 3
3
3
3
1218 3

3
3
holding their skirts aside to avoid touching him. He could be seen on week days 3
cutting the grass in the cemetery and tending the flowers around the graves, now 3
and then crooning and muttering to himself. And few failed to notice the 3
particular attention he paid to the grave of the Reverend Guilliam Slott, first 3
pastor of the church in 1701. 3
3
It was not long after Foster's establishment as a village fixture that disaster began 3
to lower. First came the failure of the mountain mine where most of the men 3
worked. The vein of iron had given out, and many of the people moved away to 3
better localities, while those who had large holdings of land in the vicinity took 3
to farming and managed to wrest a meager living from the rocky hillsides. Then 3
came the disturbances in the church. It was whispered about that the Reverend 3
Johannes Vanderhoof had made a compact with the devil, and was preaching his 3
word in the house of God. His sermons had become weird and grotesque - 3
redolent with sinister things which the ignorant people of Daalbergen did not 3
understand. He transported them back over ages of fear and superstition to 3
regions of hideous, unseen spirits, and peopled their fancy with night-haunting 3
ghouls. One by one the congregation dwindled, while the elders and deacons 3
vainly pleaded with Vanderhoof to change the subject of his sermons. Though 3
the old man continually promised to comply, he seemed to be enthralled by 3
some higher power which forced him to do its will. 3
3
A giant in stature, Johannes Vanderhoof was known to be weak and timid at 3
heart, yet even when threatened with expulsion he continued his eerie sermons, 3
until scarcely a handful of people remained to listen to him on Sunday morning. 3
Because of weak finances, it was found impossible to call a new pastor, and 3
before long not one of the villagers dared venture near the church or the 3
parsonage which adjoined it. Everywhere there was fear of those spectral wraiths 3
with whom Vanderhoof was apparently in league. 3
3
My uncle, Mark Haines told me, had continued to live in the parsonage because 3
there was no one with sufficient courage to tell him to move out of it. No one 3
ever saw him again, but lights were visible in the parsonage at night, and were 3
even glimpsed in the church from time to time. It was whispered about the town 3
that Vanderhoof preached regularly in the church every Sunday morning, 3
unaware that his congregation was no longer there to listen. He had only the old 3
sexton, who lived in the basement of the church, to take care of him, and Foster 3
made a weekly visit to what remained of the business section of the village to 3
buy provisions. He no longer bowed servilely to everyone he met, but instead 3
seemed to harbor a demoniac and ill-concealed hatred. He spoke to no one 3
except as was necessary to make his purchases, and glanced from left to right out 3
of evil-filled eyes as he walked the street with his cane tapping the uneven 3
pavements. Bent and shriveled with extreme age, his presence could actually be 3
3
3
3
1219 3
3
3
3
felt by anyone near him, so powerful was that personality which, said the 3
townspeople, had made Vanderhoof accept the devil as his master. No person in 3
Daalbergen doubted that Abel Foster was at the bottom of all the town's ill luck, 3
but not a one dared lift a finger against him, or could even approach him without 3
a tremor of fear. His name, as well as Vanderhoof s, was never mentioned aloud. 3
Whenever the matter of the church across the moor was discussed, it was in 3
whispers; and if the conversation chanced to be nocturnal, the whisperers would 3
keep glancing over their shoulders to make sure that nothing shapeless or 3
sinister crept out of the darkness to bear witness to their words. 3
3
The churchyard continued to be kept just as green and beautiful as when the 3
church was in use, and the flowers near the graves in the cemetery were tended 3
just as carefully as in times gone by. The old sexton could occasionally be seen 3
working there, as if still being paid for his services, and those who dared venture 3
near said that he maintained a continual conversation with the devil and with 3
those spirits which lurked within the graveyard walls. 3
3
One morning, Haines went on to say, Foster was seen digging a grave where the 3
steeple of the church throws its shadow in the afternoon, before the sun goes 3
down behind the mountain and puts the entire village in semi-twilight. Later, the 3
church bell, silent for months, tolled solemnly for a half-hour. And at sun-down 3
those who were watching from a distance saw Foster bring a coffin from the 3
parsonage on a wheelbarrow, dump it into the grave with slender ceremony, and 3
replace the earth in the hole. 3
3
The sexton came to the village the next morning, ahead of his usual weekly 3
schedule, and in much better spirits than was customary. He seemed willing to 3
talk, remarking that Vanderhoof had died the day before, and that he had buried 3
his body beside that of Dominie Slott near the church wall. He smiled from time 3
to time, and rubbed his hands in an untimely and unaccountable glee. It was 3
apparent that he took a perverse and diabolic delight in Vanderhoof's death. The 3
villagers were conscious of an added uncanniness in his presence, and avoided 3
him as much as they could. With Vanderhoof gone they felt more insecure than 3
ever, for the old sexton was now free to cast his worst spells over the town from 3
the church across the moor. Muttering something in a tongue which no one 3
understood, Foster made his way back along the road over the swamp. 3
3
It was then that Mark Haines remembered having heard Dominie Vanderhoof 3
speak of me as his nephew. Haines accordingly sent for me, in the hope that I 3
might know something which would clear up the mystery of my uncle's last 3
years. I assured my summoner, however, that I knew nothing about my uncle or 3
his past, except that my mother had mentioned him as a man of gigantic 3
physique but with little courage or power of will. 3

Having heard all that Haines had to tell me, I lowered the front legs of my chair 3
to the floor and looked at my watch. It was late afternoon. 3
3
"How far is it out to the church?" I inquired. "Think I can make it before sunset?" 3
3
"Sure, lad, y' ain't goin' out there t' night! Not t' that place!" The old man 3
trembled noticeably in every limb and half rose from his chair, stretching out a 3
lean, detaining hand, "Why, it's plumb foolishness!" he exclaimed. 3
3
I laughed aside his fears and informed him that, come what may, I was 3
determined to see the old sexton that evening and get the whole matter over as 3
soon as possible. I did not intend to accept the superstitions of ignorant country 3
folk as truth, for I was convinced that all I had just heard was merely a chain of 3
events which the over-imaginative people of Daalbergen had happened to link 3
with their ill-luck. I felt no sense of fear or horror whatever. 3
3
Seeing that I was determined to reach my uncle's house before nightfall, Haines 3
ushered me out of his office and reluctantly gave me the few required directions, 3
pleading from time to time that I change my mind. He shook my hand when I 3
left, as though he never expected to see me again. 3
3
"Take keer that old devil, Foster, don't git ye!" he warned again and again. "I 3
wouldn't go near him after dark fer love n'r money. No siree!" He re-entered his 3
store, solemnly shaking his head, while I set out along a road leading to the 3
outskirts of the town. 3
3
I had walked barely two minutes before I sighted the moor of which Haines had 3
spoken. The road, flanked by a whitewashed fence, passed over the great 3
swamp, which was overgrown with clumps of underbrush dipping down into 3
the dank, slimy ooze. An odor of deadness and decay filled the air, and even in 3
the sunlit afternoon little wisps of vapor could be seen rising from the 3
unhealthful spot. 3
3
On the opposite side of the moor I turned sharply to the left, as I had been 3
directed, branching from the main road. There were several houses in the 3
vicinity, I noticed; houses which were scarcely more than huts, reflecting the 3
extreme poverty of their owners. The road here passed under the drooping 3
branches of enormous willows which almost completely shut out the rays of the 3
sun. The miasmal odor of the swamp was still in my nostrils, and the air was 3
damp and chilly. I hurried my pace to get out of that dismal tunnel as soon as 3
possible. 3
3
3
3
1221 3
3
3
3
Presently I found myself in the light again. The sun, now hanging like a red ball 3
upon the crest of the mountain, was beginning to dip low, and there, some 3
distance ahead of me, bathed in its bloody iridescence, stood the lonely church. I 3
began to sense that uncanniness which Haines had mentioned, that feeling of 3
dread which made all Daalbergen shun the place. The squat, stone hulk of the 3
church itself, with its blunt steeple, seemed like an idol to which the tombstones 3
that surrounded it bowed down and worshipped, each with an arched top like 3
the shoulders of a kneeling person, while over the whole assemblage the dingy, 3
gray parsonage hovered like a wraith. 3
3
I had slowed my pace a trifle as I took in the scene. The sun was disappearing 3
behind the mountain very rapidly now, and the damp air chilled me. Turning 3
my coat collar up about my neck, I plodded on. Something caught my eye as I 3
glanced up again. In the shadow of the church wall was something white - a 3
thing which seemed to have no definite shape. Straining my eyes as I came 3
nearer, I saw that it was a cross of new timber, surmounting a mound of freshly- 3
turned earth. The discovery sent a new chill through me. I realized that this must 3
be my uncle's grave, but something told me that it was not like the other graves 3
near it. It did not seem like a dead grave. In some intangible way it appeared to 3
be living, if a grave can be said to live. Very close to it, I saw as I came nearer, 3
was another grave - an old mound with a crumbling stone about it. Dominie 3
Slott's tomb, I thought, remembering Haines' story. 3
3
There was no sign of life anywhere about the place. In the semi-twilight I 3
climbed the low knoll upon which the parsonage stood, and hammered upon the 3
door. There was no answer. I skirted the house and peered into the windows. 3
The whole place seemed deserted. 3
3
The lowering mountains had made night fall with disarming suddenness the 3
minute the sun was fully hidden. I realized that I could see scarcely more than a 3
few feet ahead of me. Feeling my way carefully, I rounded a corner of the house 3
and paused, wondering what to do next. 3
3
Everything was quiet. There was not a breath of wind, nor were there even the 3
usual noises made by animals in their nocturnal ramblings. All dread had been 3
forgotten for a time, but in the presence of that sepulchral calm my 3
apprehensions returned. I imagined the air peopled with ghastly spirits that 3
pressed around me, making the air almost unbreathable. I wondered, for the 3
hundredth time, where the old sexton might be. 3
3
As I stood there, half expecting some sinister demon to creep from the shadows, I 3
noticed two lighted windows glaring from the belfry of the church. I then 3
remembered what Haines had told me about Foster's living in the basement of 3
3
3
3
1222 3
3
3
3
the building. Advancing cautiously through the blackness, I found a side door of 3
the church ajar. 3
3
The interior had a musty and mildewed odor. Everything I touched was covered 3
with a cold, clammy moistore. I struck a match and began to explore, to discover, 3
if I could, how to get into the belfry. Suddenly I stopped in my tracks. 3
3
A snatch of song, loud and obscene, sung in a voice that was guttural and thick 3
with drink, came from above me. The match burned my fingers, and I dropped 3
it. Two pin-points of light pierced the darkness of the farther wall of the church, 3
and below them, to one side, I could see a door outlined where light filtered 3
through its cracks. The song stopped as abruptly as it had commenced, and there 3
was absolute silence again. My heart was thumping and blood raced through my 3
temples. Had I not been petrified with fear, I should have fled immediately. 3
3
Not caring to light another match, I felt my way among the pews until I stood in 3
front of the door. So deep was the feeling of depression which had come over me 3
that I felt as though I were acting in a dream. My actions were almost 3
involuntary. 3
3
The door was locked, as I found when I turned the knob. I hammered upon it for 3
some time, but there was no answer. The silence was as complete as before. 3
Feeling around the edge of the door, I found the hinges, removed the pins from 3
them, and allowed the door to fall toward me. Dim light flooded down a steep 3
flight of steps. There was a sickening odor of whiskey. I could now hear someone 3
stirring in the belfry room above. Venturing a low halloo, I thought I heard a 3
groan in reply, and cautiously climbed the stairs. 3
3
My first glance into that unhallowed place was indeed startling. Strewn about 3
the little room were old and dusty books and manuscripts - strange things that 3
bespoke almost unbelievable age. On rows of shelves which reached to the 3
ceiling were horrible things in glass jars and bottles - snakes and lizards and bats. 3
Dust and mold and cobwebs encrusted everything. In the center, behind a table 3
upon which was a lighted candle, a nearly empty bottle of whisky, and a glass, 3
was a motionless figure with a thin, scrawny, wrinkled face and wild eyes that 3
stared blankly through me. I recognized Abel Foster the old sexton, in an instant. 3
He did not move or speak as I came slowly and fearfully toward him. 3
3
"Mr. Foster?" I asked, trembling with unaccountable fear when I heard my voice 3
echo within the close confines of the room. There was no reply, and no 3
movement from the figure behind the table. I wondered if he had not drunk 3
himself to insensibility, and went behind the table to shake him. 3
3
3
3
1223 3
3
3
3
At the mere touch of my arm upon his shoulder, the strange old man started 3
from his chair as though terrified. His eyes, still having in them that same blank 3
stare, were fixed upon me. Swinging his arms like flails, he backed away. 3
3
"Don't!" he screamed. "Don't touch me! Go back - go back!" 3
3
I saw that he was both drunk and struck with some kind of a nameless terror. 3
Using a soothing tone, I told him who I was and why I had come. He seemed to 3
understand vaguely and sank back into his chair, sitting limp and motionless. 3
3
"I thought ye was him," he mumbled. "I thought ye was him come back fer it. 3
He's been a-tryin' t' get out - a-tryin' t' get out sence I put him in there." His 3
voice again rose to a scream and he clutched his chair. "Maybe he's got out now! 3
Maybe he's out!" 3
3
I looked about, half expecting to see some spectral shape coming up the stairs. 3
3
"Maybe who's out?" I inquired. 3
3
"Vanderhoof!" he shrieked. "Th' cross over his grave keeps fallin' down in th' 3
night! Every morning the earth is loose, and gets harder t' pat down. He'll come 3
out an' I won't be able t' do nothin'." 3
3
Forcing him back into the chair, I seated myself on a box near him. He was 3
trembling in mortal terror, with the saliva dripping from the corners of his 3
mouth. From time to time I felt that sense of horror which Haines had described 3
when he told me of the old sexton. Truly, there was something uncanny about 3
the man. His head had now sunk forward upon his breast, and he seemed 3
calmer, mumbling to himself. 3
3
I quietly arose and opened a window to let out the fumes of whisky and the 3
musty odor of dead things. Light from a dim moon, just risen, made objects 3
below barely visible. I could just see Dominie Vanderhoof's grave from my 3
position in the belfry, and blinked my eyes as I gazed at it. That cross was tilted! I 3
remembered that it had been vertical an hour ago. Fear took possession of me 3
again. I turned quickly. Foster sat in his chair watching me. His glance was saner 3
than before. 3
3
"So y're Vanderhoof's nephew," he mumbled in a nasal tone. "Waal, ye might's 3
well know it all. He'll be back after me afore long, he will jus' as soon as he can 3
get out o' that there grave. Ye might's well know all about it now." 3
3
3
3
1224 3
3
3
3
His terror appeared to have left him. He seemed resigned to some horrible fate 3
which he expected any minute. His head dropped down upon his chest again, 3
and he went on muttering in that nasal monotone. 3
3
"Ye see all them there books and papers? Waal, they was once Dominie Slott's - 3
Dominie Slott, who was here years ago. All them things is got t' do with magic - 3
black magic that th' old dominie knew afore he come t' this country. They used t' 3
burn 'em an' boil 'em in oil fer knowing' that over there, they did. But old Slott 3
knew, and he didn't go fer t' tell nobody. No sir, old Slott used to preach here 3
generations ago, an' he used to come up here an' study them books, an' use all 3
them dead things in jars, an' pronounce magic curses an' things, but he didn't let 3
nobody know it No, nobody knowed it but Dominie Slott an' me." 3
3
"You?" I ejaculated, leaning across the table toward him. 3
3
"That is, me after I learned it." His face showed lines of trickery as he answered 3
me. "I found all this stuff here when I come t' be church sexton, an' I used t' read 3
it when I wa'n't at work. An' I soon got t' know all about it." 3
3
The old man droned on, while I listened, spellbound. He told about learning the 3
difficult formulae of demonology, so that, by means of incantations, he could cast 3
spells over human beings. He had performed horrible occult rites of his hellish 3
creed, calling down anathema upon the town and its inhabitants. Crazed by his 3
desires, he tried to bring the church under his spell, but the power of God was 3
too strong. Finding Johannes Vanderhoof very weak-willed, he bewitched him so 3
that he preached strange and mystic sermons which struck fear into the simple 3
hearts of the country folk. From his position in the belfry room, he said, behind a 3
painting of the temptation of Christ which adorned the rear wall of the church, 3
he would glare at Vanderhoof while he was preaching, through holes which 3
were the eyes of the Devil in the picture. Terrified by the uncanny things which 3
were happening in their midst, the congregation left one by one, and Foster was 3
able to do what he pleased with the church and with Vanderhoof. 3
3
"But what did you do with him?" I asked in a hollow voice as the old sexton 3
paused in his confession. He burst into a cackle of laughter, throwing back his 3
head in drunken glee. 3
3
"I took his soul!" he howled in a tone that set me trembling. "I took his soul and 3
put it in a bottle - in a little black bottle! And I buried him! Bui he ain't got his 3
soul, an' he can't go neither t' heaven n'r hell! But he's a-comm' back after it. 3
He's a-trying' t' get out o' his grave now. I can hear him pushin' his way up 3
through the ground, he's that strong!" 3
3
3
3
1225 3
3
3
3
As the old man had proceeded with his story, I had become more and more 3
convinced that he must be telHng me the truth, and not merely gibbering in 3
drunkenness. Every detail fitted what Haines had told me. Fear was growing 3
upon me by degrees. With the old wizard now shouting with demoniac laughter, 3
I was tempted to bolt down the narrow stairway and leave that accursed 3
neighborhood. To calm myself, I rose and again looked out of the window. My 3
eyes nearly started from their sockets when I saw that the cross above 3
Vanderhoof's grave had fallen perceptibly since I had last looked at it. It was 3
now tilted to an angle of forty-five degrees! 3
3
"Can't we dig up Vanderhoof and restore his soul?" I asked almost breathlessly, 3
feeling that something must be done in a hurry. The old man rose from his chair 3
in terror. 3
3
"No, no, no!" he screamed. "He'd kill me! I've fergot th' formula, an' if he gets 3
out he'll be alive, without a soul. He'd kill us both!" 3
3
"Where is the bottle that contains his soul?" I asked, advancing threateningly 3
toward him. I felt that some ghastly thing was about to happen, which I must do 3
all in my power to prevent. 3
3
"I won't tell ye, ye young whelp!" he snarled. I felt, rather than saw, a queer light 3
in his eyes as he backed into a corner. "An' don't ye touch me, either, or ye'U 3
wish ye hadn't!" 3
3
I moved a step forward, noticing that on a low stool behind him there were two 3
black bottles. Foster muttered some peculiar words in a low, singsong voice. 3
Everything began to turn gray before my eyes, and something within me seemed 3
to be dragged upward, trying to get out at my throat I felt my knees become 3
weak. 3
3
Lurching forward, I caught the old sexton by the throat, and with my free arm 3
reached for the bottles on the stool. But the old man fell backward, striking the 3
stool with his foot, and one bottle fell to the floor as I snatched the other. There 3
was a flash of blue flame, and a sulfurous smell filled the room. From the little 3
heap of broken glass a white vapor rose and followed the draft out the window. 3
3
"Curse ye, ye rascal!" sounded a voice that seemed faint and far away. Foster, 3
whom I had released when the bottle broke, was crouching against the wall, 3
looking smaller and more shriveled than before. His face was slowly turning 3
greenish-black. 3
3
3
3
1226 3
3
3
3
"Curse ye!" said the voice again, hardly sounding as though it came from his 3
hps. "I'm done fer! That one in there was mine! Dominie Slott took it out two 3
hundred years ago!" 3
3
He shd slowly toward the floor, gazing at me with hatred in eyes that were 3
rapidly dimming. His flesh changed from white to black, and then to yellow. I 3
saw with horror that his body seemed to be crumbling away and his clothing 3
falling into limp folds. 3
3
The bottle in my hand was growing warm. I glanced at it, fearfully. It glowed 3
with a faint phosphorescence. Stiff with fright, I set it upon the table, but could 3
not keep my eyes from it There was an ominous moment of silence as its glow 3
became brighter, and then there came distinctly to my ears the sound of sliding 3
earth. Gasping for breath, I looked out of the window. The moon was now well 3
up in the sky, and by its light I could see that the fresh cross above Vanderhoof's 3
grave had completely fallen. Once again there came the sound of trickling gravel, 3
and no longer able to control myself, I stumbled down the stairs and found my 3
way out of doors. Falling now and then as I raced over the uneven ground, I ran 3
on in abject terror. When I had reached the foot of the knoll, at the entrance to 3
that gloomy tunnel beneath the willows, I heard a horrible roar behind me. 3
Turning, I glanced back toward the church. Its wall reflected the light of the 3
moon, and silhouetted against it was a gigantic, loathsome, black shadow 3
climbing from my uncle's grave and floundering gruesomely toward the church. 3
3
I told my story to a group of villagers in Haines' store the next morning. They 3
looked from one to the other with little smiles during the tale, I noticed, but 3
when I suggested that they accompany me to the spot, gave various excuses for 3
not caring to go. Though there seemed to be a limit to their credulity, they cared 3
to run no risks. I informed them that I would go alone, though I must confess 3
that the project did not appeal to me. 3
3
As I left the store, one old man with a long, white beard hurried after me and 3
caught my arm. 3
3
"I'll go wi' ye, lad," he said, "It do seem that I once beared my gran'pap tell o' 3
su'thin' o' the sort concernin' old Dominie Slott. A queer old man I've beared he 3
were, but Vanderhoof's been worse." 3
3
Dominie Vanderhoof's grave was open and deserted when we arrived. Of course 3
it could have been grave- robbers, the two of us agreed, and yet. . . In the belfry 3
the bottle which I had left upon the table was gone, though the fragments of the 3
broken one were found on the floor. And upon the heap of yellow dust and 3
3
3
3
1227 3
3
3
3
crumpled clothing that had once been Abel Foster were certain immense 3
footprints. 3
3
After glancing at some of the books and papers strewn about the belfry room, we 3
carried them down the stairs and burned them, as something unclean and 3
unholy. With a spade which we found in the church basement we filled in the 3
grave of Johannes Vanderhoof, and, as an afterthought, flung the fallen cross 3
upon the flames. 3
3
Old wives say that now, when the moon is full, there walks about the 3
churchyard a gigantic and bewildered figure clutching a bottle and seeking some 3
unremembered goal. 3

3
Before I try to rest I will set down these notes in preparation for the report I must 3
make. What I have found is so singular, and so contrary to all past experience 3
and expectations, that it deserves a very careful description. 3
3
I reached the main landing on Venus, March 18, terrestrial time; VI, 9 of the 3
planet's calendar. Being put in the main group under Miller, I received my 3
equipment - watch tuned to Venus's slightly quicker rotation - and went through 3
the usual mask drill. After two days I was pronounced fit for duty. 3
3
Leaving the Crystal Company's post at Terra Nova around dawn, VI, 12, I 3
followed the southerly route which Anderson had mapped out from the air. The 3
going was bad, for these jungles are always half impassable after a rain. It must 3
be the moisture that gives the tangled vines and creepers that leathery toughness; 3
a toughness so great that a knife has to work ten minutes on some of them. By 3
noon it was dryer - the vegetation getting soft and rubbery so that my knife went 3
through it easily - but even then I could not make much speed. These Carter 3
oxygen masks are too heavy - just carrying one half wears an ordinary man out. 3
A Dubois mask with sponge-reservoir instead of tubes would give just as good 3
air at half the weight. 3
3
The crystal-detector seemed to function well, pointing steadily in a direction 3
verifying Anderson's report. It is curious how that principle of affinity works - 3
without any of the fakery of the old 'divining rods' back home. There must be a 3
great deposit of crystals within a thousand miles, though I suppose those 3
damnable man-lizards always watch and guard it. Possibly they think we are just 3
as foolish for coming to Venus to hunt the stuff as we think they are for 3
grovelling in the mud whenever they see a piece of it, or for keeping that great 3
mass on a pedestal in their temple. I wish they'd get a new religion, for they have 3
no use for the crystals except to pray to. Barring theology, they would let us take 3
all we want - and even if they learned to tap them for power there'd be more 3
than enough for their planet and the earth besides. I for one am tired of passing 3
up the main deposits and merely seeking separate crystals out of jungle river- 3
beds. Sometime I'll urge the wiping out of these scaly beggars by a good stiff 3
army from home. About twenty ships could bring enough troops across to turn 3
3
3
3
1229 3
3
3
3
the trick. One can't call the damned things men for all their 'cities' and towers. 3
They haven't any skill except building - and using swords and poison darts - and 3
I don't believe their so-called 'cities' mean much more than ant-hills or beaver- 3
dams. I doubt if they even have a real language - all the talk about psychological 3
communication through those tentacles down their chests strikes me as bunk. 3
What misleads people is their upright posture; just an accidental physical 3
resemblance to terrestrial man. 3
3
I'd like to go through a Venus jungle for once without having to watch out for 3
skulking groups of them or dodge their cursed darts. They may have been all 3
right before we began to take the crystals, but they're certainly a bad enough 3
nuisance now - with their dart-shooting and their cutting of our water pipes. 3
More and more I come to believe that they have a special sense like our crystal- 3
detectors. No one ever knew them to bother a man - apart from long-distance 3
sniping - who didn't have crystals on him. 3
3
Around 1 P.M. a dart nearly took my helmet off, and I thought for a second one 3
of my oxygen tubes was punctured. The sly devils hadn't made a sound, but 3
three of them were closing in on me. I got them all by sweeping in a circle with 3
my flame pistol, for even though their colour blended with the jungle, I could 3
spot the moving creepers. One of them was fully eight feet tall, with a snout like 3
a tapir's. The other two were average seven-footers. All that makes them hold 3
their own is sheer numbers - even a single regiment of flame throwers could 3
raise hell with them. It is curious, though, how they've come to be dominant on 3
the planet. Not another living thing higher than the wriggling akmans and 3
skorahs, or the flying tukahs of the other continent - unless of course those holes 3
in the Dionaean Plateau hide something. 3
3
About two o'clock my detector veered westward, indicating isolated crystals 3
ahead on the right. This checked up with Anderson, and I turned my course 3
accordingly. It was harder going - not only because the ground was rising, but 3
because the animal life and carnivorous plants were thicker. I was always 3
slashing ugrats and stepping on skorahs, and my leather suit was all speckled 3
from the bursting darohs which struck it from all sides. The sunlight was all the 3
worse because of the mist, and did not seem to dry up the mud in the least. 3
Every time I stepped my feet sank down five or six inches, and there was a 3
sucking sort of blup every time I pulled them out. I wish somebody would 3
invent a safe kind of suiting other than leather for this climate. Cloth of course 3
would rot; but some thin metallic tissue that couldn't tear - like the surface of this 3
revolving decay-proof record scroll - ought to be feasible sometime. 3
3
I ate about 3:30 - if slipping these wretched food tablets through my mask can be 3
called eating. Soon after that I noticed a decided change in the landscape - the 3
3
3
3
1230 3
3
3
3
bright, poisonous-looking flowers shifting in colour and getting wraith-like. The 3
outlines of everything shimmered rhythmically, and bright points of light 3
appeared and danced in the same slow, steady tempo. After that the temperature 3
seemed to fluctuate in unison with a peculiar rhythmic drumming. 3
3
The whole universe seemed to be throbbing in deep, regular pulsations that filled 3
every corner of space and flowed through my body and mind alike. I lost all 3
sense of equilibrium and staggered dizzily, nor did it change things in the least 3
when I shut my eyes and covered my ears with my hands. However, my mind 3
was still clear, and in a very few minutes I realized what had happened. 3
3
I had encountered at last one of those curious mirage-plants about which so 3
many of our men told stories. Anderson had warned me of them, and described 3
their appearance very closely - the shaggy stalk, the spiky leaves, and the 3
mottled blossoms whose gaseous, dream-breeding exhalations penetrate every 3
existing make of mask. 3
3
Recalling what happened to Bailey three years ago, I fell into a momentary panic, 3
and began to dash and stagger about in the crazy, chaotic world which the 3
plant's exhalations had woven around me. Then good sense came back, and I 3
realized all I need do was retreat from the dangerous blossoms - heading away 3
from the source of the pulsations, and cutting a path blindly - regardless of what 3
might seem to swirl around me - until safely out of the plant's effective radius. 3
3
Although everything was spinning perilously, I tried to start in the right 3
direction and hack my way ahead. My route must have been far from straight, 3
for it seemed hours before I was free of the mirage- plant's pervasive influence. 3
Gradually the dancing lights began to disappear, and the shimmering spectral 3
scenery began to assume the aspect of solidity. When I did get wholly clear I 3
looked at my watch and was astonished to find that the time was only 4:20. 3
Though eternities had seemed to pass, the whole experience could have 3
consumed little more than a half-hour. 3
3
Every delay, however, was irksome, and I had lost ground in my retreat from the 3
plant. I now pushed ahead in the uphill direction indicated by the crystal- 3
detector, bending every energy toward making better time. The jungle was still 3
thick, though there was less animal life. Once a carnivorous blossom engulfed 3
my right foot and held it so tightly that I had to hack it free with my knife; 3
reducing the flower to strips before it let go. 3
3
In less than an hour I saw that the jungle growths were thinning out, and by five 3
o'clock - after passing through a belt of tree-ferns with very little underbrush - I 3
emerged on a broad mossy plateau. My progress now became rapid, and I saw 3
3
3
3
1231 3
3
3
3
by the wavering of my detector-needle that I was getting relatively close to the 3
crystal I sought. This was odd, for most of the scattered, egg-like spheroids 3
occurred in jungle streams of a sort not likely to be found on this treeless upland. 3
3
The terrain sloped upward, ending in a definite crest. I reached the top about 3
5:30 and saw ahead of me a very extensive plain with forests in the distance. 3
This, without question, was the plateau mapped by Matsugawa from the air fifty 3
years ago, and called on our maps 'Eryx' or the 'Erycinian Highland.' But what 3
made my heart leap was a smaller detail, whose position could not have been far 3
from the plain's exact centre. It was a single point of light, blazing through the 3
mist and seeming to draw a piercing, concentrated luminescence from the 3
yellowish, vapour-dulled sunbeams. This, without doubt, was the crystal I 3
sought - a thing possibly no larger than a hen's egg, yet containing enough 3
power to keep a city warm for a year. I could hardly wonder, as I glimpsed the 3
distant glow, that those miserable man-lizards worship such crystals. And yet 3
they have not the least notion of the powers they contain. 3
3
Breaking into a rapid run, I tried to reach the unexpected prize as soon as 3
possible; and was annoyed when the firm moss gave place to a thin, singularly 3
detestable mud studded with occasional patches of weeds and creepers. But I 3
splashed on heedlessly - scarcely thinking to look around for any of the skulking 3
man-lizards. In this open space I was not very likely to be waylaid. As I 3
advanced, the light ahead seemed to grow in size and brilliancy, and I began to 3
notice some peculiarity in its situation. Clearly, this was a crystal of the very 3
finest quality, and my elation grew with every spattering step. 3
3
It is now that I must begin to be careful in making my report, since what I shall 3
henceforward have to say involves unprecedented - though fortunately verifiable 3
- matters. I was racing ahead with mounting eagerness, and had come within a 3
hundred yards or so of the crystal - whose position on a sort of raised place in the 3
omnipresent slime seemed very odd - when a sudden, overpowering force struck 3
my chest and the knuckles of my clenched fists and knocked me over backward 3
into the mud. The splash of my fall was terrific, nor did the softness of the 3
ground and the presence of some slimy weeds and creepers save my head from a 3
bewildering jarring. For a moment I lay supine, too utterly startled to think. Then 3
I half mechanically stumbled to my feet and began to scrape the worst of the 3
mud and scum from my leather suit. 3
3
Of what I had encountered I could not form the faintest idea. I had seen nothing 3
which could have caused the shock, and I saw nothing now. Had I, after all, 3
merely slipped in the mud? My sore knuckles and aching chest forbade me to 3
think so. Or was this whole incident an illusion brought on by some hidden 3
mirage-plant? It hardly seemed probable, since I had none of the usual 3
3
3
3
1232 3
3
3
3
symptoms, and since there was no place near by where so vivid and typical a 3
growth could lurk unseen. Had I been on the earth, I would have suspected a 3
barrier of N-force laid down by some government to mark a forbidden zone, but 3
in this humanless region such a notion would have been absurd. 3
3
Finally pulling myself together, I decided to investigate in a cautious way. 3
Holding my knife as far as possible ahead of me, so that it might be first to feel 3
the strange force, I started once more for the shining crystal - preparing to 3
advance step by step with the greatest deliberation. At the third step I was 3
brought up short by the impact of the knife - point on an apparently solid surface 3
3
- a solid surface where my eyes saw nothing. 3
3
After a moment's recoil I gained boldness. Extending my gloved left hands I 3
verified the presence of invisible solid matter - or a tactile illusion of solid matter 3
3
- ahead of me. Upon moving my hand I found that the barrier was of substantial 3
extent, and of an almost glassy smoothness, with no evidence of the joining of 3
separate blocks. Nerving myself for further experiments, I removed a glove and 3
tested the thing with my bare hand. It was indeed hard and glassy, and of a 3
curious coldness as contrasted with the air around. I strained my eyesight to the 3
utmost in an effort to glimpse some trace of the obstructing substance, but could 3
discern nothing whatsoever. There was not even any evidence of refractive 3
power as judged by the aspect of the landscape ahead. Absence of reflective 3
power was proved by the lack of a glowing image of the sun at any point. 3
3
Burning curiosity began to displace all other feelings, and I enlarged my 3
investigations as best I could. Exploring with my hands, I found that the barrier 3
extended from the ground to some level higher than I could reach, and that it 3
stretched off indefinitely on both sides. It was, then, a wall of some kind - though 3
all guesses as to its materials and its purpose were beyond me. Again I thought 3
of the mirage-plant and the dreams it induced, but a moment's reasoning put 3
this out of my head. 3
3
Knocking sharply on the barrier with the hilt of my knife, and kicking at it with 3
my heavy boots, I tried to interpret the sounds thus made. There was something 3
suggestive of cement or concrete in these reverberations, though my hands had 3
found the surface more glassy or metallic in feel. Certainly, I was confronting 3
something strange beyond all previous experience. 3
3
The next logical move was to get some idea of the wall's dimensions. The height 3
problem would be hard, if not insoluble, but the length and shape problem could 3
perhaps be sooner dealt with. Stretching out my arms and pressing close to the 3
barrier, I began to edge gradually to the left - keeping very careful track of the 3
way I faced. After several steps I concluded that the wall was not straight, but 3
3
3
3
1233 3
3
3
3
that I was following part of some vast circle or ellipse. And then my attention 3
was distracted by something wholly different - something connected with the 3
still-distant crystal which had formed the object of my quest. 3
3
I have said that even from a great distance the shining object's position seemed 3
indefinably queer - on a slight mound rising from the slime. Now - at about a 3
hundred yards - I could see plainly despite the engulfing mist just what that 3
mound was. It was the body of a man in one of the Crystal Company's leather 3
suits, lying on his back, and with his oxygen mask half buried in the mud a few 3
inches away. In his right hand, crushed convulsively against his chest, was the 3
crystal which had led me here - a spheroid of incredible size, so large that the 3
dead fingers could scarcely close over it. Even at the given distance I could see 3
that the body was a recent one. There was little visible decay, and I reflected that 3
in this climate such a thing meant death not more than a day before. Soon the 3
hateful farnoth-flies would begin to cluster about the corpse. I wondered who the 3
man was. Surely no one I had seen on this trip. It must have been one of the old- 3
timers absent on a long roving commission, who had come to this especial region 3
independently of Anderson's survey. There he lay, past all trouble, and with the 3
rays of the great crystal streaming out from between his stiffened fingers. 3
3
For fully five minutes I stood there staring in bewilderment and apprehension. A 3
curious dread assailed me, and I had an unreasonable impulse to run away. It 3
could not have been done by those slinking man- lizards, for he still held the 3
crystal he had found. Was there any connexion with the invisible wall? Where 3
had he found the crystal? Anderson's instrument had indicated one in this 3
quarter well before this man could have perished. I now began to regard the 3
unseen barrier as something sinister, and recoiled from it with a shudder. Yet I 3
knew I must probe the mystery all the more quickly and thoroughly because of 3
this recent tragedy. 3
3
Suddenly - wrenching my mind back to the problem I faced - I thought of a 3
possible means of testing the wall's height, or at least of finding whether or not it 3
extended indefinitely upward. Seizing a handful of mud, I let it drain until it 3
gained some coherence and then flung it high in the air toward the utterly 3
transparent barrier. At a height of perhaps fourteen feet it struck the invisible 3
surface with a resounding splash, disintegrating at once and oozing downward 3
in disappearing streams with surprising rapidity. Plainly, the wall was a lofty 3
one. A second handful, hurled at an even sharper angle, hit the surface about 3
eighteen feet from the ground and disappeared as quickly as the first. 3
3
I now summoned up all my strength and prepared to throw a third handful as 3
high as I possibly could. Letting the mud drain, and squeezing it to maximum 3
dryness, I flung it up so steeply that I feared it might not reach the obstructing 3
3
3
3
1234 3
3
3
3
surface at all. It did, however, and this time it crossed the barrier and fell in the 3
mud beyond with a violent spattering. At last I had a rough idea of the height of 3
the wall, for the crossing had evidently occurred some twenty or twenty-one feet 3
aloft. 3
3
With a nineteen - or twenty-foot vertical wall of glassy flatness, ascent was 3
clearly impossible. I must, then, continue to circle the barrier in the hope of 3
finding a gate, an ending, or some sort of interruption. Did the obstacle form a 3
complete round or other closed figure, or was it merely an arc or semi-circle? 3
Acting on my decision, I resumed my slow leftward circling, moving my hands 3
up and down over the unseen surface on the chance of finding some window or 3
other small aperture. Before starting, I tried to mark my position by kicking a 3
hole in the mud, but found the slime too thin to hold any impression. I did, 3
though, gauge the place approximately by noting a tall cycad in the distant forest 3
which seemed just on a line with the gleaming crystal a hundred yards away. If 3
no gate or break existed I could now tell when I had completely circumnavigated 3
the wall. 3
3
I had not progressed far before I decided that the curvature indicated a circular 3
enclosure of about a hundred yards' diameter - provided the outline was regular. 3
This would mean that the dead man lay near the wall at a point almost opposite 3
the region where I had started. Was he just inside or just outside the enclosure? 3
This I would soon ascertain. 3
3
As I slowly rounded the barrier without finding any gate, window, or other 3
break, I decided that the body was lying within. On closer view the features of 3
the dead man seemed vaguely disturbing. I found something alarming in his 3
expression, and in the way the glassy eyes stared. By the time I was very near I 3
believed I recognized him as Dwight, a veteran whom I had never known, but 3
who was pointed out to me at the post last year. The crystal he clutched was 3
certainly a prize - the largest single specimen I had ever seen. 3
3
I was so near the body that I could - but for the barrier - have touched it, when 3
my exploring left hand encountered a corner in the unseen surface. In a second I 3
had learned that there was an opening about three feet wide, extending from the 3
ground to a height greater than I could reach. There was no door, nor any 3
evidence of hingemarks bespeaking a former door. Without a moment's 3
hesitation I stepped through and advanced two paces to the prostrate body - 3
which lay at right angles to the hallway I had entered, in what seemed to be an 3
intersecting doorless corridor. It gave me a fresh curiosity to find that the interior 3
of this vast enclosure was divided by partitions. 3
3
3
3
1235 3
3
3
3
Bending to examine the corpse, I discovered that it bore no wounds. This 3
scarcely surprised me, since the continued presence of the crystal argued against 3
the pseudo-reptilian natives. Looking about for some possible cause of death, my 3
eyes lit upon the oxygen mask lying close to the body's feet. Here, indeed, was 3
something significant. Without this device no human being could breathe the air 3
of Venus for more than thirty seconds, and Dwight - if it were he - had obviously 3
lost his. Probably it had been carelessly buckled, so that the weight of the tubes 3
worked the straps loose - a thing which could not happen with a Dubois sponge- 3
reservoir mask. The half-minute of grace had been too short to allow the man to 3
stoop and recover his protection - or else the cyanogen content of the atmosphere 3
was abnormally high at the time. Probably he had been busy admiring the crystal 3
- wherever he may have found it. He had, apparently, just taken it from the 3
pouch in his suit, for the flap was unbuttoned. 3
3
I now proceeded to extricate the huge crystal from the dead prospector's fingers - 3
a task which the body's stiffness made very difficult. The spheroid was larger 3
than a man's fist, and glowed as if alive in the reddish rays of the weltering sun. 3
As I touched the gleaming surface I shuddered involuntarily - as if by taking this 3
precious object I had transferred to myself the doom which had overtaken its 3
earlier bearer. However, my qualms soon passed, and I carefully buttoned the 3
crystal into the pouch of my leather suit. Superstition has never been one of my 3
failings. 3
3
Placing the man's helmet over his dead, staring face, I straightened up and 3
stepped back through the unseen doorway to the entrance hall of the great 3
enclosure. All my curiosity about the strange edifice now returned, and I racked 3
my brains with speculations regarding its material, origin, and purpose. That the 3
hands of men had reared it I could not for a moment believe. Our ships first 3
reached Venus only seventy-two years ago, and the only human beings on the 3
planet have been those at Terra Nova. Nor does human knowledge include any 3
perfectly transparent, non-refractive solid such as the substance of this building. 3
Prehistoric human invasions of Venus can be pretty well ruled out, so that one 3
must turn to the idea of native construction. Did a forgotten race of highly- 3
evolved beings precede the man-lizards as masters of Venus? Despite their 3
elaborately-built cities, it seemed hard to credit the pseudo-reptiles with 3
anything of this kind. There must have been another race aeons ago, of which 3
this is perhaps the last relique. Or will other ruins of kindred origin be found by 3
future expeditions? The purpose of such a structure passes all conjecture - but its 3
strange and seemingly non-practical material suggests a religious use. 3
3
Realizing my inability to solve these problems, I decided that all I could do was 3
to explore the invisible structure itself. That various rooms and corridors 3
extended over the seemingly unbroken plain of mud I felt convinced; and I 3
3
3
3
1236 3
3
3
3
believed that a knowledge of their plan might lead to something significant. So, 3
feeling my way back through the doorway and edging past the body, I began to 3
advance along the corridor toward those interior regions whence the dead man 3
had presumably come. Later on I would investigate the hallway I had left. 3
3
Groping like a blind man despite the misty sunlight, I moved slowly onward. 3
Soon the corridor turned sharply and began to spiral in toward the centre in 3
ever-diminishing curves. Now and then my touch would reveal a doorless 3
intersecting passage, and I several times encountered junctions with two, three, 3
and four diverging avenues. In these latter cases I always followed the inmost 3
route, which seemed to form a continuation of the one I had been traversing. 3
There would be plenty of time to examine the branches after I had reached and 3
returned from the main regions. I can scarcely describe the strangeness of the 3
experience - threading the unseen ways of an invisible structure reared by 3
forgotten hands on an alien planet! 3
3
At last, still stumbling and groping, I felt the corridor end in a sizeable open 3
space. Fumbling about, I found I was in a circular chamber about ten feet across; 3
and from the position of the dead man against certain distant forest landmarks I 3
judged that this chamber lay at or near the centre of the edifice. Out of it opened 3
five corridors besides the one through which I had entered, but I kept the latter 3
in mind by sighting very carefully past the body to a particular tree on the 3
horizon as I stood just within the entrance. 3
3
There was nothing in this room to distinguish it - merely the floor of thin mud 3
which was everywhere present. Wondering whether this part of the building had 3
any roof, I repeated my experiment with an upward-flung handful of mud, and 3
found at once that no covering existed. If there had ever been one, it must have 3
fallen long ago, for not a trace of debris or scattered blocks ever halted my feet. 3
As I reflected, it struck me as distinctly odd that this apparently primordial 3
structure should be so devoid of tumbling masonry, gaps in the walls, and other 3
common attributes of dilapidation. 3
3
What was it? What had it ever been? Of what was it made? Why was there no 3
evidence of separate blocks in the glassy, bafflingly homogenous walls? Why 3
were there no traces of doors, either interior or exterior? I knew only that I was in 3
a round, roofless, doorless edifice of some hard, smooth, perfectly transparent, 3
non-refractive and non-reflective material, a hundred yards in diameter, with 3
many corridors, and with a small circular room at the centre. More than this I 3
could never learn from a direct investigation. 3
3
I now observed that the sun was sinking very low in the west - a golden-ruddy 3
disc floating in a pool of scarlet and orange above the mist-clouded trees of the 3
3
3
3
1237 3
3
3
3
horizon. Plainly, I would have to hurry if I expected to choose a sleeping-spot on 3
dry ground before dark. I had long before decided to camp for the night on the 3
firm, mossy rim of the plateau near the crest whence I had first spied the shining 3
crystal, trusting to my usual luck to save me from an attack by the man-lizards. It 3
has always been my contention that we ought to travel in parties of two or more, 3
so that someone can be on guard during sleeping hours, but the really small 3
number of night attacks makes the Company careless about such things. Those 3
scaly wretches seem to have difficulty in seeing at night, even with curious glow 3
torches. 3
3
Having picked out again the hallway through which I had come, I started to 3
return to the structure's entrance. Additional exploration could wait for another 3
day. Groping a course as best I could through the spiral corridors - with only 3
general sense, memory, and a vague recognition of some of the ill-defined weed 3
patches on the plain as guides - I soon found myself once more in close proximity 3
to the corpse. There were now one or two farnoth flies swooping over the 3
helmet-covered face, and I knew that decay was setting in. With a futile 3
instinctive loathing I raised my hand to brush away his vanguard of the 3
scavengers - when a strange and astonishing thing became manifest. An invisible 3
wall, checking the sweep of my arm, told me that - notwithstanding my careful 3
retracing of the way - I had not indeed returned to the corridor in which the 3
body lay. Instead, I was in a parallel hallway, having no doubt taken some 3
wrong turn or fork among the intricate passages behind. 3
3
Hoping to find a doorway to the exit hall ahead, I continued my advance, but 3
presently came to a blank wall. I would, then, have to return to the central 3
chamber and steer my course anew. Exactly where I had made my mistake I 3
could not tell. I glanced at the ground to see if by any miracle guiding footprints 3
had remained, but at once realized that the thin mud held impressions only for a 3
very few moments. There was little difficulty in finding my way to the centre 3
again, and once there I carefully reflected on the proper outward course. I had 3
kept too far to the right before. This time I must take a more leftward fork 3
somewhere - just where, I could decide as I went. 3
3
As I groped ahead a second time I felt quite confident of my correctness, and 3
diverged to the left at a junction I was sure I remembered. The spiralling 3
continued, and I was careful not to stray into any intersecting passages. Soon, 3
however, I saw to my disgust that I was passing the body at a considerable 3
distance; this passage evidently reached the outer wall at a point much beyond it. 3
In the hope that another exit might exist in the half of the wall I had not yet 3
explored, I pressed forward for several paces, but eventually came once more to 3
a solid barrier. Clearly, the plan of the building was even more complicated than 3
I had thought. 3
3
3
3
1238 3
3
3
3
I now debated whether to return to the centre again or whether to try some of the 3
lateral corridors extending toward the body. If I chose this second alternative, I 3
would run the risk of breaking my mental pattern of where I was; hence I had 3
better not attempt it unless I could think of some way of leaving a visible trail 3
behind me. Just how to leave a trail would be quite a problem, and I ransacked 3
my mind for a solution. There seemed to be nothing about my person which 3
could leave a mark on anything, nor any material which I could scatter - or 3
minutely subdivide and scatter. 3
3
My pen had no effect on the invisible wall, and I could not lay a trail of my 3
precious food tablets. Even had I been willing to spare the latter, there would not 3
have been even nearly enough - besides which the small pellets would have 3
instantly sunk from sight in the thin mud. I searched my pockets for an old- 3
fashioned note-book - often used unofficially on Venus despite the quick rotting- 3
rate of paper in the planet's atmosphere - whose pages I could tear up and 3
scatter, but could find none. It was obviously impossible to tear the tough, thin 3
metal of this revolving decay -proof record scroll, nor did my clothing offer any 3
possibilities. In Venus's peculiar atmosphere I could not safely spare my stout 3
leather suit, and underwear had been eliminated because of the climate. 3
3
I tried to smear mud on the smooth, invisible walls after squeezing it as dry as 3
possible, but found that it slipped from sight as quickly as did the height-testing 3
handfuls I had previously thrown. Finally I drew out my knife and attempted to 3
scratch a line on the glassy, phantom surface - something I could recognize with 3
my hand, even though I would not have the advantage of seeing it from afar. It 3
was useless, however, for the blade made not the slightest impression on the 3
baffling, unknown material. 3
3
Frustrated in all attempts to blaze a trail, I again sought the round central 3
chamber through memory. It seemed easier to act back to this room than to steer 3
a definite, predetermined course away from it, and I had little difficulty in 3
finding it anew. This time I listed on my record scroll every turn I made - 3
drawing a crude hypothetical diagram of my route, and marking all diverging 3
corridors. It was, of course, maddeningly slow work when everything had to be 3
determined by touch, and the possibilities of error were infinite; but I believed it 3
would pay in the long run. 3
3
The long twilight of Venus was thick when I reached the central room, but I still 3
had hopes of gaining the outside before dark. Comparing my fresh diagram with 3
previous recollections, I believed I had located my original mistake, so once more 3
set out confidently along the invisible hall-ways. I veered further to the left than 3
during my previous attempts, and tried to keep track of my turnings on the 3
records scroll in case I was still mistaken. In the gathering dusk I could see the 3
3
3
3
1239 3
3
3
3
dim line of the corpse, now the centre of a loathsome cloud of farnoth-flies. 3
Before long, no doubt, the mud-dwelling sificlighs would be oozing in from the 3
plain to complete the ghastly work. Approaching the body with some reluctance 3
I was preparing to step past it when a sudden collision with a wall told me I was 3
again astray. 3
3
I now realized plainly that I was lost. The complications of this building were too 3
much for offhand solution, and I would probably have to do some careful 3
checking before I could hope to emerge. Still, I was eager to get to dry ground 3
before total darkness set in; hence I returned once more to the centre and began a 3
rather aimless series of trials and errors - making notes by the light of my electric 3
lamp. When I used this device I noticed with interest that it produced no 3
reflection - not even the faintest glistening - in the transparent walls around me. I 3
was, however, prepared for this; since the sun had at no time formed a gleaming 3
image in the strange material. 3
3
I was still groping about when the dusk became total. A heavy mist obscured 3
most of the stars and planets, but the earth was plainly visible as a glowing, 3
bluish-green point in the southeast. It was just past opposition, and would have 3
been a glorious sight in a telescope. I could even make out the moon beside it 3
whenever the vapours momentarily thinned. It was now impossible to see the 3
corpse - my only landmark - so I blundered back to the central chamber after a 3
few false turns. After all, I would have to give up hope of sleeping on dry 3
ground. Nothing could be done till daylight, and I might as well make the best of 3
it here. Lying down in the mud would not be pleasant, but in my leather suit it 3
could be done. On former expeditions I had slept under even worse conditions, 3
and now sheer exhaustion would help to conquer repugnance. 3
3
So here I am, squatting in the slime of the central room and making these notes 3
on my record scroll by the light of the electric lamp. There is something almost 3
humorous in my strange, unprecedented plight. Lost in a building without doors 3
- a building which I cannot see! I shall doubtless get out early in the morning, 3
and ought to be back at Terra Nova with the crystal by late afternoon. It certainly 3
is a beauty - with surprising lustre even in the feeble light of this lamp. I have 3
just had it out examining it. Despite my fatigue, sleep is slow in coming, so I find 3
myself writing at great length. I must stop now. Not much danger of being 3
bothered by those cursed natives in this place. The thing I like least is the corpse - 3
but fortunately my oxygen mask saves me from the worst effects. I am using the 3
chlorate cubes very sparingly. Will take a couple of food tablets now and turn in. 3
More later. 3
3
LATER - AFTERNOON, VI, 13 3
3
3
3
1240 3
3
3
3
There has been more trouble than I expected. I am still in the building, and will 3
have to work quickly and wisely if I expect to rest on dry ground tonight. It took 3
me a long time to get to sleep, and I did not wake till almost noon today. As it 3
was, I would have slept longer but for the glare of the sun through the haze. The 3
corpse was a rather bad sight - wriggling with sificlighs, and with a cloud of 3
farnoth-flies around it. Something had pushed the helmet away from the face, 3
and it was better not to look at it. I was doubly glad of my oxygen mask when I 3
thought of the situation. 3
3
At length I shook and brushed myself dry, took a couple of food tablets, and put 3
a new potassium chlorate cube in the electrolyser of the mask. I am using these 3
cubes slowly, but wish I had a larger supply. I felt much better after my sleep, 3
and expected to get out of the building very shortly. 3
3
Consulting the notes and sketches I had jotted down, I was impressed by the 3
complexity of the hallways, and by the possibility that I had made a fundamental 3
error. Of the six openings leading out of the central space, I had chosen a certain 3
one as that by which I had entered - using a sighting-arrangement as a guide. 3
When I stood just within the opening, the corpse fifty yards away was exactly in 3
line with a particular lepidodendron in the far-off forest. Now it occurred to me 3
that this sighting might not have been of sufficient accuracy - the distance of the 3
corpse making its difference of direction in relation to the horizon comparatively 3
slight when viewed from the openings next to that of my first ingress. Moreover, 3
the tree did not differ as distinctly as it might from other lepidodendra on the 3
horizon. 3
3
Putting the matter to a test, I found to my chagrin that I could not be sure which 3
of three openings was the right one. Had I traversed a different set of windings at 3
each attempted exit? This time I would be sure. It struck me that despite the 3
impossibility of trail-blazing there was one marker I could leave. Though I could 3
not spare my suit, I could - because of my thick head of hair - spare my helmet; 3
and this was large and light enough to remain visible above the thin mud. 3
Accordingly I removed the roughly hemi-spherical device and laid it at the 3
entrance of one of the corridors - the right-hand one of the three I must try. 3
3
I would follow this corridor on the assumption that it was correct; repeating 3
what I seemed to recall as the proper turns, and constantly consulting and 3
making notes. If I did not get out, I would systematically exhaust all possible 3
variations; and if these failed, I would proceed to cover the avenues extending 3
from the next opening in the same way - continuing to the third opening if 3
necessary. Sooner or later I could not avoid hitting the right path to the exit, but I 3
must use patience. Even at worst, I could scarcely fail to reach the open plain in 3
time for a dry night's sleep. 3
3
3
3
1241 3
3
3
3
Immediate results were rather discouraging, though they helped me eliminate 3
the right-hand opening in little more than an hour. Only a succession of blind 3
alleys, each ending at a great distance from the corpse, seemed to branch from 3
this hallway; and I saw very soon that it had not figured at all in the previous 3
afternoon's wanderings. As before, however, I always found it relatively easy to 3
grope back to the central chamber. 3
3
About 1 P.M. I shifted my helmet marker to the next opening and began to 3
explore the hallways beyond it. At first I thought I recognized the turnings, but 3
soon found myself in a wholly unfamiliar set of corridors. I could not get near 3
the corpse, and this time seemed cut off from the central chamber as well, even 3
though I thought I had recorded every move I made. There seemed to be tricky 3
twists and crossings too subtle for me to capture in my crude diagrams, and I 3
began to develop a kind of mixed anger and discouragement. While patience 3
would of course win in the end, I saw that my searching would have to be 3
minute, tireless and long-continued. 3
3
Two o'clock found me still wandering vainly through strange corridors - 3
constantly feeling my way, looking alternately at my helmet and at the corpse, 3
and jotting data on my scroll with decreasing confidence. I cursed the stupidity 3
and idle curiosity which had drawn me into this tangle of unseen walls - 3
reflecting that if I had let the thing alone and headed back as soon as I had taken 3
the crystal from the body, I would even now be safe at Terra Nova. 3
3
Suddenly it occurred to me that I might be able to tunnel under the invisible 3
walls with my knife, and thus effect a short cut to the outside - or to some 3
outward-leading corridor. I had no means of knowing how deep the building's 3
foundations were, but the omnipresent mud argued the absence of any floor save 3
the earth. Facing the distant and increasingly horrible corpse, I began a course of 3
feverish digging with the broad, sharp blade. 3
3
There was about six inches of semi-liquid mud, below which the density of the 3
soil increased sharply. This lower soil seemed to be of a different colour - a 3
greyish clay rather like the formations near Venus's north pole. As I continued 3
downward close to the unseen barrier I saw that the ground was getting harder 3
and harder. Watery mud rushed into the excavation as fast as I removed the clay, 3
but I reached through it and kept on working. If I could bore any kind of a 3
passage beneath the wall, the mud would not stop my wriggling out. 3
3
About three feet down, however, the hardness of the soil halted my digging 3
seriously. Its tenacity was beyond anything I had encountered before, even on 3
this planet, and was linked with an anomalous heaviness. My knife had to split 3
and chip the tightly packed clay, and the fragments I brought up were like solid 3
3
3
3
1242 3
3
3
3
stones or bits of metal. Finally even this splitting and chipping became 3
impossible, and I had to cease my work with no lower edge of wall in reach. 3
3
The hour-long attempt was a wasteful as well as futile one, for it used up great 3
stores of my energy and forced me both to take an extra food tablet, and to put 3
an additional chlorate cube in the oxygen mask. It has also brought a pause in the 3
day's gropings, for I am still much too exhausted to walk. After cleaning my 3
hands and arms of the worst of the mud I sat down to write these notes - leaning 3
against an invisible wall and facing away from the corpse. 3
3
That body is simply a writhing mass of vermin now - the odour has begun to 3
draw some of the slimy akmans from the far-off jungle. I notice that many of the 3
efjeh-weeds on the plain are reaching out necrophagous feelers toward the thing; 3
but I doubt if any are long enough to reach it. I wish some really carnivorous 3
organisms like the skorahs would appear, for then they might scent me and 3
wriggle a course through the building toward me. Things like that have an odd 3
sense of direction. I could watch them as they came, and jot down their 3
approximate route if they failed to form a continuous line. Even that would be a 3
great help. When I met any the pistol would make short work of them. 3
3
But I can hardly hope for as much as that. Now that these notes are made I shall 3
rest a while longer, and later will do some more groping. As soon as I get back to 3
the central chamber - which ought to be fairly easy - I shall try the extreme left- 3
hand opening. Perhaps I can get outside by dusk after all. 3
3
NIGHT - VI, 13 3
3
New trouble. My escape will be tremendously difficult, for there are elements I 3
had not suspected. Another night here in the mud, and a fight on my hands 3
tomorrow. I cut my rest short and was up and groping again by four o'clock. 3
After about fifteen minutes I reached the central chamber and moved my helmet 3
to mark the last of the three possible doorways. Starting through this opening, I 3
seemed to find the going more familiar, but was brought up short less than five 3
minutes by a sight that jolted me more than I can describe. 3
3
It was a group of four or five of those detestable man-lizards emerging from the 3
forest far off across the plain. I could not see them distinctly at that distance, but 3
thought they paused and turned toward the trees to gesticulate, after which they 3
were joined by fully a dozen more. The augmented party now began to advance 3
directly toward the invisible building, and as they approached I studied them 3
carefully. I had never before had a close view of the things outside the steamy 3
shadows of the jungle. 3
3
3
3
1243 3
3
3
3
The resemblance to reptiles was perceptible, though I knew it was only an 3
apparent one, since these beings have no point of contact with terrestrial life. 3
When they drew nearer they seemed less truly reptilian - only the flat head and 3
the green, slimy, frog-like skin carrying out the idea. They walked erect on their 3
odd, thick stumps, and their suction-discs made curious noises in the mud. These 3
were average specimens, about seven feet in height, and with four long, ropy 3
pectoral tentacles. The motions of those tentacles - if the theories of Fogg, Ekberg, 3
and Janat are right, which I formerly doubted but am now more ready to believe 3
- indicate that the things were in animated conversation. 3
3
I drew my flame pistol and was ready for a hard fight. The odds were bad, but 3
the weapon gave me a certain advantage. If the things knew this building they 3
would come through it after me, and in this way would form a key to getting 3
out; just as carnivorous skorahs might have done. That they would attack me 3
seemed certain; for even though they could not see the crystal in my pouch, they 3
could divine its presence through that special sense of theirs. 3
3
Yet, surprisingly enough, they did not attack me. Instead they scattered and 3
formed a vast circle around me - at a distance which indicated that they were 3
pressing close to the unseen wall. Standing there in a ring, the beings stared 3
silently and inquisitively at me, waving their tentacles and sometimes nodding 3
their heads and gesturing with their upper limbs. After a while I saw others issue 3
from the forest, and these advanced and joined the curious crowd. Those near 3
the corpse looked briefly at it but made no move to disturb it. It was a horrible 3
sight, yet the man-lizards seemed quite unconcerned. Now and then one of them 3
would brush away the farnoth-flies with its limbs or tentacles, or crush a 3
wriggling sificligh or akman, or an out-reaching efjeh-weed, with the suction 3
discs on its stumps. 3
3
Staring back at these grotesque and unexpected intruders, and wondering 3
uneasily why they did not attack me at once, I lost for the time being the will- 3
power and nervous energy to continue my search for a way out. Instead I leaned 3
limply against the invisible wall of the passage where I stood, letting my wonder 3
merge gradually into a chain of the wildest speculations. A hundred mysteries 3
which had previously baffled me seemed all at once to take on a new and sinister 3
significance, and I trembled with an acute fear unlike anything I had experienced 3
before. 3
3
I believed I knew why these repulsive beings were hovering expectantly around 3
me. I believed, too, that I had the secret of the transparent structure at last. The 3
alluring crystal which I had seized, the body of the man who had seized it before 3
me - all these things began to acquire a dark and threatening meaning. 3
3
3
3
1244 3
3
3
3
It was no common series of mischances which had made me lose my way in this 3
roofless, unseen tangle of corridors. Far from it. Beyond doubt, the place was a 3
genuine maze - a labyrinth deliberately built by these hellish things whose craft 3
and mentality I had so badly underestimated. Might I not have suspected this 3
before, knowing of their uncanny architectural skill? The purpose was all too 3
plain. It was a trap - a trap set to catch human beings, and with the crystal 3
spheroid as bait. These reptilian things, in their war on the takers of crystals, had 3
turned to strategy and were using our own cupidity against us. 3
3
Dwight - if this rotting corpse were indeed he - was a victim. He must have been 3
trapped some time ago, and had failed to find his way out. Lack of water had 3
doubtless maddened him, and perhaps he had run out of chlorate cubes as well. 3
Probably his mask had not slipped accidentally after all. Suicide was a likelier 3
thing. Rather than face a lingering death he had solved the issue by removing the 3
mask deliberately and letting the lethal atmosphere do its work at once. The 3
horrible irony of his fate lay in his position - only a few feet from the saving exit 3
he had failed to find. One minute more of searching and he would have been 3
safe. 3
3
And now I was trapped as he had been. Trapped, and with this circling herd of 3
curious starers to mock at my predicament. The thought was maddening, and as 3
it sank in I was seized with a sudden flash of panic which set me running 3
aimlessly through the unseen hallways. For several moments I was essentially a 3
maniac - stumbling, tripping, bruising myself on the invisible walls, and finally 3
collapsing in the mud as a panting, lacerated heap of mindless, bleeding flesh. 3
3
The fall sobered me a bit, so that when I slowly struggled to my feet I could 3
notice things and exercise my reason. The circling watchers were swaying their 3
tentacles in an odd, irregular way suggestive of sly, alien laughter, and I shook 3
my fist savagely at them as I rose. My gesture seemed to increase their hideous 3
mirth - a few of them clumsily imitating it with their greenish upper limbs. 3
Shamed into sense, I tried to collect my faculties and take stock of the situation. 3
3
After all, I was not as badly off as Dwight has been. Unlike him, I knew what the 3
situation was - and forewarned is forearmed. I had proof that the exit was 3
attainable in the end, and would not repeat his tragic act of impatient despair. 3
The body - or skeleton, as it would soon be - was constantly before me as a guide 3
to the sought-for aperture, and dogged patience would certainly take me to it if I 3
worked long and intelligently enough. 3
3
I had, however, the disadvantage of being surrounded by these reptilian devils. 3
Now that I realized the nature of the trap - whose invisible material argued a 3
science and technology beyond anything on earth - I could no longer discount 3
3
3
3
1245 3
3
3
3
the mentality and resources of my enemies. Even with my flame-pistol I would 3
have a bad time getting away - though boldness and quickness would doubtless 3
see me through in the long run. 3
3
But first I must reach the exterior - unless I could lure or provoke some of the 3
creatures to advance toward me. As I prepared my pistol for action and counted 3
over my generous supply of ammunition it occurred to me to try the effect of its 3
blasts on the invisible walls. Had I overlooked a feasible means of escape? There 3
was no clue to the chemical composition of the transparent barrier, and 3
conceivably it might be something which a tongue of fire could cut like cheese. 3
Choosing a section facing the corpse, I carefully discharged the pistol at close 3
range and felt with my knife where the blast had been aimed. Nothing was 3
changed. I had seen the flame spread when it struck the surface, and now I 3
realized that my hope had been vain. Only a long, tedious search for the exit 3
would ever bring me to the outside. 3
3
So, swallowing another food tablet and putting another cube in the elecrolyser of 3
my mask, I recommenced the long quest; retracing my steps to the central 3
chamber and starting out anew. I constantly consulted my notes and sketches, 3
and made fresh ones - taking one false turn after another, but staggering on in 3
desperation till the afternoon light grew very dim. As I persisted in my quest I 3
looked from time to time at the silent circle of mocking stares, and noticed a 3
gradual replacement in their ranks. Every now and then a few would return to 3
the forest, while others would arrive to take their places. The more I thought of 3
their tactics the less I liked them, for they gave me a hint of the creatures' 3
possible motives. At any time these devils could have advanced and fought me, 3
but they seemed to prefer watching my struggles to escape. I could not but infer 3
that they enjoyed the spectacle - and this made me shrink with double force from 3
the prospect of falling into their hands. 3
3
With the dark I ceased my searching, and sat down in the mud to rest. Now I am 3
writing in the light of my lamp, and will soon try to get some sleep. I hope 3
tomorrow will see me out; for my canteen is low, and lacol tablets are a poor 3
substitute for water. I would hardly dare to try the moisture in this slime, for 3
none of the water in the mud-regions is potable except when distilled. That is 3
why we run such long pipe lines to the yellow clay regions - or depend on rain- 3
water when those devils find and cut our pipes. I have none too many chlorate 3
cubes either, and must try to cut down my oxygen consumption as much as I 3
can. My tunnelling attempt of the early afternoon, and my later panic flight, 3
burned up a perilous amount of air. Tomorrow I will reduce physical exertion to 3
the barest minimum until I meet the reptiles and have to deal with them. I must 3
have a good cube supply for the journey back to Terra Nova. My enemies are still 3
3
3
3
1246 3
3
3
3
on hand; I can see a circle of their feeble glow-torches around me. There is a 3
horror about those lights which will keep me awake. 3
3
NIGHT - VI, 14 3
3
Another full day of searching and still no way out! I am beginning to be worried 3
about the water problem, for my canteen went dry at noon. In the afternoon 3
there was a burst of rain, and I went back to the central chamber for the helmet 3
which I had left as a marker - using this as a bowl and getting about two cupfuls 3
of water. I drank most of it, but have put the slight remainder in my canteen. 3
Lacol tablets make little headway against real thirst, and I hope there will be 3
more rain in the night. I am leaving my helmet bottom up to catch any that falls. 3
Food tablets are none too plentiful, but not dangerously low. I shall halve my 3
rations from now on. The chlorate cubes are my real worry, for even without 3
violent exercise the day's endless tramping burned a dangerous number. I feel 3
weak from my forced economies in oxygen, and from my constantly mounting 3
thirst. When I reduce my food I suppose I shall feel still weaker. 3
3
There is something damnable - something uncanny - about this labyrinth. I could 3
swear that I had eliminated certain turns through charting, and yet each new trial 3
belies some assumption I had thought established. Never before did I realize 3
how lost we are without visual landmarks. A blind man might do better - but for 3
most of us sight is the king of the senses. The effect of all these fruitless 3
wanderings is one of profound discouragement. I can understand how poor 3
Dwight must have felt. His corpse is now just a skeleton, and the sificlighs and 3
akmans and farnoth-flies are gone. The efjen-weeds are nipping the leather 3
clothing to pieces, for they were longer and faster-growing than I had expected. 3
And all the while those relays of tentacled starers stand gloatingly around the 3
barrier laughing at me and enjoying my misery. Another day and I shall go mad 3
if I do not drop dead from exhaustion. 3
3
However, there is nothing to do but persevere. Dwight would have got out if he 3
had kept on a minute longer. It is just possible that somebody from Terra Nova 3
will come looking for me before long, although this is only my third day out. My 3
muscles ache horribly, and I can't seem to rest at all lying down in this 3
loathesome mud. Last night, despite my terrific fatigue, I slept only fitfully, and 3
tonight I fear will be no better. I live in an endless nightmare - poised between 3
waking and sleeping, yet neither truly awake nor truly asleep. My hand shakes, I 3
can write no more for the time being. That circle of feeble glow-torches is 3
hideous. 3
3
LATE AFTERNOON - VI, 15 3
3
3
3
1247 3
3
3
3
Substantial progress! Looks good. Very weak, and did not sleep much till 3
daylight. Then I dozed till noon, though without being at all rested. No rain, and 3
thirst leaves me very weak. Ate an extra food tablet to keep me going, but 3
without water it didn't help much. I dared to try a little of the slime water just 3
once, but it made me violently sick and left me even thirstier than before. Must 3
save chlorate cubes, so am nearly suffocating for lack of oxygen. Can't walk 3
much of the time, but manage to crawl in the mud. About 2 P.M. I thought I 3
recognized some passages, and got substantially nearer to the corpse - or 3
skeleton - than I had been since the first day's trials. I was sidetracked once in a 3
blind alley, but recovered the main trail with the aid of my chart and notes. The 3
trouble with these jottings is that there are so many of them. They must cover 3
three feet of the record scroll, and I have to stop for long periods to untangle 3
them. 3
3
My head is weak from thirst, suffocation, and exhaustion, and I cannot 3
understand all I have set down. Those damnable green things keep staring and 3
laughing with their tentacles, and sometimes they gesticulate in a way that 3
makes me think they share some terrible joke just beyond my perception. 3
3
It was three o'clock when I really struck my stride. There was a doorway which, 3
according to my notes, I had not traversed before; and when I tried it I found I 3
could crawl circuitously toward the weed-twined skeleton. The route was a sort 3
of spiral, much like that by which I had first reached the central chamber. 3
3
Whenever I came to a lateral doorway or junction I would keep to the course 3
which seemed best to repeat that original journey. As I circled nearer and nearer 3
to my gruesome landmark, the watchers outside intensified their cryptic 3
gesticulations and sardonic silent laughter. Evidently they saw something grimly 3
amusing in my progress - perceiving no doubt how helpless I would be in any 3
encounter with them. I was content to leave them to their mirth; for although I 3
realized my extreme weakness, I counted on the flame pistol and its numerous 3
extra magazines to get me through the vile reptilian phalanx. 3
3
Hope now soared high, but I did not attempt to rise to my feet. Better crawl now, 3
and save my strength for the coming encounter with the man-lizards. My 3
advance was very slow, and the danger of straying into some blind alley very 3
great, but nonetheless I seemed to curve steadily toward my osseous goal. The 3
prospect gave me new strength, and for the nonce I ceased to worry about my 3
pain, my thirst, and my scant supply of cubes. The creatures were now all 3
massing around the entrance - gesturing, leaping, and laughing with their 3
tentacles. Soon, I reflected, I would have to face the entire horde - and perhaps 3
such reinforcements as they would receive from the forest. 3
3
3
3
1248 3
3
3
3
I am now only a few yards from the skeleton, and am pausing to make this entry 3
before emerging and breaking through the noxious band of entities. I feel 3
confident that with my last ounce of strength I can put them to flight despite 3
their numbers, for the range of this pistol is tremendous. Then a camp on the dry 3
moss at the plateau's edge, and in the morning a weary trip through the jungle to 3
Terra Nova. I shall be glad to see living men and the buildings of human beings 3
again. The teeth of that skull gleam and grin horribly. 3
3
TOWARD NIGHT - VI, I 5 3
3
Horror and despair. Baffled again! After making the previous entry I approached 3
still closer to the skeleton, but suddenly encountered an intervening wall. I had 3
been deceived once more, and was apparently back where I had been three days 3
before, on my first futile attempt to leave the labyrinth. Whether I screamed 3
aloud I do not know - perhaps I was too weak to utter a sound. I merely lay 3
dazed in the mud for a long period, while the greenish things outside leaped and 3
laughed and gestured. 3
3
After a time I became more fully conscious. My thirst and weakness and 3
suffocation were fast gaining on me, and with my last bit of strength I put a new 3
cube in the electrolyser - recklessly, and without regard for the needs of my 3
journey to Terra Nova. The fresh oxygen revived me slightly, and enabled me to 3
look about more alertly. 3
3
It seemed as if I were slightly more distant from poor Dwight than I had been at 3
that first disappointment, and I dully wondered if I could be in some other 3
corridor a trifle more remote. With this faint shadow of hope I laboriously 3
dragged myself forward - but after a few feet encountered a dead end as I had on 3
the former occasion. 3
3
This, then, was the end. Three days had taken me nowhere, and my strength was 3
gone. I would soon go mad from thirst, and I could no longer count on cubes 3
enough to get me back. I feebly wondered why the nightmare things had 3
gathered so thickly around the entrance as they mocked me. Probably this was 3
part of the mockery - to make me think I was approaching an egress which they 3
knew did not exist. 3
3
I shall not last long, though I am resolved not to hasten matters as Dwight did. 3
His grinning skull has just turned toward me, shifted by the groping of one of 3
the efjeh-weeds that are devouring his leather suit. The ghoulish stare of those 3
empty eye-sockets is worse than the staring of those lizard horrors. It lends a 3
hideous meaning to that dead, white-toothed grin. 3
3
3
3
1249 3
3
3
3
I shall lie very still in the mud and save all the strength I can. This record - which 3
I hope may reach and warn those who come after me - will soon be done. After I 3
stop writing I shall rest a long while. Then, when it is too dark for those frightful 3
creatures to see, I shall muster up my last reserves of strength and try to toss the 3
record scroll over the wall and the intervening corridor to the plain outside. I 3
shall take care to send it toward the left, where it will not hit the leaping band of 3
mocking beleaguers. Perhaps it will be lost forever in the thin mud - but perhaps 3
it will land in some widespread clump of weeds and ultimately reach the hands 3
of men. 3
3
If it does survive to be read, I hope it may do more than merely warn men of this 3
trap. I hope it may teach our race to let those shining crystals stay where they 3
are. They belong to Venus alone. Our planet does not truly need them, and I 3
believe we have violated some obscure and mysterious law - some law buried 3
deep in the arcane of the cosmos - in our attempts to take them. Who can tell 3
what dark, potent, and widespread forces spur on these reptilian things who 3
guard their treasure so strangely? Dwight and I have paid, as others have paid 3
and will pay. But it may be that these scattered deaths are only the prelude of 3
greater horrors to come. Let us leave to Venus that which belongs only to Venus. 3
3
I am very near death now, and fear I may not be able to throw the scroll when 3
dusk comes. If I cannot, I suppose the man-lizards will seize it, for they will 3
probably realize what it is. They will not wish anyone to be warned of the 3
labyrinth - and they will not know that my message holds a plea in their own 3
behalf. As the end approaches I feel more kindly towards the things. In the scale 3
of cosmic entity who can say which species stands higher, or more nearly 3
approaches a space-wide organic norm - theirs or mine? 3
3
I have just taken the great crystal out of my pouch to look at in my last moments. 3
It shines fiercely and menacingly in the red rays of the dying day. The leaping 3
horde have noticed it, and their gestures have changed in a way I cannot 3
understand. I wonder why they keep clustered around the entrance instead of 3
concentrating at a still closer point in the transparent wall. 3
3
I am growing numb and cannot write much more. Things whirl around me, yet I 3
do not lose consciousness. Can I throw this over the wall? That crystal glows so, 3
yet the twilight is deepening. 3
3
Dark. Very weak. They are still laughing and leaping around the doorway, and 3
have started those hellish glow-torches. 3
3
Are they going away? I dreamed I heard a sound. . . light in the sky. 3

REPORT OF WESLEY P. MILLER, SUPT. GROUP A, VENUS CRYSTAL CO. 3
3
(TERRA NOVA ON VENUS - VI, 16) 3
3
Our Operative A-49, Kenton J. Stanfield of 5317 Marshall Street, Richmond, Va., 3
left Terra Nova early on VI, 12, for a short-term trip indicated by detector. Due 3
back 13th or 14th. Did not appear by evening of 15th, so Scouting Plane FR-58 3
with five men under my command set out at 8 P.M. to follow route with detector. 3
Needle showed no change from earlier readings. 3
3
Followed needle to Erycinian Highland, played strong searchlights all the way. 3
Triple-range flame-guns and D-radiation cylinders could have dispersed any 3
ordinary hostile force of natives, or any dangerous aggregation of carnivorous 3
skorahs. 3
3
When over the open plain on Eryx we saw a group of moving lights which we 3
knew were native glow- torches. As we approached, they scattered into the 3
forest. Probably seventy-five to a hundred in all. Detector indicated crystal on 3
spot where they had been. Sailing low over this spot, our lights picked out 3
objects on the ground. Skeleton tangled in efjeh-weeds, and complete body ten 3
feet from it. Brought plane down near bodies, and corner of wing crashed on 3
unseen obstruction. 3
3
Approaching bodies on foot, we came up short against a smooth, invisible 3
barrier which puzzled us enormously. Feeling along it near the skeleton, we 3
struck an opening, beyond which was a space with another opening leading to 3
the skeleton. The latter, though robbed of clothing by weeds, had one of the 3
company's numbered metal helmets beside it. It was Operative B-9, Frederick N. 3
Dwight of Koenig's division, who had been out of Terra Nova for two months on 3
a long commission. 3
3
Between this skeleton and the complete body there seemed to be another wall, 3
but we could easily identify the second man as Stanfield. He had a record scroll 3
in his left hand and a pen in his right, and seemed to have been writing when he 3
died. No crystal was visible, but the detector indicated a huge specimen near 3
Stanfield's body. 3
3
We had great difficulty in getting at Stanfield, but finally succeeded. The body 3
was still warm, and a great crystal lay beside it, covered by the shallow mud. We 3
at once studied the record scroll in the left hand, and prepared to take certain 3
steps based on its data. The contents of the scroll forms the long narrative 3
prefixed to this report; a narrative whose main descriptions we have verified, 3
and which we append as an explanation of what was found. The later parts of 3
3
3
3
1251 3
3
3
3
this account show mental decay, but there is no reason to doubt the bulk of it. 3
Stanfield obviously died of a combination of thirst, suffocation, cardiac strain, 3
and psychological depression. His mask was in place, and freely generating 3
oxygen despite an alarmingly low cube supply. 3
3
Our plane being damaged, we sent a wireless and called out Anderson with 3
Repair Plane PG-7, a crew of wreckers, and a set of blasting materials. By 3
morning FH-58 was fixed, and went back under Anderson carrying the two 3
bodies and the crystal. We shall bury Dwight and Stanfield in the company 3
graveyard, and ship the crystal to Chicago on the next earth-bound liner. Later, 3
we shall adopt Stanfield's suggestion - the sound one in the saner, earlier part of 3
his report - and bring across enough troops to wipe out the natives altogether. 3
With a clear field, there can be scarcely any limit to the amount of crystal we can 3
secure. 3
3
In the afternoon we studied the invisible building or trap with great care, 3
exploring it with the aid of long guiding cords, and preparing a complete chart 3
for our archives. We were much impressed by the design, and shall keep 3
specimens of the substance for chemical analysis. All such knowledge will be 3
useful when we take over the various cities of the natives. Our type C diamond 3
drills were able to bite into the unseen material, and wreckers are now planting 3
dynamite preparatory to a thorough blasting. Nothing will be left when we are 3
done. The edifice forms a distinct menace to aerial and other possible traffic. 3

In considering the plan of the labyrinth one is impressed not only with the irony 3
of Dwight's fate, but with that of Stanfield as well. When trying to reach the 3
second body from the skeleton, we could find no access on the right, but 3
Markheim found a doorway from the first inner space some fifteen feet past 3
Dwight and four or five past Stanfield. Beyond this was a long hall which we did 3
not explore till later, but on the right-hand side of that hall was another doorway 3
leading directly to the body. Stanfield could have reached the outside entrance 3
by walking twenty-two or twenty-three feet if he had found the opening which 3
lay directly behind him - an opening which he overlooked in his exhaustion and 3
despair. 3

3
To those who look beneath the surface, the present universal war drives home 3
more than one anthropological truth in striking fashion; and of the verities none 3
is more profound than that relating to the essential immutability of mankind and 3
its instincts. 3
3
Four years ago a large part of the civilised world laboured under certain 3
biological fallacies which may, in a sense, be held responsible for the extent and 3
duration of the present conflict. These fallacies, which were the foundation of 3
pacifism and other pernicious forms of social and political radicalism, dealt with 3
the capacity of man to evolve mentally beyond his former state of subservience 3
to primate instinct and pugnacity, and to conduct his affairs and international or 3
interracial relations on a basis of reason and good-will. That belief in such 3
capability is unscientific and childishly naive, is beside the question. The fact 3
remains, that the most civilised part of the world, including our own Anglo- 3
Saxondom, did entertain enough of these notions to relax military vigilance, lay 3
stress on points of honour, place trust in treaties, and permit a powerful and 3
unscrupulous nation to indulge unchecked and unsuspected in nearly fifty years 3
of preparation for world-wide robbery and slaughter. We are reaping the result 3
of our simplicity. 3
3
The past is over. Our former follies we can but regret, and expiate as best we may 3
by a crusade to the death against the Trans-Rhenane monster which we allowed 3
to grow and flourish beneath our very eyes. But the future holds more of 3
responsibility, and we must prepare to guard against any renascence of the 3
benevolent delusions that four years of blood have barely been able to discard 3
forever the sentimental standpoint, and to view our species through the cold 3
eyes of science alone. We must recognise the essential underlaying savagery in 3
the animal called man, and return to older and sounder principles of national life 3
and defense. We must realise that man's nature will remain the same so long as 3
he remains man; that civilisation is but a slight coverlet beneath which the 3
dominant beast sleeps lightly and ever ready to awake. To preserve civilisation, 3
we must deal scientifically with the brute element, using only genuine biological 3
principles. In considering ourselves, we think too much of ethics and sociology - 3
too little of plain natural history. We should perceive that man's period of 3
historical existence, a period so short that his physical constitution has not been 3
altered in the slightest degree, is insufficient to allow of any considerable mental 3
change. The instincts that governed the Egyptians and the Assyrians of old, 3
govern us as well; and as the ancients thought, grasped, struggled, and deceived. 3
3
3
3
1253 3
3
3
3
so shall we moderns continue to think, grasp, struggle, and deceive in our inmost 3
hearts. Change is only superficial and apparent. 3
3
Man's respect for the imponderables varies according to his mental constitution 3
and environment. Through certain modes of thought and training it can be 3
elevated tremendously, yet there is always a limit. The man or nation of high 3
culture may acknowledge to great lengths the restraints imposed by conventions 3
and honour, but beyond a certain point primitive will or desire cannot be curbed. 3
Denied anything ardently desired, the individual or state will argue and parley 3
just so long - then, if the impelling motive be sufficiently great, will cast aside 3
every rule and break down every acquired inhibition, plunging viciously after 3
the object wished; all the more fantastically savage because of previous 3
repression. The sole ultimate factor in human decisions is physical force. This we 3
must learn, however repugnant the idea may seem, if we are to protect ourselves 3
and our institutions. Reliance on anything else is fallacious and ruinous. 3
Dangerous beyond description are the voices sometimes heard today, decrying 3
the continuance of armament after the close of the present hostilities. 3
3
The specific application of the scientific truth regarding man's native instincts 3
will be found in the adoption of a post-bellum international programme. 3
Obviously, we must take into account the primordial substructure and arrange 3
for the upholding of culture by methods which will stand the acid test of stress 3
and conflicting ambitions. In disillusioned diplomacy, ample armament, and 3
universal military training alone will be found the solution of the world's 3
difficulties. It will not be a perfect solution, because humanity is not perfect. It 3
will not abolish war, because war is the expression of a natural human tendency. 3
But it will at least produce an approximate stability of social and political 3
conditions, and prevent the menace of the entire world by the greed of any one 3
of its constituent parts. 3

Cats And Dogs 3

3
Being told of the cat-and-dog fight about to occur in your literary club, I cannot 3
resist contributing a few Thomastic yowls and sibilants upon my side of the 3
dispute, though conscious that the word of a venerable ex-member can scarcely 3
have much weight against the brilliancy of such still active adherents as may 3
bark upon the other side. Aware of my ineptitude at argument, a valued 3
correspondent has supplied me with the records of a similar controversy in the 3
New York Tribune, in which Mr. Carl van Doran is on my side and Mr. Albert 3
Payson Terhune on that of the canine tribe. From this I would be glad to 3
plagiarise such data as I need; but my friend, with genuinely Machiavellian 3
subtlety, has furnished me with only a part of the feline section whilst submitting 3
the doggish brief in full. No doubt he imagines that this arrangement, in view of 3
my own emphatic bias, makes for something like ultimate fairness; but for me it 3
is exceedingly inconvenient, since it will force me to be more or less original in 3
several parts of the ensuing remarks. 3
3
Between dogs and cats my degree of choice is so great that it would never occur 3
to me to compare the two. I have no active dislike for dogs, any more than I have 3
for monkeys, human beings, tradesmen, cows, sheep, or pterodactyls; but for the 3
cat I have entertained a particular respect and affection ever since the earliest 3
days of my infancy. In its flawless grace and superior self-sufficiency I have seen 3
a symbol of the perfect beauty and bland impersonality of the universe itself, 3
objectively considered, and in its air of silent mystery there resides for me all the 3
wonder and fascination of the unknown. The dog appeals to cheap and facile 3
emotions; the cat to the deepest founts of imagination and cosmic perception in 3
the human mind. It is no accident that the contemplative Egyptians, together 3
with such later poetic spirits as Poe, Gautier, Baudelaire and Swinburne, were all 3
sincere worshippers of the supple grimalkin. 3
3
Naturally, one's preference in the matter of cats and dogs depends wholly upon 3
one's temperament and point of view. The dog would appear to me to be the 3
favorite of superficial, sentimental, and emotional people — people who feel 3
rather than think, who attach importance to mankind and the popular 3
conventional emotions of the simple, and who find their greatest consolation in 3
the fawning and dependent attachments of a gregarious society. Such people live 3
3
3
3
1255 3
3
3
3
in a limited world of imagination; accepting uncritically the values of common 3
folklore, and always preferring to have their naive beliefs, feelings, and 3
prejudices tickled, rather than to enjoy a purely aesthetic and philosophic 3
pleasure arising from discrimination, contemplation, and the recognition of 3
austere, absolute beauty. This is not to say that the cheaper elements do not also 3
reside in the average cat-lover's love of cats, but merely to point out that in 3
ailurophily there exists a basis of true aestheticism which kynophily does not 3
possess. The real lover of cats is one who demands a clearer adjustment to the 3
universe than ordinary household platitudes provide; one who refuses to 3
swallow the sentimental notion that all good people love dogs, children, and 3
horses while all bad people dislike and are disliked by such. He is unwilling to 3
set up himself and his cruder feelings as a measure of universal values, or to 3
allow shallow ethical notions to warp his judgment. In a word, he had rather 3
admire and respect than effuse and dote; and does not fall into the fallacy that 3
pointless sociability and friendliness, or slavering devotion and obedience, 3
constitute anything intrinsically admirable or exalted. Dog-lovers base their 3
whole case on these commonplace, servile, and plebeian qualities, and amusingly 3
judge the intelligence of a pet by its degree of conformity to their own wishes. 3
Cat-lovers escape this delusion, repudiate the idea that cringing subservience 3
and sidling companionship to man are supreme merits, and stand free to 3
worship aristocratic independence, self-respect, and individual personality 3
joined to extreme grace and beauty as typified by the cool, lithe, cynical and 3
unconquered lord of the housetops. 3
3
Persons of commonplace ideas — unimaginative worthy burghers who are 3
satisfied with the daily round of things and who subscribe to the popular credo 3
of sentimental values — will always be dog-lovers. To them nothing will ever be 3
more important than themselves and their own primitive feelings, and they will 3
never cease to esteem and glorify the fellow-animal who best typifies these. Such 3
persons are submerged in the vortex of Oriental idealism and abasement which 3
ruined classic civilisation in the Dark Ages, and live in a bleak world of abstract 3
sentimental values wherein the mawkish illusions of meekness, gentleness, 3
brotherhood, and whining humility are magnified into supreme virtues, and a 3
whole false ethic and philosophy erected on the timid reactions of the flexor 3
system of muscles. This heritage, ironically foisted on us when Roman politics 3
raised the faith of a whipped and broken people to supremacy in the later 3
empire, has naturally kept a strong hold over the weak and sentimentally 3
thoughtless; and perhaps reached its culmination in the insipid nineteenth 3
century, when people were wont to praise dogs "because they are so human" (as 3
if humanity were any valid standard of merit!), and honest Edwin Landseer 3
painted hundreds of smug Fidoes and Carlos and Rovers with all the anthropoid 3
triviality, pettiness, and "cuteness" of eminent Victorians. 3
3
3
3
1256 3
3
3
3
But amidst this chaos of intellectual and emotional groveling a few free souls 3
have always stood out for the old civilised realities which mediaevalism eclipsed 3
3
— the stern classic loyalty to truth, strength, and beauty given a clear mind and 3
uncowed spirit to the full-living Western Aryan confronted by Nature's majesty, 3
loveliness, and aloofness. This is the virile aesthetic and ethic of the extensor 3
muscles — the bold, buoyant, assertive beliefs and preferences of proud, 3
dominant, unbroken and unterrified conquerors, hunters, and warriors — and it 3
has small use for the shams and whimperings of the brotherly, affection- 3
slobbering peacemaker and cringer and sentimentalist. Beauty and sufficiency — 3
twin qualities of the cosmos itself — are the gods of this unshackled and pagan 3
type; to the worshipper of such eternal things the supreme virtue will not be 3
found in lowliness, attachment, obedience, and emotional messiness. This sort of 3
worshipper will look for that which best embodies the loveliness of the stars and 3
the worlds and the forests and the seas and the sunsets, and which best acts out 3
the blandness, lordliness, accuracy, self-sufficiency, cruelty, independence, and 3
contemptuous and capricious impersonality of the all governing Nature. Beauty 3
3
— coolness — aloofness — philosophic repose — self-sufficiency — untamed 3
mastery — where else can we find these things incarnated with even half the 3
perfection and completeness that mark their incarnation in the peerless and 3
softly gliding cat, which performs its mysterious orbit with the relentless and 3
obtrusive certainty of a planet in infinity? 3
3
That dogs are dear to the unimaginative peasant-burgher whilst cats appeal to 3
the sensitive poet-aristocrat-philosopher will be clear in a moment when we 3
reflect on the matter of biological association. Practical plebeian folk judge a 3
thing only by its immediate touch, taste, and smell; while more delicate types 3
form their estimates from the linked images and ideas which the object calls up 3
in their minds. Now when dogs and cats are considered, the stolid churl sees 3
only the two animals before him, and bases his favour on their relative capacity 3
to pander to his sloppy, uniformed ideas of ethics and friendship and flattering 3
subservience. On the other hand the gentleman and thinker sees each in all its 3
natural affiliations, and cannot fail to notice that in the great symmetries of 3
organic life dogs fall in with slovenly wolves and foxes and jackals and coyotes 3
and dingoes and painted hyaenas, whilst cats walk proudly with the jungle's 3
lords, and own the haughty lion, the sinuous leopard, the regal tiger, and the 3
shapely panther and jaguar as their kin. Dogs are the hieroglyphs of blind 3
emotion, inferiority, servile attachment, and gregariousness — the attributes of 3
commonplace, stupidly passionate, and intellectually and imaginatively 3
underdeveloped men. Cats are the runes of beauty, invincibility, wonder, pride, 3
freedom, coldness, self-sufficiency, and dainty individuality — the qualities of 3
sensitive, enlightened, mentally developed, pagan, cynical, poetic, philosophic, 3
dispassionate, reserved, independent, Nietzschean, unbroken, civilised, master- 3
class men. The dog is a peasant and the cat is a gentleman. 3

We may, indeed, judge the tone and bias of a civilisation by its relative attitude 3
toward dogs and cats. The proud Egypt wherein Pharaoh was Pharaoh and 3
pyramids rose in beauty at the wish of him who dreamed them bowed down to 3
the cat, and temples were built to its goddess at Bubastis. In imperial Rome the 3
graceful leopard adorned most homes of quality, lounging in insolent beauty in 3
the atrium with golden collar and chain; while after the age of the Antonines the 3
actual cat was imported from Egypt and cherished as a rare and costly luxury. So 3
much for the dominant and enlightened peoples. When, however, we come to 3
the groveling Middle Ages with their superstitions and ecstasies and 3
monasticisms and maunderings over saints and their relics, we find the cool and 3
impersonal loveliness of the felidae in very low esteem; and behold a sorry 3
spectacle of hatred and cruelty shown toward the beautiful little creature whose 3
mousing virtues alone gained it sufferance amongst the ignorant churls who 3
resented its self-respecting coolness and feared its cryptical and elusive 3
independence as something akin to the dark powers of witchcraft. These boorish 3
slaves of eastern darkness could not tolerate what did not serve their own cheap 3
emotions and flimsy purposes. They wished a dog to fawn and hunt and fetch 3
and carry, and had no use for the cat's gift of eternal disinterested beauty to feed 3
the spirit. One can imagine how they must have resented Pussy's magnificent 3
reposefulness, unhurriedness, relaxation, and scorn for trivial human aims and 3
concernments. Throw a stick, and the servile dog wheezes and pants and 3
stumbles to bring it to you. Do the same before a cat, and he will eye you with 3
coolly polite and somewhat bored amusement. And just as inferior people prefer 3
the inferior animal which scampers excitedly because someone else wants 3
something, so do superior people respect the superior animal which lives its own 3
life and knows that the puerile stick-throwings of alien bipeds are none of its 3
business and beneath its notice. The dog barks and begs and tumbles to amuse 3
you when you crack the whip. That pleases a meekness-loving peasant who 3
relishes a stimulus to his self importance. The cat, on the other hand, charms you 3
into playing for its benefit when it wishes to be amused; making you rush about 3
the room with a paper on a string when it feels like exercise, but refusing all your 3
attempts to make it play when it is not in the humour. That is personality and 3
individuality and self-respect — the calm mastery of a being whose life is its own 3
and not yours — and the superior person recognises and appreciates this because 3
he too is a free soul whose position is assured, and whose only law is his own 3
heritage and aesthetic sense. Altogether, we may see that the dog appeals to 3
those primitive emotional souls whose chief demands on the universe are for 3
meaningless affection, aimless companionship, and flattering attention and 3
subservience; whilst the cat reigns among those more contemplative and 3
imaginative spirits who ask of the universe only the objective sight of poignant, 3
ethereal beauty and the animate symbolisation of Nature's bland, relentless, 3
reposeful, unhurried and impersonal order and sufficiency. The dog gives, but 3
the cat is. 3

Simple folk always overstress the ethical element in life, and it is quite natural 3
that they should extend it to the realm of their pets. Accordingly, we hear many 3
inane dicta in favour of dogs on the ground that they are faithful, whilst cats are 3
treacherous. Now just what does this really mean? Where are the points of 3
reference? Certainly, the dog has so little imagination and individuality that it 3
knows no motives but its master's; but what sophisticated mind can descry a 3
positive virtue in this stupid abnegation of its birthright? Discrimination must 3
surely award the palm to the superior cat, which has too much natural dignity to 3
accept any scheme of things but its own, and which consequently cares not one 3
whit what any clumsy human thinks or wishes or expects of it. It is not 3
treacherous, because it has never acknowledged any allegiance to anything 3
outside its own leisurely wishes; and treachery basically implies a departure 3
from some covenant explicitly recognised. The cat is a realist, and no hypocrite. 3
He takes what pleases him when he wants it, and gives no promises. He never 3
leads you to expect more from him than he gives, and if you choose to be 3
stupidly Victorian enough to mistake his purrs and rubbings of self-satisfaction 3
for marks of transient affection toward you, that is no fault of his. He would not 3
for a moment have you believe that he wants more of you than food and warmth 3
and shelter and amusement — and he is certainly justified in criticising your 3
aesthetic and imaginative development if you fail to find his grace, beauty, and 3
cheerful decorative influence an aboundingly sufficient repayment for all you 3
give him. The cat-lover need not be amazed at another's love for dogs — indeed, 3
he may also possess this quality himself; for dogs are often very comely, and as 3
lovable in a condescending way as a faithful old servant or tenant in the eyes of a 3
master — but he cannot help feeling astonished at those who do not share his 3
love for cats. The cat is such a perfect symbol of beauty and superiority that it 3
seems scarcely possible for any true aesthete and civilised cynic to do other than 3
worship it. We call ourselves a dog's "master" — but who ever dared call himself 3
the "master" of a cat? We own a dog — he is with us as a slave and inferior 3
because we wish him to be. But we entertain a cat — he adorns our hearth as a 3
guest, fellow-lodger, and equal because he wishes to be there. It is no 3
compliment to be the stupidly idolised master of a dog whose instinct it is to 3
idolise, but it is a very distinct tribute to be chosen as the friend and confidant of 3
a philosophic cat who is wholly his own master and could easily choose another 3
companion if he found such a one more agreeable and interesting. A trace, I 3
think, of this great truth regarding the higher dignity of the cat has crept into 3
folklore in the use of the names "cat" and "dog" as terms of opprobrium. Whilst 3
"cat" has never been applied to any sort of offender more than the mildly 3
spiteful and innocuously sly female gossip and commentator, the words "dog" 3
and "cur" have always been linked with vileness, dishonor, and degradation of 3
the gravest type. In the crystallisation of this nomenclature there has 3
undoubtedly been present in the popular mind some dim, half-unconscious 3
realisation that there are depths of slinking, whining, fawning, and servile 3
3
3
3
1259 3
3
3
3
ignobility which no kith of the hon and the leopard could ever attain. The cat 3
may fall low, but he is always unbroken. He is, like the Nordic among men, one 3
of those who govern their own lives or die. 3
3
We have but to glance analytically at the two animals to see the points pile up in 3
favour of the cat. Beauty, which is probably the only thing of any basic 3
significance in all the cosmos, ought to be our chief criterion; and here the cat 3
excels so brilliantly that all comparisons collapse. Some dogs, it is true, have 3
beauty in a very ample degree; but even the highest level of canine beauty falls 3
far below the feline average. The cat is classic whilst the dog is Gothic — 3
nowhere in the animal world can we discover such really Hellenic perfection of 3
form, with anatomy adapted to function, as in the felidae. Puss is a Doric temple 3
— an Ionic colonnade — in the utter classicism of its structural and decorative 3
harmonies. And this is just as true kinetically as statically, for art has no parallel 3
for the bewitching grace of the cat's slightest motion. The sheer, perfect 3
aestheticism of kitty's lazy stretchings, industrious face-washings, playful 3
rollings, and little involuntary shiftings in sleep is something as keen and vital as 3
the best pastoral poetry or genre painting; whilst the unerring accuracy of his 3
leaping and springing, running and hunting, has an art-value just as high in a 3
more spirited way but it is his capacity for leisure and repose which makes the 3
cat preeminent. Mr. Carl Van Vechten, in "Peter Whiffle," holds up the timeless 3
restfulness of the cat as a model for life's philosophy, and Prof. William Lyon 3
Phelps has very effectively captured the secret of felinity when he says that the 3
cat does not merely lie down, but "pours his body out on the floor like a glass of 3
water". What other creature has thus merged the aestheticism of mechanics and 3
hydraulics? Contrast this with the inept panting, wheezing, fumbling, drooling, 3
scratching, and general clumsiness of the average dog with his false and wasted 3
motions. And in the details of neatness the fastidious cat is of course 3
immeasurably ahead. We always love to touch a cat, but only the insensitive can 3
uniformly welcome the frantic and humid nuzzlings and pawings of a dusty and 3
perhaps not inodorous canine which leaps and fusses and writhes about in 3
awkward feverishness for no particular reason save that blind nerve-centres have 3
been spurred by certain meaningless stimuli. There is a wearying excess of bad 3
manners in all this doggish fury — well-bred people don't paw and maul one, 3
and surely enough we invariably find the cat gentle and reserved in his 3
advances, and delicate even when he glides gracefully into your lap with 3
cultivated purrs, or leaps whimsical on the table where you are writing to play 3
with your pen in modulated, seriocomic pats. I do not wonder that Mahomet, 3
that sheik of perfect manners, loved cats for their urbanity and disliked dogs for 3
their boorishness; or that cats are the favorites in the polite Latin countries whilst 3
dogs take the lead in heavy, practical, and beer-drinking Central Europe. Watch 3
a cat eat, and then watch a dog. The one is held in check by an inherent and 3
inescapable daintiness, and lends a kind of grace to one of the most ungraceful of 3
3
3
3

3
3
3
all processes. The dog, on the other hand, is wholly repulsive in his bestial and 3
insatiate greediness; living up to his forest kinship of "wolfing" most openly and 3
unashamedly. Returning to beauty of line — is it not significant that while many 3
normal breeds of dogs are conspicuously and admittedly ugly, no healthy and 3
well-developed feline of any species whatsoever is other than beautiful? There 3
are, of course, many ugly cats; but these are always individual cases of 3
mongrelism, malnutrition, deformity, or injury. No breed of cats in its proper 3
condition can by any stretch of the imagination be thought of as even slightly 3
ungraceful — a record against which must be pitted the depressing spectacle of 3
impossibly flattened bulldogs, grotesquely elongated dachshunds, hideously 3
shapeless and shaggy Airedales, and the like. Of course, it may be said that no 3
aesthetic standard is other than relative — but we always work with such 3
standards as we empirically have, and in comparing cats and dogs under the 3
Western European aesthetic we cannot be unfair to either. If any undiscovered 3
tribe in Tibet finds Airedales beautiful and Persian cats ugly, we will not dispute 3
them on their own territory — but just now we are dealing with ourselves and 3
our territory, and here the verdict would not admit of much doubt even from the 3
most ardent kynophile. Such an one usually passes the problem off in an 3
epigrammatic paradox, and says that "Snookums is so homely, he's pretty!" This 3
is the childish penchant for the grotesque and tawdrily "cute" which we see 3
likewise embodied in popular cartoons, freak dolls, and all the malformed 3
decorative trumpery of the "Billikin" or "Krazy Kat" order found in the "dens" 3
and "cosy corners" of the would-be-sophisticated yokelry. 3
3
In the matter of intelligence we find the caninites making amusing claims — 3
amusing because they so naively measure what they conceive to be an animal's 3
intelligence by its degree of subservience to the human will. A dog will retrieve, 3
a cat will not; therefore (sic!) the dog is the more intelligent. Dogs can be more 3
elaborately trained for the circus and vaudeville acts than cats, therefore (O Zeus, 3
O Royal Mount!) they are cerebrally superior. Now of course this is all the 3
sheerest nonsense. We would not call a weak-spirited man more intelligent than 3
an independent citizen because we can make him vote as we wish whereas we 3
can't influence the independent citizen, yet countless persons apply an exactly 3
parallel argument in appraising the grey matter of dogs and cats. Competition in 3
servility is something to which no self-respecting Thomas or Tabitha ever 3
stooped, and it is plain that any really effective estimate of canine and feline 3
intelligence must proceed from a careful observation of dogs and cats in a 3
detached state — uninfluenced by human beings — as they formulate certain 3
objectives of their own and use their own mental equipment in achieving them. 3
When we do this, we arrive at a very wholesome respect for our purring 3
hearthside friend who makes so little display about his wishes and business 3
methods; for in every conception and calculation he shows a steel-cold and 3
deliberate union of intellect, will, and sense of proportion which puts utterly to 3
3
3
3
1261 3
3
3
3
shame the emotional sloppings-over and docilely acquired artificial tricks of the 3
"clever" and "faithful" pointer or sheep-dog. Watch a cat decide to move 3
through a door, and see how patiently he waits for his opportunity, never losing 3
sight of his purpose even when he finds it expedient to feign other interests in 3
the interim. Watch him in the thick of the chase, and compare his calculating 3
patience and quiet study of his terrain with the noisy floundering and pawing of 3
his canine rival. It is not often that he returns empty-handed. He knows what he 3
wants, and means to get it in the most effective way, even at the sacrifice of time 3
— which he philosophically recognises as unimportant in the aimless cosmos. 3
There is no turning him aside or distracting his attention — and we know that 3
among humans this is the quality of mental tenacity, this ability to carry a single 3
thread through complex distractions, is considered a pretty good sign of 3
intellectual vigour and maturity. Children, old crones, peasants, and dogs 3
ramble, cats and philosophers stick to their point. In resourcefulness, too, the cat 3
attests his superiority. Dogs can be well trained to do a single thing, but 3
psychologists tell us that these responses to an automatic memory instilled from 3
outside are of little worth as indices of real intelligence. To judge the abstract 3
development of a brain, confront it with new and unfamiliar conditions and see 3
how well its own strength enables it to achieve its object by sheer reasoning 3
without blazed trails. Here the cats can silently devise a dozen mysterious and 3
successful alternatives whilst poor Fido is barking in bewilderment and 3
wondering what it is all about. Granted that Rover the retriever may make a 3
greater bid for popular sentimental regard by going into the burning house and 3
saving the baby in traditional cinema fashion, it remains a fact that whiskered 3
and purring Nig is a higher-grade biological organism — something 3
physiologically and psychologically nearer a man because of his very freedom 3
from man's orders, and as such entitled to a higher respect from those who judge 3
by purely philosophic and aesthetic standards. We can respect a cat as we cannot 3
respect a dog, no matter which personally appeals the more to our mere doting 3
fancy; and if we be aesthetes and analysts rather than commonplace-lovers and 3
emotionalists, the scales must inevitably turn completely in kitty's favour. 3
3
It may be added, moreover, that even the aloof and sufficient cat is by no means 3
devoid of sentimental appeal. Once we get rid of the uncivilised ethical bias — 3
the "treacherous" and "horrid bird-catcher" prejudice — we find in the 3
"harmless cat" the very apex of happy domestic symbolism; whilst small kittens 3
become objects to adore, idealise, and celebrate in the most rhapsodic of dactyls 3
and anapaests, iambics and trochaics. I, in my own senescent mellowness, 3
confess to an inordinate and wholly unphilosophic predilection for tiny coal- 3
black kittens with large yellow eyes, and could no more pass one without petting 3
him than Dr. Johnson could pass a sidewalk post without striking it. There is, 3
likewise, in many cats quite analogous to the reciprocal fondness so loudly 3
extolled in dogs, human beings, horses, and the like. Cats come to associate 3
3
3
3

3
3
3
certain persons with acts continuously contributing to their pleasure, and acquire 3
for them a recognition and attachment which manifests itself in pleasant 3
excitement at their approach — whether or not bearing food and drink — and a 3
certain pensiveness at their protracted absence. A cat with whom I was on 3
intimate terms reached the point of accepting food from no hand but one, and 3
would actually go hungry rather than touch the least morsel from a kindly 3
neighbour source. He also had distinct affections amongst the other cats of that 3
idyllic household; voluntarily offering food to one of his whiskered friends, 3
whilst disputing most savagely the least glance which his coal-black rival 3
"Snowball" would bestow upon his plate. If it be argued that these feline 3
fondnesses are essentially "selfish" and "practical" in their ultimate composition, 3
let us inquire in return how many human fondnesses, apart from those springing 3
directly upon primitive brute instinct, have any other basis. After the returning 3
board has brought in the grand total of zero we shall be better able to refrain 3
from ingenuous censure of the "selfish" cat. 3
3
The superior imaginative inner life of the cat, resulting in superior self- 3
possession, is well known. A dog is a pitiful thing, depending wholly on 3
companionship, and utterly lost except in packs or by the side of his master. 3
Leave him alone and he does not know what to do except bark and howl and trot 3
about till sheer exhaustion forces him to sleep. A cat, however, is never without 3
the potentialities of contentment. Like a superior man, he knows how to be alone 3
and happy. Once he looks about and finds no one to amuse him, he settles down 3
to the task of amusing himself; and no one really knows cats without having 3
occasionally peeked stealthily at some lively and well-balanced kitten which 3
believes itself to be alone. Only after such a glimpse of unaffected tail-chasing 3
grace and unstudied purring can one fully understand the charm of those lines 3
which Coleridge wrote with reference to the human rather than the feline young 3
— page eleven 3
3
".... a limber elf. 3
3
Singing, dancing to itself." 3
3
But whole volumes could be written on the playing of cats, since the varieties 3
and aesthetic aspects of such sportiveness are infinite. Be it sufficient to say that 3
in such pastimes cats have exhibited traits and actions which psychologists 3
authentically declare to be motivated by genuine humour and whimsicality in its 3
purest sense; so that the task of "making a cat laugh" may not be so impossible a 3
thing even outside the borders of Cheshire. In short, a dog is an incomplete 3
thing. Like an inferior man, he needs emotional stimuli from outside, and must 3
set something artificial up as a god and motive. The cat, however, is perfect in 3
himself. Like the human philosopher, he is a self-sufficient entity and microcosm. 3
He is a real and integrated being because he thinks and feels himself to be such. 3
3
3
3
1263 3
3
3
3
whereas the dog can conceive of himself only in relation to something else. Whip 3
a dog and he licks your hand - frauth! The beast has no idea of himself except as 3
an inferior part of an organism whereof you are the superior part — he would no 3
more think of striking back at you than you would think of pounding your own 3
head when it punishes you with a headache. But whip a cat and watch it glare 3
and move backward hissing in outraged dignity and self-respect! One more 3
blow, and it strikes you in return; for it is a gentleman and your equal, and will 3
accept no infringement on its personality and body of privileges. It is only in 3
your house anyway because it wishes to be, or perhaps even as a condescending 3
favour to yourself. It is the house, not you, it likes; for philosophers realise that 3
human beings are at best only minor adjuncts to scenery. Go one step too far, and 3
it leaves you altogether. You have mistaken your relationship to it and imagined 3
you are its master, and no real cat can tolerate that breach of good manners. 3
Henceforward it will seek companions of greater discrimination and clearer 3
perspective. Let anaemic persons who believe in "turning the other cheek" 3
console themselves with cringing dogs — for the robust pagan with the blood of 3
Nordic twilights in his veins there is no beast like the cat; intrepid steed of Freya, 3
who can boldly look even Thor and Odin full in the face and stare with great 3
round eyes of undimmed yellow or green. 3
3
In these observations I believe I have outlined with some fullness the diverse 3
reasons why, in my opinion and in the smartly timed title-phrase of Mr. Van 3
Doren, "gentlemen prefer cats." The reply of Mr. Terhune in a subsequent issue 3
of the Tribune appears to me beside the point; insomuch as it is less a refutation 3
of facts than a mere personal affirmation of the author's membership in that 3
conventional "very human" majority who take affection and companionship 3
seriously, enjoy being important to something alive, hate a "parasite" on mere 3
ethical ground without consulting the right of beauty to exist for its own sake, 3
and therefore love man's noblest and most faithful friend, the perennial dog. I 3
suppose Mr. Terhune loves horses and babies also, for the three go 3
conventionally together in the great hundred-per-center's credo as highly 3
essential likings for every good and lovable he-man of the Arrow Collar and 3
Harold Bell Wright hero school, even though the automobile and Margaret 3
Sanger have done much to reduce the last two items. 3
3
Dogs, then, are peasants and the pets of peasants, cats are gentlemen and the pets 3
of gentlemen. The dog is for him who places crude feeling and outgrown ethic 3
and humanocentricity above austere and disinterested beauty; who just loves 3
"folks and folksiness" and doesn't mind sloppy clumsiness if only something 3
will truly care for him. (Tableau of dog across master's grave — cf. Lanseer, "The 3
Old Shepherd's Chief Mourner.") The guy who isn't much for highbrow stuff, 3
but is always on the square and don't (sic) often find the Saddypost or the N.Y. 3
World too deep for him; who hadn't much use for Valentino, but thinks Doug 3
3
3
3
1264 3
3
3
3
Fairbanks is just about right for an evening's entertainment. Wholesome — 3
constructive — non-morbid — civic-minded — domestic — (I forgot to mention 3
the radio) normal — that's the sort of go-getter that ought to go in for dogs. 3
3
The cat is for the aristocrat — whether by birth or inclinations or both - who 3
admires his fellow-aristocrats. He is for the man who appreciates beauty as the 3
one living force in a blind and purposeless universe, and who worships that 3
beauty in all its forms without regard for the sentimental and ethical illusions of 3
the moment. For the man who knows the hoUowness of feeling and the 3
emptiness of human objects and aspirations, and who therefore clings solely to 3
what is real — as beauty is real because it pretends to a significance beyond the 3
emotion which it excites and is. For the man who feels sufficient in the cosmos, 3
and asks no scruples of conventional prejudice, but loves repose and strength 3
and freedom and luxury and sufficiency and contemplation; who as a strong 3
fearless soul wishes something to respect instead of something to lick his face 3
and accept his alternate blows and strokings; who seeks a proud and beautiful 3
equal in the peerage of individualism rather than a cowed and cringing satellite 3
in the hierarchy of fear, subservience, and devolution. The cat is not for the brisk, 3
self-important little worker with a mission, but for the enlightened dreaming 3
poet who knows that the world contains nothing really worth doing. The 3
dilettante — the connoisseur — the decadent, if you will, though in a healthier 3
age than this there were things for such men to do, so that they were the planners 3
and leader of those glorious pagan times. The cat is for him who does things not 3
for empty duty but for power, pleasure, splendour, romance, and glamour — for 3
the harpist who sings alone in the night of old battles, or the warrior who goes 3
out to fight such battles for beauty, glory, fame and the splendour of a land 3
athwart which no shadow of weakness falls. For him who will be lulled by no 3
sops of prose and usefulness, but demands for his comfort the ease and beauty 3
and ascendancy and cultivation which make effort worth while. For the man 3
who knows that play, not work, and leisure, not bustle, are the great things of 3
life; and that the round of striving merely in order to strive some more is a bitter 3
irony of which the civilised soul accepts as little as it can. 3
3
Beauty, sufficiency, ease, and good manners — what more can civilisation 3
require? We have them all in the divine monarch who lounges gloriously on his 3
silken cushion before the hearth. Loveliness and joy for their own sake — pride 3
and harmony and coordination — spirit, restfulness and completeness — all here 3
are present, and need but a sympathetic disillusionment for worship in full 3
measure. What fully civilised soul but would eagerly serve as high priest of Bast? 3
The star of the cat, I think, is just now in the ascendant, as we emerge little by 3
little from the dreams of ethics and conformity which clouded the nineteenth 3
century and raised the grubbing and unlovely dog to the pinnacle of sentimental 3
regard. Whether a renaissance of power and beauty will restore our Western 3
3
3
3
1265 3
3
3
3
civilisation, or whether the forces of disintegration are aheady too powerful for 3
any hand to check, none may yet say, but in the present moment of cynical 3
world-unmasking between the pretence of the eighteen-hundreds and the 3
ominous mystery of the decades ahead we have at least a flash of the old pagan 3
perspective and the old pagan clearness and honesty. 3
3
And one idol lit up by that flash, seen fair and lovely on a dream-throne of silk 3
and gold under a chryselephantine dome, is a shape of deathless grace not 3
always given its due among groping mortals — the haughty, the unconquered, 3
the mysterious, the luxurious, the Babylonian, the impersonal, the eternal 3
companion of superiority and art — the type of perfect beauty and the brother of 3
poetry — the bland, grave, compliant, and patrician cat. 3

Letter to August Derleth 3
3
December 11, 1919 3
3
Before quitting the subject of Loveman and horror stories, I must relate the 3
frightful dream I had the night after I received S.L.'s latest letter. We have lately 3
been discussing weird tales at length, and he has recommended several hair- 3
raising books to me; so that I was in the mood to connect him with any thought 3
of hideousness or supernatural terror. I do not recall how this dream began, or 3
what it was really all about. There remains in my mind only one damnably 3
blood-curdling fragment whose ending haunts me yet. We were, for some 3
terrible yet unknown reason, in a very strange and very ancient cemetery - which 3
I could not identify. I suppose no Wisconsinite can picture such a thing - but we 3
have them in New England; horrible old places where the slate stones are graven 3
with odd letters and grotesque designs such as a skull and crossbones. In some of 3
these places one can walk a long way without coming upon any grave less than 3
an hundred and fifty years old. Some day, when Cook issues that promised 3
MONADNOCK, you will see my tale "The Tomb", which was inspired by one of 3
these places. Such was the scene of my dream - a hideous hollow whose surface 3
was covered with a coarse, repulsive sort of long grass, above which peeped the 3
shocking stones and markers of decaying slate. In a hillside were several tombs 3
whose facades were in the last stages of decrepitude. I had an odd idea that no 3
living thing had trodden that ground for many centuries till Loveman and I 3
arrived. It was very late in the night - probably in the small hours, since a waning 3
crescent moon had attained considerable height in the east. Loveman carried, 3
slung over his shoulder, a portable telephone outfit; whilst I bore two spades. We 3
proceeded directly to a flat sepulchre near the centre of the horrible place, and 3
began to clear away the moss-grown earth which had been washed down upon it 3
by the rains of innumerable years. Loveman, in the dream, looked exactly like the 3
snapshots of himself which he has sent me - a large, robust young man, not the 3
least Semitic in features (albeit dark), and very handsome save for a pair of 3
protruding ears. We did not speak as he laid down his telephone outfit, took a 3
shovel, and helped me clear away the earth and weeds. We both seemed very 3
much impressed with something - almost awestruck. At last we completed these 3
preliminaries, and Loveman stepped back to survey the sepulchre. He seemed to 3
know exactly what he was about to do, and I also had an idea - though I cannot 3
now remember what it was! All I recall is that we were following up some idea 3
which Loveman had gained as the result of extensive reading in some old rare 3
books, of which he possessed the only existing copies. (Loveman, you may know, 3
has a vast library of rare first editions and other treasures precious to the 3
bibliophile's heart.) After some mental estimates, Loveman took up his shovel 3
again, and using it as a lever, sought to pry up a certain slab which formed the 3
3
3
3
1267 3
3
3
3
top of the sepulchre. He did not succeed, so I approached and helped him with 3
my own shovel. Finally we loosened the stone, lifted it with our combined 3
strength, and heaved it away. Beneath was a black passageway with a flight of 3
stone steps; but so horrible were the miasmic vapours which poured up from the 3
pit, that we stepped back for a while without making further observations. Then 3
Loveman picked up the telephone output and began to uncoil the wire - 3
speaking for the first time as he did so. 3
3
"I'm really sorry", he said in a mellow, pleasant voice; cultivated, and not very 3
deep, "to have to ask you to stay above ground, but I couldn't answer for the 3
consequences if you were to go down with me. Honestly, I doubt if anyone with 3
a nervous system like yours could see it through. You can't imagine what I shall 3
have to see and do - not even from what the book said and from what I have told 3
you - and I don't think anyone without iron-clad nerves could ever go down and 3
come out of that place alive and sane. At any rate, this is no place for anybody 3
who can't pass an army physical examination. I discovered this thing, and I am 3
responsible in a way for anyone who goes with me - so I would not for a 3
thousand dollars let you take the risk. But I'll keep you informed of every move I 3
make by the telephone - you see I've enough wire to reach to the centre of the 3
earth and back!" 3
3
I argued with him, but he replied that if I did not agree, he would call the thing 3
off and get another fellow-explorer - he mentioned a "Dr. Burke," a name 3
altogether unfamiliar to me. He added, that it would be of no use for me to 3
descend alone, since he was sole possessor of the real key to the affair. Finally I 3
assented, and seated myself upon a marble bench close by the open grave, 3
telephone in hand. He produced an electric lantern, prepared the telephone wire 3
for unreeling, and disappeared down the damp stone steps, the insulated wire 3
rustling as it uncoiled. For a moment I kept track of the glow of his lantern, but 3
suddenly it faded out, as if there were a turn in the stone staircase. Then all was 3
still. After this came a period of dull fear and anxious waiting. The crescent 3
moon climbed higher, and the mist or fog about the hollow seemed to thicken. 3
Everything was horribly damp and bedewed, and I thought I saw an owl flitting 3
somewhere in the shadows. Then a clicking sounded in the telephone receiver. 3
3
"Lovecraft - I think I'm finding it" - the words came in a tense, excited tone. Then 3
a brief pause, followed by more words in atone of ineffable awe and horror. 3
3
"God, Lovecraft! If you could see what I am seeing!" I now asked in great 3
excitement what had happened. Loveman answered in a trembling voice: "I can't 3
tell you - 1 don't dare - 1 never dreamed of this - 1 can't tell - It's enough to unseat 3
any mind - wait - what's this?" Then a pause, a clicking in the receiver, and a sort 3
of despairing groan. Speech again - "Lovecraft - for God's sake - it's all up - Beat 3
3
3
3
1268 3
3
3
3
it! Beat it! Don't lose a second!" I was now thoroughly alarmed, and frantically 3
asked Loveman to tell what the matter was. He replied only "Never mind! 3
Hurry!" Then I felt a sort of offence through my fear - it irked me that anyone 3
should assume that I would be willing to desert a companion in peril. I 3
disregarded his advice and told him I was coming down to his aid. But he cried: 3
3
"Don't be a fool - it's too late - there's no use - nothing you or anyone can do 3
now." He seemed calmer - with a terrible, resigned calm, as if he had met and 3
recognised an inevitable, inescapable doom. Yet he was obviously anxious that I 3
should escape some unknown peril. 3
3
"For God's sake get out of this, if you can find the way! I'm not joking - So long, 3
Lovecraft, won't see you again - God! Beat it! Beat it!" As he shrieked out the last 3
words, his tone was a frenzied crescendo. I have tried to recall the wording as 3
nearly as possible, but I cannot reproduce the tone. There followed a long - 3
hideously long - period of silence. I tried to move to assist Loveman, but was 3
absolutely paralysed. The slightest motion was an impossibility. I could speak, 3
however, and kept calling excitedly into the telephone - "Loveman! Loveman! 3
What is it? What's the trouble?" But he did not reply. And then came the 3
unbelievably frightful thing - the awful, unexplainable, almost unmentionable 3
thing. I have said that Loveman was now silent, but after a vast interval of 3
terrified waiting another clicking came into the receiver. I called "Loveman - are 3
you there?" And in reply came a voice - a thing which I cannot describe by any 3
words I know. Shall I say that it was hollow - very deep - fluid - gelatinous - 3
indefinitely distant - unearthly - guttural - thick? What shall I say? In that 3
telephone I heard it; heard it as I sat on a marble bench in that very ancient 3
unknown cemetery with the crumbling stones and tombs and long grass and 3
dampness and the owl and the waning crescent moon. Up from the sepulchre it 3
came, and this is what it said: 3
3
"YOU FOOL, LOVEMAN IS DEAD!" 3
3
Well, that's the whole damn thing! I fainted in the dream, and the next I knew I 3
was awake - and with a prize headache! I don't know yet what it was all about - 3
what on (or under) earth we were looking for, or what that hideous voice at the 3
last was supposed to be. I have read of ghouls - mould shades - but hell - the 3
headache I had was worse than the dream! Loveman will laugh when I tell him 3
about that dream! In due time, I intend to weave this picture into a story, as I 3
wove another dream-picture into "The Doom that Came to Sarnath". I wonder, 3
though, if I have a right to claim authorship of things I dream? I hate to take 3
credit, when I did not really think out the picture with my own conscious wits. 3
Yet if I do not take credit, who'n Heaven will I give credit tuh? Coleridge 3
3
3
3
1269 3
3
3
3
claimed "Kubla Khan", so I guess I'll claim the thing an' let it go at that. But 3
believe muh, that was some dream! 3
3
(Lovecraft wrote The Statement of Randolph Carter based on this dream.) 3

3
Metrical Regularity 3
3
3
3
Of the various forms of decadence manifest in the poetical art of the present age, 3
none strikes more harshly on our sensibilities than the alarming decline in that 3
harmonious regularity of metre which adorned the poetry of our immediate 3
ancestors. 3
3
That metre itself forms an essential part of all true poetry is a principle which not 3
even the assertions of an Aristotle or the pronouncements of a Plato can 3
disestablish. As old a critic as Dionysius of Halicarnassus and as modern an 3
philosopher as Hegel have each affirmed that versification in poetry is not alone 3
a necessary attribute, but the very foundation as well; Hegel, indeed, placing 3
metre above metaphorical imagination as the essence of all poetic creation. 3
3
Science can likewise trace the metrical instinct from the very infancy of mankind, 3
or even beyond, to the pre-human age of the apes. Nature is in itself an unending 3
succession of regular impulses. The steady recurrence of the seasons and of the 3
moonlight, the coming and going of the day, the ebb and flow of the tides, the 3
beating of the heart and pulses, the tread of the feet in walking, the countless 3
other phenomena of like regularity, have all combined to inculcate in the human 3
brain a rhythmic sense which is as manifest in the most uncultivated, as in the 3
most polished of peoples. Metre, therefore, is no such false artifice as most 3
exponents of radicalism would have us believe, but is instead a natural and 3
inevitable embellishment to poesy, which succeeding ages should develop and 3
refine, rather than maim or destroy. 3
3
Like other instincts, the metric sense has taken on different aspects among 3
different races. Savages show it in its simplest form while dancing to the sound 3
of primitive drums; barbarians display it in their religious and other chantings; 3
civilized peoples utilize it for their formal poetry, either as measured quantity, 3
like that of Greek and Roman verse, or as measured accentual stress, like that of 3
our own English verse. Precision of metre is thus no mere display of meretricious 3
ornament, but a logical evolution from eminently natural sources. 3
3
It is the contention of the ultra-modern poet, as enunciated by Mrs. J. W. 3
Renshaw in her recent article on "The Autocracy of Art," (The Looking Glass for 3
May) that the truly inspired bard must chant forth his feelings independently of 3
form or language, permitting each changing impulse to alter the rhythm of his 3
lay, and blindly resigning his reason to the "fine frenzy" of his mood. This 3
contention is of course founded upon the assumption that poetry is super- 3
intellectual; the expression of a "soul" which outranks the mind and its precepts. 3
Now while avoiding the impeachment of this dubious theory, we must needs 3
3
3
3
1271 3
3
3
3
remark that the laws of Nature cannot so easily be outdistanced. However much 3
true poesy may overtop the produce of the brain, it must still be affected by 3
natural laws, which are universal and inevitable. Wherefore it is the various 3
clearly defined natural forms through which the emotions seek expression. 3
3
Indeed, we feel even unconsciously the fitness of certain types of metre for 3
certain types of thought, and in perusing a crude or irregular poem are often 3
abruptly repelled by the unwarranted variations made by the bard, either 3
through his ignorance or his perverted taste. We are naturally shocked at the 3
clothing of a grave subject in anapestic metre, or the treatment of a long and lofty 3
theme in short, choppy lines. This latter defect is what repels us so much from 3
Coninghton's really scholarly translation of the Aeneid. 3
3
What the radicals so wantonly disregard in their eccentric performances is unity 3
of thought. Amidst their wildly repeated leaps from one rough metre to another, 3
they ignore the underlying uniformity of each of their poems. Scene may change; 3
atmosphere may vary; yet one poem cannot carry but one definite message, and 3
to suit this ultimate and fundamental message but one metre must be selected 3
and sustained. To accommodate the minor inequalities of tone in a poem, one 3
regular metre will amply lend itself to diversity. Our chief but now annoyingly 3
neglected measure, the heroic couplet, is capable of taking on the infinite shades 3
of expression by the right selection of sequence of words, and by the proper 3
placing of the caesura or pause in each line. Dr. Blair, in his 38th lecture, explains 3
and illustrates with admirable perspicuity the importance of the caesura's 3
location in varying the flow of heroic verse. It is also possible to lend variety to a 3
poem by using very judiciously occasional feet of a metre different from that of 3
the body of the work. This is generally done without disturbing the 3
syllabification, and it in no way impairs or obscures the dominant measure. 3
3
Most amusing of all the claims of the radical is the assertion that true poetic 3
fervor can never be confined to regular metre; that the wild-eyed, long-haired 3
rider of Pegasus must inflict upon a suffering public in unaltered form the vague 3
conceptions which flit in noble chaos through his exalted soul. While it is 3
perfectly obvious that the hour of rare inspiration must be improved without the 3
hindrance of grammars or rhyming dictionaries, it is no less obvious that the 3
succeeding hour of calmer contemplation may very profitably be devoted to 3
amendment and polishing. The "language of the heart" must be clarified and 3
made intelligible to other hearts, else its purport will forever be confined to its 3
creator. If natural laws of metrical construction be willfully set aside, the reader's 3
attention will be distracted from the soul of the poem to its uncouth and ill-fitting 3
dress. The more nearly perfect the metre, the less conspicuous its presence; hence 3
if the poet desires supreme consideration for his matter, he should make his 3
verses so smooth that the sense may never be interrupted. 3
3
3
3
1272 3
3
3
3
The ill effect of metrical laxity on the younger generation of poets is enormous. 3
These latest suitors of the Muse, not yet sufficiently trained to distinguish 3
between their own artless crudities and the cultivated monstrosities of the 3
educated but radical bard, come to regard with distrust the orthodox critics, and 3
to believe that no grammatical, rhetorical, or metrical skill is necessary to their 3
own development. The result cannot but be a race of churlish, cacophonous 3
hybrids, whose amorphous outcries will waver uncertainly betwixt prose and 3
verse, absorbing the vices of both and the virtues of neither. 3
3
When proper consideration shall be taken of the perfect naturalness of polished 3
metre, a wholesome reaction against the present chaos must inevitably occur; so 3
that the few remaining disciples of conservatism and good taste may justly 3
entertain one last, lingering hope of hearing from modern lyres the stately 3
heroics of Pope, the majestic blank verse of Thomson, the terse octosyllabics of 3
Swift, the sonorous quatrains of Gray, and the lively anapests of Sheridan and 3
Moore. 3

The Allowable Rhyme 3
3
"Sed ubi plira nitent in carmine, non ego paucis Offendar maculis." - Horace 3
3
The poetical tendency of the present and of the preceding century has been 3
divided in a manner singularly curious. One loud and conspicuous faction of 3
bards, giving way to the corrupt influences of a decaying general culture, seems 3
to have abandoned all the properties of versification and reason in its mad 3
scramble after sensational novelty; whilst the other and quieter school 3
constituting a more logical evolution from the poesy of the Georgian period, 3
demands an accuracy of rhyme and metre unknown even to the polished artists 3
of the age of Pope. 3
3
The rational contemporary disciple of the Nine, justly ignoring the dissonant 3
shrieks of the radicals, is therefore confronted with a grave choice of technique. 3
May he retain the liberties of imperfect or "allowable" rhyming which were 3
enjoyed by his ancestors, or must he conform to the new ideals of perfection 3
evolved during the past century? The writer of this article is frankly an archaist 3
in verse. He has not scrupled to rhyme "toss'd" with "coast", "come" with 3
"Rome", or "home" with "gloom" in his very latest published efforts, thereby 3
proclaiming his maintenance of the old-fashioned pets as models; but sound 3
modern criticism, proceeding from Mr. Rheinhart Kleiner and from other sources 3
which must needs command respect, has impelled him there to rehearse the 3
question for public benefit, and particularly to present his own side, attempting 3
to justify his adherence to the style of two centuries ago. 3
3
The earliest English attempts at rhyming probably included words whose 3
agreement is so slight that it deserves the name of mere "assonance" rather than 3
that of actual rhyme. Thus in the original ballad of "Chevy-Chase," we encounter 3
"King" and "within" supposedly rhymed, whilst in the similar "Battle of 3
Otterbourne" we behold "long" rhymed with "down," "ground" with 3
"Agurstonne," and "name" with "again". In the ballad of "Sir Patrick Spense," 3
"morn" and "storm," and "deep" and "feet" are rhymed. But the infelicities were 3
obviously the result not of artistic negligence, but of plebeian ignorance, since the 3
old ballads were undoubtedly the careless products of a peasant minstrelsy. In 3
Chaucer, a poet of the Court, the allowable rhyme is but infrequently discovered, 3
hence we may assume that the original ideal in English verse was the perfect 3
rhyming sound. 3
3
Spenser uses allowable rhymes, giving in one of his characteristic stanzas the 3
three distinct sounds of "Lord", "ador'd", and "word," all supposed to rhyme; 3
but of his pronunciation we know little, and may justly guess that to the ears of 3
3
3
3
1274 3
3
3
3
his contemporaries the sounds were not conspicuously different. Ben Johnson's 3
employment of imperfect rhyming was much like Spenser's; moderate, and 3
partially to be excused on account of a chaotic pronunciation. The better poets of 3
the Restoration were also sparing of allowable rhymes; Cowley, Waller, Marvell, 3
and many others being quite regular in this respect. 3
3
It was therefore upon a world unprepared that Samuel Butler burst forth with his 3
immortal "Hudibras," whose comical familiarity of diction is in grotesqueness 3
surpassed only by its clever licentiousness of rhyming. Butler's well-known 3
double rhymes are of necessity forced and inexact, and in ordinary single rhymes 3
he seems to have had no more regard for precision. "Vow'd" and "would," 3
"talisman" and "slain," "restores" and "devours" are a few specimens selected at 3
random. 3
3
Close after Butler came Jon Oldham, a satirist whose force and brilliance gained 3
him universal praise, and whose enormous crudity both in rhyme and in metre 3
was forgiven amidst the splendor of his attacks. Oldham was almost absolutely 3
ungoverned by the demands of the ear, and perpetrated such atrocious rhymes 3
as "heads" and "besides," "devise" and "this," "again" and "sin," "tool" and 3
"foul," "end" and "design'd," and even "prays" and "cause." 3
3
The glorious Dryden, refiner and purifier of English verse, did less for rhyme 3
than he did for metre. Though nowhere attaining the extravagances of his friend 3
Oldham, he lent the sanction of his great authority to rhymes which Dr. Johnson 3
admits are "open to objection." But one vast difference betwixt Dryden and his 3
loose predecessors must be observed. Dryden had so far improved metrical 3
cadence, that the final syllables of heroic couplets stood out in especial eminence, 3
displaying and emphasizing every possible similarity of sound; that is, lending 3
to sounds in the first place approximately similar, the added similarity caused by 3
the new prominence of their perfectly corresponding positions in their respective 3
lines. 3
3
It were needless to dwell upon the rhetorical polish of the age immediately 3
succeeding Dryden's. So far as English versification is concerned. Pope was the 3
world, and all the world was Pope. Dryden had founded a new school of verse, 3
but the development and ultimate perfections of this art remained for the sickly 3
lad who before the age of twelve begged to be taken to Will's Coffee-House, that 3
he might obtain a personal view of the aged Dryden, his idol and model. 3
Delicately attuned to the subtlest harmonies of poetical construction, Alexander 3
Pope brought English prosody to its zenith, and still stands alone on the heights, 3
yet he, exquisite master of verse that he was, frowned not upon imperfect 3
rhymes, provided they were set in faultless metre. Though most of his allowable 3
rhymes are merely variations in the breadth and nature of vowel sounds, he in 3
3
3
3
1275 3
3
3
3
one instance departs far enough from rigid perfection to rhyme the words "vice" 3
and "destroys." Yet who can take offence? The unvarying ebb and flow of the 3
refined metrical impulse conceals and condones all else. 3
3
Every argument by which English blank verse or Spanish assonant verse is 3
sustained, may with greater force be applied to the allowable rhyme. Metre is the 3
real essential of poetical technique, and when two sounds of substantial 3
resemblance are so placed that one follows the other in a certain measured 3
relation, the normal ear cannot without cavilling find fault with a slight want of 3
identity in the respective dominant vowels. The rhyming of a long vowel with a 3
short one is common in all the Georgian poets, and when well recited cannot but 3
be overlooked amidst the general flow of the verse; as, for instance, the following 3
from Pope: 3
3
But thinks, admitted to that equal sky. 3
3
His faithful dog shall bear him company. 3
3
Of like nature is the rhyming of actually different vowels whose sounds are, 3
when pronounced in animated oration, by no means dissimilar. Out of verse, 3
such words as "join" and "line" are quite unlike, but Pope well rhymes them 3
when he writes: 3
3
While expletives their feeble aid do join, 3
3
and ten low words oft creep in one dull line. 3
3
It is the final consonantal sound in rhyming which can never vary. This, above all 3
else, gives the desired similarity. Syllables which agree in vowels but not in the 3
final consonants are not rhymes at all, but simply assonants. Yet such is the 3
inconsistent carelessness of the average modern writer, that he often uses mere 3
assonants to a greater extent than his fathers ever employed actually allowable 3
rhymes. The writer, in his critical duties, has more than once been forced to point 3
out the attempted rhyming of such words as "fame" and "lane," "task" and 3
"glass," or "feels" and "yields" and in view of these impossible combinations he 3
cannot blame himself very seriously for rhyming "art" and "shot" in the March 3
Conservative; for this pair of words have at least identical consonants at the end. 3
3
That allowable rhymes have real advantages of a positive sort is an opinion by 3
no means lightly to be denied. The monotony of a long heroic poem may often be 3
pleasantly relieved by judicious interruptions in the perfect successions of 3
rhymes, just as the metre may sometimes be adorned with occasional triplets and 3
Alexandrines. Another advantage is the greater latitude allowed for the 3
expression of thought. How numerous are the writers who, from restriction to 3
perfect rhyming, are frequently compelled to abandon a neat epigram, or 3
3
3
3
1276 3
3
3
3
brilliant antithesis, which allowable rhyme would easily permit, or else to 3
introduce a dull expletive merely to supply a desired rhyme! 3
3
But a return to historical considerations shows us only too clearly the logical 3
trend of taste, and the reason Mr. Kleiner's demand for absolute perfection is no 3
idle cry. In Oliver Goldsmith there arose one who, though retaining the familiar 3
classical diction of Pope, yet advanced further still toward what he deemed ideal 3
polish by virtually abandoning the allowable rhyme. In unvaried exactitude run 3
the couplets of "The Traveler" and of "The Deserted Village," and none can deny 3
to them a certain urbanity which pleases the critical ear. With but little less 3
precision are molded the simple rhymes of Cowper, whilst the pompous 3
Erasmus Darwin likewise shows more attention to identity of sound than do the 3
Queen Anne Bards. Gifford's translations of Juvenal and Persius show to an 3
almost equal degree the tendency of the age, and Campbell, Crabbe, 3
Wordsworth, Byron, Keats, and Thomas Moore are all inclined to refrain from 3
the liberties practiced by those of former times. To deny the importance of such a 3
widespread change of technique is fruitless, for its existence argues for its 3
naturalness. The best critics of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries demand 3
perfect rhyming, and no aspirant for fame can afford to depart from a standard 3
so universal. It is evidently the true goal of the English, as well as of the French 3
bard; the goal from which we are but temporarily deflected during the preceding 3
age. 3
3
But exceptions should and must be made in the case of a few who have somehow 3
absorbed theatmosphere of other days, and who long in their hearts for the 3
stately sound of the old classic cadences. Well may their predilection for 3
imperfect rhyming be discouraged to a limited extent, but to chain them wholly 3
to modern rules would be barbarous. Every limited mind demands a certain 3
freedom of expression, and the man who cannot express himself satisfactorily 3
without the stimulation derived from the spirited mode of two centuries ago 3
should certainly be permitted to follow without undue restraint a practice so 3
harmless, so free from essential error, and so sanctioned by precedent, as that of 3
employing in his poetical compositions the smooth and inoffensive allowable 3
rhyme. 3

The Despised Pastoral 3
3
3
3
Among the many and complex tendencies observable in modern poetry, or what 3
answers for poetry in this age, is a decided but unjust scorn of the honest old 3
pastoral, immortalised by Theocritus and Virgil, and revived in our own 3
literature by Spencer. 3
3
Nor is this unfavorable attitude confined alone to the formal eclogue whose 3
classical elements are so well described and exemplified by Mr. Pope. Whenever 3
a versifier adorns his song with the pleasing and innocent imagery of this type of 3
composition, or borrows its mild and sweet atmosphere, he is forthwith 3
condemned as an irresponsible pedant and fossil by every little-wit critic in 3
Grub-street. 3
3
Modern bards, in their endeavour to display with seriousness and minute 3
verisimilitude the inward operations of the human mind and emotions, have 3
come to look down upon the simple description of ideal beauty, or the 3
straightforward presentation of pleasing images for no other purpose than to 3
delight the fancy. Such themes they deem trivial and artificial, and altogether 3
unworthy of an art whose design they take to be the analysis and reproduction of 3
Nature in all her moods and aspects. 3
3
But in this belief, the writer cannot but hold that our contemporaries are 3
misjudging the true province and functions of poesy. It was no starched 3
classicist, but the exceedingly unconventional Edgar Allen Poe, who roundly 3
denounced the melancholy metaphysicians and maintained that true poetry has 3
for its first object "pleasure, not truth", and "indefinite pleasure instead of 3
definite pleasure," intimating that its concern for the dull or ugly aspects of life is 3
slight ideed. That the American bard and critic was fundamentally just in his 3
deductions, seems well proved by a comparative survey of those poems of all 3
ages which have lived, and those which have fallen into deserved obscurity. 3
3
The English pastoral, based upon the best models of antiquity, depicts engaging 3
scenes of Arcadian simplicity, which not only transport the imagination through 3
their intrinsic beauty, but recall to the scholarly mind the choicest remembrances 3
of classical Greece and Rome. Though the combination of rural pursuits with 3
polished sentiments and diction is patently artificial, the beauty is not a whit less; 3
nor do the conventional names, phrases, and images detract in the least from the 3
quaint agreeableness of the whole. The magic of this sort of verse is to any 3
unprejudiced mind irresistible, and capable of evoking a more deliciously placid 3
and refreshing train of pictures in the imagination than may be obtained from 3
any more realistic species of composition. Every untainted fancy begets ideal 3
3
3
3
1278 3
3
3
3
visions of which the pastoral forms a legitimate and artistically necessary 3
reflection. 3
3
It is not impossible that the intellectual upheaval attendant upon the present 3
conflict will bring about a general simplification and rectification of taste, and an 3
appreciation of the value of pure imaginary beauty in a world so full of actual 3
misery, which may combine to restore the despised pastoral to its proper station. 3

England! My England! can the surging sea 3
3
That lies between us tear my heart from thee? 3
3
Can distant birth and distant dwelling drain 3
3
Th' ancestral blood that warms the loyal vein? 3
3
Isle of my Fathers! hear the filial song 3
3
Of him whose sources but to thee belong! 3
3
World-Conquering Mother! by thy mighty hand 3
3
Was carv'd from savage wilds my native land: 3
3
Thy matchless sons the firm foundation laid; 3
3
Thy matchless arts the nascent nation made: 3
3
By thy just laws the young republic grew. 3
3
And through thy greatness, kindred greatness knew. 3
3
What man that springs from thy untainted line 3
3
But sees Columbia's virtues all as thine? 3
3
Whilst nameless multitudes upon our shore 3
3
From the dim corners of creation pour. 3
3
Whilst mongrel slaves crawl hither to partake 3
3
Of Saxon liberty they could not make. 3
3
From such an alien crew in grief I turn. 3
3
And for the mother's voice of Britain burn. 3
3
England! can aught remove the cherish'd chain 3
3
That binds my spirit to thy blest domain? 3
3
Can Revolution's bitter precepts sway 3
3
The soul that must the ties of race obey? 3
3
Create a new Columbia if ye will. 3
3
The flesh that forms me is Britannic still! 3
3
Hail! oaken shades, and meads of dewy green. 3
3
So oft in sleep, yet ne'er in waking seen. 3
3
Peal out, ye ancient chimes, from vine-clad tower 3
3
Where pray'd my fathers in a vanish'd hour: 3
3
What countless years of rev'rence can ye claim 3
3
From bygone worshippers that bore my name! 3

Their forms are crumbling in the vaults around. 3

The stone-built abbey, rising o'er the plain; 3

The neighb'ring village with its sun-shower'd square; 3

The shaded mill-stream, and the forest fair. 3

The hedge-lin'd lane, that leads to rustic cot 3
3
Where sweet contentment is the peasant's lot: 3
3
The mystic grove, by Druid wraiths possess'd. 3
3
The flow'ring fields, with fairy -castles blest: 3
3
And the old manor-house, sedate and dark. 3
3
Set in the shadows of the wooded park. 3
3
Can this be dreaming? Must my eyelids close 3
3
That I may catch the fragrance of the rose? 3
3
Is it in fancy that the midnight vale 3
3
Thrills with the warblings of the nightingale? 3
3
A golden moon bewitching radiance yields. 3
3
And England's fairies trip o'er England's fields. 3
3
England! Old England! in my love for thee 3
3
No dream is mine, but blessed memory; 3
3
Such haunting images and hidden fires 3
3
Course with the bounding blood of British sires: 3
3
From British bodies, minds, and souls I come. 3
3
And from them draw the vision of their home. 3
3
Awake, Columbia! scorn the vulgar age 3
That bids thee slight thy lordly heritage. 3
Let not the wide Atlantic's wildest wave 3
Burst the blest bonds that fav'ring Nature gave: 3
Connecting surges 'twixt the nations run. 3
Our Saxon souls dissolving into one! 3

3
In the Midnight heaven's burning 3
Through the ethereal deeps afar 3
Once I watch'd with restless yearning 3
An alluring aureate star; 3
Ev'ry eve aloft returning 3
Gleaming nigh the Arctic Car. 3
3
Mystic waves of beauty blended 3
With the gorgeous golden rays 3
Phantasies of bliss descended 3
In a myrrh'd Elysian haze. 3
In the lyre-born chords extended 3
Harmonies of Lydian lays. 3
3
And (thought I) lies scenes of pleasure. 3
Where the free and blessed dwell. 3
And each moment bears a treasure. 3
Freighted with the lotos-spell. 3
And there floats a liquid measure 3
From the lute of Israfel. 3
3
There (I told myself) were shining 3
Worlds of happiness unknown. 3
Peace and Innocence entwining 3
By the Crowned Virtue's throne; 3
Men of light, their thoughts refining 3
Purer, fairer, than my own. 3
3
Thus I mus'd when o'er the vision 3
Crept a red delirious change; 3
Hope dissolving to derision. 3
Beauty to distortion strange; 3
Hymnic chords in weird collision. 3
Spectral sights in endless range. ... 3
Crimson burn'd the star of madness 3
As behind the beams I peer'd; 3
All was woe that seem'd but gladness 3
Ere my gaze with Truth was sear'd; 3
Cacodaemons, mir'd with madness. 3
Through the fever'd flick'ring leer'd. ... 3

3
Now I know the fiendish fable 3

Haunts my soul forevermore! 3

Despair 3
3
February 1919 3
3
O'er the midnight moorlands crying. 3
Thro' the cypress forests sighing. 3
In the night-wind madly flying. 3
Hellish forms with streaming hair; 3
In the barren branches creaking. 3
By the stagnant swamp-pools speaking. 3
Past the shore-cliffs ever shrieking, 3
Damn'd demons of despair. 3
3
Once, I think I half remember. 3
Ere the grey skies of November 3
Quench'd my youth's aspiring ember, 3
Liv'd there such a thing as bliss; 3
Skies that now are dark were beaming. 3
Bold and azure, splendid seeming 3
Till I learn'd it all was dreaming — 3
Deadly drowsiness of Dis. 3
3
But the stream of Time, swift flowing. 3
Brings the torment of half -knowing — 3
Dimly rushing, blindly going 3
Past the never-trodden lea; 3
And the voyager, repining. 3
Sees the wicked death-fires shining. 3
Hears the wicked petrel's whining 3
As he helpless drifts to sea. 3
3
Evil wings in ether beating; 3
Vultures at the spirit eating; 3
Things unseen forever fleeting 3
Black against the leering sky. 3
Ghastly shades of bygone gladness. 3
Clawing fiends of future sadness. 3
Mingle in a cloud of madness 3
Ever on the soul to lie. 3
3
Thus the living, lone and sobbing. 3
In the throes of anguish throbbing. 3
3
3
3
1286 3

3
I. The Book 3
3
The place was dark and dusty and half-lost 3
In tangles of old alleys near the quays. 3
Reeking of strange things brought in from the seas. 3
And with queer curls of fog that west winds tossed. 3
Small lozenge panes, obscured by smoke and frost. 3
Just shewed the books, in piles like twisted trees. 3
Rotting from floor to roof - congeries 3
Of crumbling elder lore at little cost. 3
3
I entered, charmed, and from a cobw ebbed heap 3
Took up the nearest tome and thumbed it through. 3
Trembling at curious words that seemed to keep 3
Some secret, monstrous if one only knew. 3
Then, looking for some seller old in craft, 3
I could find nothing but a voice that laughed. 3
3
II. Pursuit 3
3
I held the book beneath my coat, at pains 3
To hide the thing from sight in such a place; 3
Hurrying through the ancient harbor lanes 3
With often-turning head and nervous pace. 3
Dull, furtive windows in old tottering brick 3
Peered at me oddly as I hastened by. 3
And thinking what they sheltered, I grew sick 3
For a redeeming glimpse of clean blue sky. 3
3
No one had seen me take the thing - but still 3
3
A blank laugh echoed in my whirling head. 3
3
And I could guess what nighted worlds of ill 3
3
Lurked in that volume I had coveted. 3
3
The way grew strange - the walls alike and madding 3
3
And far behind me, unseen feet were padding. 3

III. The Key 3
3
I do not know what windings in the waste 3
3
Of those strange sea-lanes brought me home once more. 3
3
But on my porch I trembled, white with haste 3
3
To get inside and bolt the heavy door. 3
3
I had the book that told the hidden way 3
3
Across the void and through the space-hung screens 3
3
That hold the undimensioned worlds at bay. 3
3
And keep lost aeons to their own demesnes. 3
3
At last the key was mine to those vague visions 3
Of sunset spires and twilight woods that brood 3
Dim in the gulfs beyond this earth's precisions. 3
Lurking as memories of infinitude. 3
The key was mine, but as I sat there mumbling. 3
The attic window shook with a faint fumbling. 3
3
IV. Recognition 3
3
The day had come again, when as a child 3
I saw - just once - that hollow of old oaks. 3
Grey with a ground-mist that enfolds and chokes 3
The slinking shapes which madness has defiled. 3
It was the same - an herbage rank and wild 3
Clings round an altar whose carved sign invokes 3
That Nameless One to whom a thousand smokes 3
Rose, aeons gone, from unclean towers up-piled. 3
3
I saw the body spread on that dank stone. 3
3
And knew those things which feasted were not men; 3
3
I knew this strange, grey world was not my own. 3
3
But Yuggoth, past the starry voids - and then 3
3
The body shrieked at me with a dead cry. 3
3
And all too late I knew that it was I! 3
3
V. Homecoming 3
3
The daemon said that he would take me home 3
To the pale, shadowy land I half recalled 3
As a high place of stair and terrace, walled 3
With marble balustrades that sky -winds comb. 3
While miles below a maze of dome on dome 3
3
3
3
1291 3
3
3
3
And tower on tower beside a sea lies sprawled. 3
Once more, he told me, I would stand enthralled 3
On those old heights, and hear the far-off foam. 3
3
All this he promised, and through sunset's gate 3
3
He swept me, past the lapping lakes of flame. 3
3
And red-gold thrones of gods without a name 3
3
Who shriek in fear at some impending fate. 3
3
Then a black gulf with sea-sounds in the night: 3
3
"Here was your home," he mocked, "when you had sight!' 3

We found the lamp inside those hollow cliffs 3
Whose chiseled sign no priest in Thebes could read. 3
And from whose caverns frightened hieroglyphs 3
Warned every living creature of earth's breed. 3
No more was there - just that one brazen bowl 3
With traces of a curious oil within; 3
Fretted with some obscurely patterned scroll. 3
And symbols hinting vaguely of strange sin. 3
3
Little the fears of forty centuries meant 3
3
To us as we bore off our slender spoil. 3
3
And when we scanned it in our darkened tent 3
3
We struck a match to test the ancient oil. 3
3
It blazed - great God!. . . But the vast shapes we saw 3
3
In that mad flash have seared our lives with awe. 3
3
VII. Zaman's Hill 3
3
The great hill hung close over the old town, 3
3
A precipice against the main street's end; 3
3
Green, tall, and wooded, looking darkly down 3
3
Upon the steeple at the highway bend. 3
3
Two hundred years the whispers had been heard 3
3
About what happened on the man-shunned slope - 3
3
Tales of an oddly mangled deer or bird. 3
3
Or of lost boys whose kin had ceased to hope. 3
3
One day the mail-man found no village there. 3
Nor were its folk or houses seen again; 3
People came out from Aylesbury to stare - 3
3
3
3
1292 3
3
3
3
Yet they all told the mail-man it was plain 3
3
That he was mad for saying he had spied 3
3
The great hill's gluttonous eyes, and jaws stretched wide. 3
3
VIII. The Port 3
3
Ten miles from Arkham I had struck the trail 3
That rides the cliff-edge over Boynton Beach, 3
And hoped that just at sunset I could reach 3
The crest that looks on Innsmouth in the vale. 3
Far out at sea was a retreating sail. 3
White as hard years of ancient winds could bleach. 3
But evil with some portent beyond speech. 3
So that I did not wave my hand or hail. 3
3
Sails out of Innsmouth! echoing old renown 3
3
Of long-dead times. But now a too-swift night 3
3
Is closing in, and I have reached the height 3
3
Whence I so often scan the distant town. 3
3
The spires and roofs are there - but look! The gloom 3
3
Sinks on dark lanes, as lightless as the tomb! 3
3
IX. The Courtyard 3
3
It was the city I had known before; 3
The ancient, leprous town where mongrel throngs 3
Chant to strange gods, and beat unhallowed gongs 3
In crypts beneath foul alleys near the shore. 3
The rotting, fish-eyed houses leered at me 3
From where they leaned, drunk and half-animate. 3
As edging through the filth I passed the gate 3
To the black courtyard where the man would be. 3
3
The dark walls closed me in, and loud I cursed 3
That ever I had come to such a den. 3
When suddenly a score of windows burst 3
Into wild light, and swarmed with dancing men: 3
Mad, soundless revels of the dragging dead - 3
And not a corpse had either hands or head! 3
3
3
3
1293 3
3
3
3
X. The Pigeon-Flyers 3
3
They took me slumming, where gaunt walls of brick 3
3
Bulge outward with a viscous stored-up evil. 3
3
And twisted faces, thronging foul and thick. 3
3
Wink messages to alien god and devil. 3
3
A million fires were blazing in the streets. 3
3
And from flat roofs a furtive few would fly 3
3
Bedraggled birds into the yawning sky 3
3
While hidden drums droned on with measured beats. 3
3
I knew those fires were brewing monstrous things. 3
And that those birds of space had been Outside - 3
I guessed to what dark planet's crypts they plied. 3
And what they brought from Thog beneath their wings. 3
The others laughed - till struck too mute to speak 3
By what they glimpsed in one bird's evil beak. 3
3
XL The Well 3
3
Farmer Seth Atwood was past eighty when 3
He tried to sink that deep well by his door. 3
With only Eb to help him bore and bore. 3
We laughed, and hoped he'd soon be sane again. 3
And yet, instead, young Eb went crazy, too. 3
So that they shipped him to the county farm. 3
Seth bricked the well-mouth up as tight as glue - 3
Then hacked an artery in his gnarled left arm. 3
3
After the funeral we felt bound to get 3
Out to that well and rip the bricks away. 3
But all we saw were iron hand-holds set 3
Down a black hole deeper than we could say. 3
And yet we put the bricks back - for we found 3
The hole too deep for any line to sound. 3
3
XII. The Howler 3
3
They told me not to take the Briggs' Hill path 3
That used to be the highroad through to Zoar, 3
For Goody Watkins, hanged in seventeen-four. 3
Had left a certain monstrous aftermath. 3
Yet when I disobeyed, and had in view 3
3
3
3
1294 3
3
3
3
The vine-hung cottage by the great rock slope, 3
3
I could not think of elms or hempen rope. 3
3
But wondered why the house still seemed so new. 3
3
Stopping a while to watch the fading day, 3
I heard faint howls, as from a room upstairs. 3
When through the ivied panes one sunset ray 3
Struck in, and caught the howler unawares. 3
I glimpsed - and ran in frenzy from the place. 3
And from a four-pawed thing with human face. 3
3
XIII. Hesperia 3
3
The winter sunset, flaming beyond spires 3
And chimneys half-detached from this dull sphere. 3
Opens great gates to some forgotten year 3
Of elder splendours and divine desires. 3
Expectant wonders burn in those rich fires. 3
Adventure-fraught, and not untinged with fear; 3
A row of sphinxes where the way leads clear 3
Toward walls and turrets quivering to far lyres. 3
3
It is the land where beauty's meaning flowers; 3
Where every unplaced memory has a source; 3
Where the great river Time begins its course 3
Down the vast void in starlit streams of hours. 3
Dreams bring us close - but ancient lore repeats 3
That human tread has never soiled these streets. 3
3
XIV. Star-Winds 3
3
It is a certain hour of twilight glooms. 3
Mostly in autumn, when the star-wind pours 3
Down hilltop streets, deserted out-of-doors. 3
But shewing early lamplight from snug rooms. 3
The dead leaves rush in strange, fantastic twists. 3
And chimney-smoke whirls round with alien grace. 3
Heeding geometries of outer space. 3
While Fomalhaut peers in through southward mists. 3
3
This is the hour when moonstruck poets know 3
What fungi sprout in Yuggoth, and what scents 3
And tints of flowers fill Nithon's continents. 3
3
3
3
1295 3
3
3
3
Such as in no poor earthly garden blow. 3
Yet for each dream these winds to us convey, 3
A dozen more of ours they sweep away! 3
3
XV. Antarktos 3
3
Deep in my dream the great bird whispered queerly 3
Of the black cone amid the polar waste; 3
Pushing above the ice-sheet lone and drearly. 3
By storm-crazed aeons battered and defaced. 3
Hither no living earth-shapes take their courses. 3
And only pale auroras and faint suns 3
Glow on that pitted rock, whose primal sources 3
Are guessed at dimly by the Elder Ones. 3
3
If men should glimpse it, they would merely wonder 3
What tricky mound of Nature's build they spied; 3
But the bird told of vaster parts, that under 3
The mile-deep ice-shroud crouch and brood and bide. 3
God help the dreamer whose mad visions shew 3
Those dead eyes set in crystal gulfs below! 3
3
XVI. The Window 3
3
The house was old, with tangled wings outthrown. 3
Of which no one could ever half keep track. 3
And in a small room somewhat near the back 3
Was an odd window sealed with ancient stone. 3
There, in a dream-plagued childhood, quite alone 3
I used to go, where night reigned vague and black; 3
Parting the cobwebs with a curious lack 3
Of fear, and with a wonder each time grown. 3
3
One later day I brought the masons there 3
3
To find what view my dim forbears had shunned. 3
3
But as they pierced the stone, a rush of air 3
3
Burst from the alien voids that yawned beyond. 3
3
They fled - but I peered through and found unrolled 3
3
All the wild worlds of which my dreams had told. 3
3
3
3
1296 3
3
3
3
XVII. A Memory 3
3
There were great steppes, and rocky table-lands 3
Stretching half-limitless in starlit night. 3
With alien campfires shedding feeble light 3
On beasts with tinkling bells, in shaggy bands. 3
Far to the south the plain sloped low and wide 3
To a dark zigzag line of wall that lay 3
Like a huge python of some primal day 3
Which endless time had chilled and petrified. 3
3
I shivered oddly in the cold, thin air. 3
3
And wondered where I was and how I came. 3
3
When a cloaked form against a campfire's glare 3
3
Rose and approached, and called me by my name. 3
3
Staring at that dead face beneath the hood, 3
3
I ceased to hope - because I understood. 3
3
XVIII. The Gardens of Yin 3
3
Beyond that wall, whose ancient masonry 3
Reached almost to the sky in moss-thick towers. 3
There would be terraced gardens, rich with flowers. 3
And flutter of bird and butterfly and bee. 3
There would be walks, and bridges arching over 3
Warm lotos-pools reflecting temple eaves. 3
And cherry-trees with delicate boughs and leaves 3
Against a pink sky where the herons hover. 3
3
All would be there, for had not old dreams flung 3
Open the gate to that stone-lanterned maze 3
Where drowsy streams spin out their winding ways. 3
Trailed by green vines from bending branches hung? 3
I hurried - but when the wall rose, grim and great, 3
I found there was no longer any gate. 3
3
XIX. The Bells 3
3
Year after year I heard that faint, far ringing 3
Of deep-toned bells on the black midnight wind; 3
Peals from no steeple I could ever find. 3
But strange, as if across some great void winging. 3
I searched my dreams and memories for a clue. 3
3
3
3
1297 3
3
3
3
And thought of all the chimes my visions carried; 3
Of quiet Innsmouth, where the white gulls tarried 3
Around an ancient spire that once I knew. 3
3
Always perplexed I heard those far notes falling. 3
Till one March night the bleak rain splashing cold 3
Beckoned me back through gateways of recalling 3
To elder towers where the mad clappers tolled. 3
They tolled - but from the sunless tides that pour 3
Through sunken valleys on the sea's dead floor. 3
3
XX. Night-Gaunts 3
3
Out of what crypt they crawl, I cannot tell. 3
3
But every night I see the rubbery things. 3
3
Black, horned, and slender, with membraneous wings. 3
3
And tails that bear the bifid barb of hell. 3
3
They come in legions on the north wind's swell. 3
3
With obscene clutch that titillates and stings. 3
3
Snatching me off on monstrous voyagings 3
3
To grey worlds hidden deep in nightmare's well. 3
3
Over the jagged peaks of Thok they sweep. 3
3
Heedless of all the cries I try to make. 3
3
And down the nether pits to that foul lake 3
3
Where the puffed shoggoths splash in doubtful sleep. 3
3
But oh! If only they would make some sound. 3
3
Or wear a face where faces should be found! 3
3
XXL Nyarlathotep 3
3
And at the last from inner Egypt came 3
The strange dark One to whom the fellahs bowed; 3
Silent and lean and cryptically proud. 3
And wrapped in fabrics red as sunset flame. 3
Throngs pressed around, frantic for his commands. 3
But leaving, could not tell what they had heard; 3
While through the nations spread the awestruck word 3
That wild beasts followed him and licked his hands. 3
3
Soon from the sea a noxious birth began; 3
Forgotten lands with weedy spires of gold; 3
The ground was cleft, and mad auroras rolled 3
3
3
3
1298 3
3
3
3
Down on the quaking citadels of man. 3
3
Then, crushing what he chanced to mould in play. 3
3
The idiot Chaos blew Earth's dust away. 3
3
XXII. Azathoth 3
3
Out in the mindless void the daemon bore me. 3
3
Past the bright clusters of dimensioned space. 3
3
Till neither time nor matter stretched before me. 3
3
But only Chaos, without form or place. 3
3
Here the vast Lord of All in darkness muttered 3
3
Things he had dreamed but could not understand. 3
3
While near him shapeless bat-things flopped and fluttered 3
3
In idiot vortices that ray-streams fanned. 3
3
They danced insanely to the high, thin whining 3
Of a cracked flute clutched in a monstrous paw. 3
Whence flow the aimless waves whose chance combining 3
Gives each frail cosmos its eternal law. 3
"I am His Messenger," the daemon said. 3
As in contempt he struck his Master's head. 3
3
XXIII. Mirage 3
3
I do not know if ever it existed - 3
3
That lost world floating dimly on Time's stream - 3
3
And yet I see it often, violet-misted. 3
3
And shimmering at the back of some vague dream. 3
3
There were strange towers and curious lapping rivers. 3
3
Labyrinths of wonder, and low vaults of light. 3
3
And bough-crossed skies of flame, like that which quivers 3
3
Wistfully just before a winter's night. 3
3
Great moors led off to sedgy shores unpeopled. 3
Where vast birds wheeled, while on a windswept hill 3
There was a village, ancient and white-steepled. 3
With evening chimes for which I listen still. 3
I do not know what land it is - or dare 3
Ask when or why I was, or will be, there. 3
3
3
3
1299 3
3
3
3
XXIV. The Canal 3
3
Somewhere in dream there is an evil place 3
Where tall, deserted buildings crowd along 3
A deep, black, narrow channel, reeking strong 3
Of frightful things whence oily currents race. 3
Lanes with old walls half meeting overhead 3
Wind off to streets one may or may not know. 3
And feeble moonlight sheds a spectral glow 3
Over long rows of windows, dark and dead. 3
3
There are no footfalls, and the one soft sound 3
3
Is of the oily water as it glides 3
3
Under stone bridges, and along the sides 3
3
Of its deep flume, to some vague ocean bound. 3
3
None lives to tell when that stream washed away 3
3
Its dream-lost region from the world of clay. 3
3
XXV. St. Toad's 3
3
"Beware St. Toad's cracked chimes!" I heard him scream 3
3
As I plunged into those mad lanes that wind 3
3
In labyrinths obscure and undefined 3
3
South of the river where old centuries dream. 3
3
He was a furtive figure, bent and ragged. 3
3
And in a flash had staggered out of sight. 3
3
So still I burrowed onward in the night 3
3
Toward where more roof-lines rose, malign and jagged. 3
3
No guide-book told of what was lurking here - 3
3
But now I heard another old man shriek: 3
3
"Beware St.Toad's cracked chimes!" And growing weak, 3
3
I paused, when a third greybeard croaked in fear: 3
3
"Beware St. Toad's cracked chimes!" Aghast, I fled - 3
3
Till suddenly that black spire loomed ahead. 3
3
XXVI. The Familiars 3
3
John Whateley lived about a mile from town. 3
Up where the hills begin to huddle thick; 3
We never thought his wits were very quick. 3
Seeing the way he let his farm run down. 3
He used to waste his time on some queer books 3
3
3
3
1300 3
3
3
3
He'd found around the attic of his place. 3
Till funny lines got creased into his face. 3
And folks all said they didn't like his looks. 3
3
When he began those night-howls we declared 3
He'd better be locked up away from harm. 3
So three men from the Aylesbury town farm 3
Went for him - but came back alone and scared. 3
They'd found him talking to two crouching things 3
That at their step flew off on great black wings. 3
3
XXVII. The Elder Pharos 3
3
From Leng, where rocky peaks climb bleak and bare 3
3
Under cold stars obscure to human sight. 3
3
There shoots at dusk a single beam of light 3
3
Whose far blue rays make shepherds whine in prayer. 3
3
They say (though none has been there) that it comes 3
3
Out of a pharos in a tower of stone. 3
3
Where the last Elder One lives on alone. 3
3
Talking to Chaos with the beat of drums. 3
3
The Thing, they whisper, wears a silken mask 3
Of yellow, whose queer folds appear to hide 3
A face not of this earth, though none dares ask 3
Just what those features are, which bulge inside. 3
Many, in man's first youth, sought out that glow. 3
But what they found, no one will ever know. 3
3
XXVIII. Expectancy 3
3
I cannot tell why some things hold for me 3
A sense of unplumbed marvels to befall. 3
Or of a rift in the horizon's wall 3
Opening to worlds where only gods can be. 3
There is a breathless, vague expectancy. 3
As of vast ancient pomps I half recall. 3
Or wild adventures, uncorporeal. 3
Ecstasy-fraught, and as a day-dream free. 3
3
It is in sunsets and strange city spires. 3
3
Old villages and woods and misty downs. 3
3
South winds, the sea, low hills, and lighted towns. 3
3
3
3
1301 3
3
3
3
Old gardens, half-heard songs, and the moon's fires. 3
But though its lure alone makes life worth living. 3
None gains or guesses what it hints at giving. 3
3
XXIX. Nostalgia 3
3
Once every year, in autumn's wistful glow. 3
3
The birds fly out over an ocean waste. 3
3
Calling and chattering in a joyous haste 3
3
To reach some land their inner memories know. 3
3
Great terraced gardens where bright blossoms blow. 3
3
And lines of mangoes luscious to the taste. 3
3
And temple-groves with branches interlaced 3
3
Over cool paths - all these their vague dreams shew. 3
3
They search the sea for marks of their old shore - 3
For the tall city, white and turreted - 3
But only empty waters stretch ahead. 3
So that at last they turn away once more. 3
Yet sunken deep where alien polyps throng. 3
The old towers miss their lost, remembered song. 3
3
XXX. Background 3
3
I never can be tied to raw, new things. 3
3
For I first saw the light in an old town. 3
3
Where from my window huddled roofs sloped down 3
3
To a quaint harbour rich with visionings. 3
3
Streets with carved doorways where the sunset beams 3
3
Flooded old fanlights and small window-panes. 3
3
And Georgian steeples topped with gilded vanes - 3
3
These were the sights that shaped my childhood dreams. 3
3
Such treasures, left from times of cautious leaven. 3
Cannot but loose the hold of flimsier wraiths 3
That flit with shifting ways and muddled faiths 3
Across the changeless walls of earth and heaven. 3
They cut the moment's thongs and leave me free 3
To stand alone before eternity. 3
3
3
3
1302 3
3
3
3
XXXI. The Dweller 3
3
It had been old when Babylon was new; 3
None knows how long it slept beneath that mound. 3
Where in the end our questing shovels found 3
Its granite blocks and brought it back to view. 3
There were vast pavements and foundation-walls. 3
And crumbling slabs and statues, carved to shew 3
Fantastic beings of some long ago 3
Past anything the world of man recalls. 3
3
And then we saw those stone steps leading down 3
Through a choked gate of graven dolomite 3
To some black haven of eternal night 3
Where elder signs and primal secrets frown. 3
We cleared a path - but raced in mad retreat 3
When from below we heard those clumping feet. 3
3
XXXII. Alienation 3
3
His solid flesh had never been away. 3
3
For each dawn found him in his usual place. 3
3
But every night his spirit loved to race 3
3
Through gulfs and worlds remote from common day. 3
3
He had seen Yaddith, yet retained his mind. 3
3
And come back safely from the Ghooric zone. 3
3
When one still night across curved space was thrown 3
3
That beckoning piping from the voids behind. 3
3
He waked that morning as an older man. 3
And nothing since has looked the same to him. 3
Objects around float nebulous and dim - 3
False, phantom trifles of some vaster plan. 3
His folk and friends are now an alien throng 3
To which he struggles vainly to belong. 3
3
XXXIII. Harbour Whistles 3
3
Over old roofs and past decaying spires 3
The harbour whistles chant all through the night; 3
Throats from strange ports, and beaches far and white. 3
And fabulous oceans, ranged in motley choirs. 3
Each to the other alien and unknown. 3
3
3
3
1303 3
3
3
3
Yet all, by some obscurely focussed force 3
3
From brooding gulfs beyond the Zodiac's course. 3
3
Fused into one mysterious cosmic drone. 3
3
Through shadowy dreams they send a marching line 3
3
Of still more shadowy shapes and hints and views; 3
3
Echoes from outer voids, and subtle clues 3
3
To things which they themselves cannot define. 3
3
And always in that chorus, faintly blent. 3
3
We catch some notes no earth-ship ever sent. 3
3
XXXIV. Recapture 3
3
The way led down a dark, half-wooded heath 3
3
Where moss-grey boulders humped above the mould. 3
3
And curious drops, disquieting and cold. 3
3
Sprayed up from unseen streams in gulfs beneath. 3
3
There was no wind, nor any trace of sound 3
3
In puzzling shrub, or alien-featured tree. 3
3
Nor any view before - till suddenly. 3
3
Straight in my path, I saw a monstrous mound. 3
3
Half to the sky those steep sides loomed upspread. 3
3
Rank-grassed, and cluttered by a crumbling flight 3
3
Of lava stairs that scaled the fear-topped height 3
3
In steps too vast for any human tread. 3
3
I shrieked - and knew what primal star and year 3
3
Had sucked me back from man's dream-transient sphere! 3
3
XXXV. Evening Star 3
3
I saw it from that hidden, silent place 3
Where the old wood half shuts the meadow in. 3
It shone through all the sunset's glories - thin 3
At first, but with a slowly brightening face. 3
Night came, and that lone beacon, amber-hued. 3
Beat on my sight as never it did of old; 3
The evening star - but grown a thousandfold 3
More haunting in this hush and solitude. 3
3
It traced strange pictures on the quivering air - 3
Half-memories that had always filled my eyes - 3
Vast towers and gardens; curious seas and skies 3
3
3
3
1304 3
3
3
3
Of some dim life - 1 never could tell where. 3
But now I knew that through the cosmic dome 3
Those rays were calling from my far, lost home. 3
3
XXXVI. Continuity 3
3
There is in certain ancient things a trace 3
3
Of some dim essence - more than form or weight; 3
3
A tenuous aether, indeterminate. 3
3
Yet linked with all the laws of time and space. 3
3
A faint, veiled sign of continuities 3
3
That outward eyes can never quite descry; 3
3
Of locked dimensions harbouring years gone by. 3
3
And out of reach except for hidden keys. 3
3
It moves me most when slanting sunbeams glow 3
3
On old farm buildings set against a hill. 3
3
And paint with life the shapes which linger still 3
3
From centuries less a dream than this we know. 3
3
In that strange light I feel I am not far 3
3
From the fixt mass whose sides the ages are. 3
3
3
3
1305 3
3
3
3
Good Saint Nick 3
3
May good St. Nick, like as a bird of night. 3
Bring thee rich blessings in his annual flight; 3
Long by thy chimney rest his pond'rous pack. 3
And leave with lessen'd weight upon his back! 3
3
3
3
1306 3
3
3
3
Hallowe'^en in a Suburb 3
3
The steeples are white in the wild moonlight. 3
3
And the trees have a silver glare; 3
3
Past the chimneys high see the vampires fly. 3
3
And the harpies of upper air. 3
3
That flutter and laugh and stare. 3
3
For the village dead to the moon outspread 3
3
Never shone in the sunset's gleam. 3
3
But grew out of the deep that the dead years keep 3
3
Where the rivers of madness stream 3
3
Down the gulfs to a pit of dream. 3
3
A chill wind blows through the rows of sheaves 3
3
In the meadows that shimmer pale. 3
3
And comes to twine where the headstones shine 3
3
And the ghouls of the churchyard wail 3
3
For harvests that fly and fail. 3
3
Not a breath of the strange grey gods of change 3
3
That tore from the past its own 3
3
Can quicken this hour, when a spectral power 3
3
Spreads sleep o'er the cosmic throne. 3
3
And looses the vast unknown. 3
3
So here again stretch the vale and plain 3
That moons long-forgotten saw. 3
And the dead leap gay in the pallid ray. 3
Sprung out of the tomb's black maw 3
To shake all the world with awe. 3
3
And all that the morn shall greet forlorn. 3
3
The ugliness and the pest 3
3
Of rows where thick rise the stones and brick. 3
3
Shall some day be with the rest. 3
3
And brood with the shades unblest. 3
3
Then wild in the dark let the lemurs bark. 3
And the leprous spires ascend; 3
For new and old alike in the fold 3
3
3
3
1307 3
3
3
3
Of horror and death are penned. 3
For the hounds of Time to rend. 3

Laeta; A Lament 3
3
How sad droop the willows by Zalal's fair side. 3
Where so lately I stray'd with my raven-hair'd bride; 3
Ev'ry light-floating lily, each flow'r on the shore. 3
Folds in sorrow since Laeta can see them no more! 3
3
Oh blest were the days when in childhood and hope 3
With my Laeta I rov'd o'er the blossom-clad slope. 3
Plucking white meadow-daisies and ferns by the stream. 3
As we laugh'd at the ripples that twinkle and gleam. 3
3
Not a bloom deck'd the mead that could rival in grace 3
The dear innocent charms of my Laeta's fair face; 3
Not a thrush thrill'd the grove with a carol so choice 3
As the silvery strains of my Laeta's sweet voice. 3
3
The shy nymphs of the woodlands, the fount, and the plain. 3
Strove to equal her beauty, but strove all in vain; 3
Yet no envy they bore her, while fruitless they strove. 3
For so pure was my Laeta, they could only love! 3
3
When the warm breath of Auster play'd soft o'er the flow'rs. 3
And young Zephyrus rustled the gay scented bow'rs, 3
Ev'ry breeze seem'd to pause as it drew near the fair. 3
Too much aw'd at her sweetness to tumble her hair. 3
3
How fond were our dreams on the day when we stood 3
In the ivy-grown temple beside the dark wood; 3
When our pledges we seal'd at the sanctify'd shrine. 3
And I knew that my Laeta forever was mine! 3
3
How blissful our thoughts when the wild autumn came. 3
And the forests with scarlet and gold were aflame; 3
Yet how heavy my heart when I first felt the fear 3
That my starry-eyed Laeta would fade with the year! 3
3
The pastures were sere and the heavens were grey 3
When I laid my lov'd Laeta forever away. 3
And the river god pity'd, as weeping I pac'd 3
Mingling hot bitter tears with his cold frozen waste. 3
3
3
3
1309 3
3
3
3
Now the flow'rs have return' d, but they bloom not so sweet 3
As in days when they blossom'd round Laeta's dear feet; 3
And the willows complain to the answering hill. 3
And the thrushes that once were so happy are still. 3
3
The green meadows and groves in their loneliness pine. 3
Whilst the dryads no more in their madrigals join. 3
The breeze once so joyous now murmurs and sighs. 3
And blows soft o'er the spot where my lov'd Laeta lies. 3
3
So pensive I roam o'er the desolate lawn 3
Where we wander'd and lov'd in the days that are gone. 3
And I yearn for the autumn, when Zalal's blue tide 3
Shall sing low by my grave and the lov'd Laeta's side. 3

Lines on General Robert Edward Lee 3
3
Si veris magna paratur 3
3
Fama bonis, et se successu nuda remoto 3
3
Inspicitur virtus, quicquid laudamus in ullo 3
3
Majorum, ortuna fuit. 3
3
- Lucan 3
3
Whilst martial echoes o'er the wave resound. 3
And Europe's gore incarnadines the ground; 3
Today no foreign hero we bemoan. 3
But count the glowing virtues of our own! 3
illustrious LEE! around whose honour'd name 3
Entwines a patriot's and a Christian's fame; 3
With whose just praise admiring nations ring. 3
And whom repenting foes contritely sing! 3
When first our land fraternal fury bore. 3
And Sumter's guns alarm'd the anxious shore; 3
When Faction's reign ancestral rights o'erthrew. 3
And sunder'd States a mutual hatred knew; 3
Then clash'd contending chiefs of kindred line. 3
In flesh to suffer and in fame to shine. 3
But o'er them all, majestic in his might. 3
Rose LEE, unrivall'd, to sublimest height: 3
With torturing choice defy'd opposing Fate, 3
And shunn'd Temptation for his native State! 3
Thus Washington his monarch's rule o'erturned 3
When young Columbia with rebellion burn'd. 3
And what in Washington the world reveres. 3
In LEE with equal magnitude appears. 3
Our nation's Father, crown'd with vict'ry bays. 3
Enjoys a loving land's eternal praise: 3
Let, then, our hearts with equal rev'rence greet 3
His proud successor, rising o'er defeat! 3
Around his greatness pour disheart'ning woes. 3
But still he tow'rs above his conquering foes. 3
Silence! ye jackal herd that vainly blame 3
Th' unspotted leader by a traitor's name. 3
If such was LEE, let blushing Justice mourn. 3
And trait'rous Liberty endure our scorn! 3
As Philopoemen once sublimely strove. 3
And earn'd declining Hellas' thankful love; 3
3
3
3
1311 3
3
3
3
So followed LEE the purest patriot's part. 3
3
And wak'd the worship of the grateful heart: 3
3
The South her soul in body'd form discerns; 3
3
The North from LEE a nobler freedom learns! 3
3
Attend! ye sons of Albion's ancient race, 3
3
Whate'er your country, and whate'er your place; 3
3
LEE'S valiant deeds, though dear to Southern song. 3
3
To all our Saxon strain as well belong. 3
3
Courage like his the parent Island won. 3
3
And led an Empire past the setting sun; 3
3
To realms unknown our laws and language bore, 3
3
Rais'd England's banner on the desert shore; 3
3
Crush'd the proud rival, and subdued the sea 3
3
For ages past, and aeons yet to be! 3
3
From Scotia's hilly bounds the paean rolls. 3
3
And Afric's distant Cape great LEE extols; 3
3
The sainted soul and manly mien combine 3
3
To grace Britannia's and Virginia's line 3
3
As dullards now in thoughtless fervour prate 3
3
Of shameful peace, and sing th' unmanly State; 3
3
As churls their piping reprobations shriek. 3
3
And damn the heroes that protect the weak; 3
3
Let LEE'S brave shade the timid throng accost. 3
3
And give them back the manhood they have lost! 3
3
What kindlier spirit, breathing from on high. 3
3
Can teach us how to live and how to die? 3
3

Little Tiger 3
3
Little Tiger, burning bright 3
With a subtle Blakeish Hght, 3
Tell what visions have their home 3
In those eyes of flame and chrome! 3
Children vex thee - thoughtless, gay 3
Holding when thou wouldst away: 3
What dark lore is that which thou. 3
Spitting, mixest with thy meow? 3

Nathicana 3
3
(cowritten with Alfred Galpin) 3
3
It was in the pale garden of Zais; 3
3
The mist-shrouded gardens of Zais, 3
3
Where blossoms the white naphalot. 3
3
The redolent herald of midnight. 3
3
There slumber the still lakes of crystal. 3
3
And streamlets that flow without murm'ring; 3
3
Smooth streamlets from caverns of Kathos 3
3
Where broodth the calm spirits of twilight. 3
3
And over the lakes and the streamlets 3
3
Are bridges of pure alabaster. 3
3
White bridges all cunningly carven 3
3
With figures of fairies and daemons. 3
3
Here glimmer strange suns and strange planets. 3
3
And strange is the crescent Bnapis 3
3
That sets 'yong the ivy-grown ramparts 3
3
Where thicken the dusk of the evening. 3
3
Here fall the white vapours of Yabon; 3
3
And here in the swirl of vapours 3
3
I saw the divine Nathicana; 3
3
The garlanded, white Nathicana; 3
3
The slow -eyed, red-lipped Nathicana; 3
3
The silver-voiced, sweet Nathicana; 3
3
The pale-rob'd, belov'd Nathicana. 3
3
And ever was she my beloved. 3
3
From ages when time was unfashioned 3
3
Now anything fashion'd but Yabon. 3
3
And here dwelt we ever and ever. 3
3
The innocent children of Zais, 3
3
At peace in the paths and the arbours. 3
3
White-crowned with the blest nephalote. 3
3
How oft would we float in the twilight 3
3
O'er flow'r-cover'd pastures and hillsides 3
3
All white with the lowly astalthon; 3
3
The lowly yet lovely astalthon. 3
3
And dream in a world made of dreaming 3
3
The dreams that are fairer than Aidenn; 3
3
Bright dreams that are truer than reason! 3
3
So dreamed and so lov'd we thro' ages. 3
3
3
3
1314 3
3
3
3
Till came the cursed season of Dzannin; 3
3
The daemon-damn'd season of Dzannin; 3
3
When red shone the suns and the planets. 3
3
And red learned the crescent Banapis, 3
3
And red fell the vapours of Yabon. 3
3
Then redden'd the blossoms and streamlets 3
3
And lakes that lay under the bridges. 3
3
And even the calm alabaster 3
3
glowed pink with uncanny reflections 3
3
Till all the carv'd fairies and daemons 3
3
Leer'd redly from the backgrounds of shadow. 3
3
Now redden'd my vision, and madly 3
3
I strove to peer thro' the dense curtain 3
3
And glimpsed the divine Nathicana; 3
3
The pure, ever-pale Nathicana; 3
3
The lov'd, the unchang'd Nathicana. 3
3
But vortex on vortex of madness 3
3
Beclouded my labouring vision; 3
3
My damnable, reddening vision 3
3
That built a new world for my seeing; 3
3
Anew world of redness and darkness, 3
3
A horrible coma call'd living 3
3
So now in this come call'd living 3
3
I view the bright phantons of beauty; 3
3
The false hollow phantoms of beauty 3
3
That cloak all the evils of Dzannin. 3
3
I view them with infinite longing. 3
3
So like do they seem to my lov'd one: 3
3
Yet foul for their eyes shines their evil; 3
3
Their cruel and pitilessevil. 3
3
More evil than Thaphron and Latgoz, 3
3
Twice ill fro its gorgeous concealment. 3
3
And only in slumbers of midnight 3
3
Appears the lost maid Nathicana, 3
3
The pallid, the pure Nathicana 3
3
Who fades at the glance of the dreamer. 3
3
Again and again do I seek her; 3
3
I woo with deep draughts of Plathotis, 3
3
Deep draughts brew'd in wine of Astarte 3
3
And strengthen'd with tears of long weeping. 3
3
I yearn for the gardens of Zais; 3
3
The lovely, lost garden of Zais 3
3
Where blossoms the white nephalot. 3
3
3
3
1315 3
3
3
3
The redolent herald of midnight. 3
The last potent draught am I brewing; 3
A draught that the daemons delight ih; 3
A drught that will banish the redness; 3
The horrible coma call'd living. 3
Soon, soon, if I fail not in brewing. 3
The redness and madness will vanish. 3
And deep in the worm-people'd darkness 3
Will rot the base chains that hav bound me. 3
Once more shall the gardens of Zais 3
Dawn white on my long-tortur'd vision, 3
Andthere midst the vapours of Yabon 3
Will stand the divine Nathicana; 3
The deathless, restor'd Nathicana 3
whose like is not met with in living. 3

(In a letter to Donald Wandrei written August 2, 1927, Lovecraft said that this 3
3
poem was supposed to be a 3
3
"parody on those stylistic excesses which really have no basic meaning". In his 3
3
response ten days later, 3
3
Wandrei said "It is a rare and curious kind of literary freak, a satire too good, so 3
3
that, instead of 3
3
parodying, it possesses, the original." ) 3

3
Nemesis 3
3
Through the ghoul-guarded gateways of slumber. 3
3
Past the wan-mooned abysses of night, 3
3
I have lived o'er my lives without number, 3
3
I have sounded all things with my sight; 3
3
And I struggle and shriek ere the daybreak, being driven to madness with fright. 3
3
I have whirled with the earth at the dawning. 3
3
When the sky was a vaporous flame; 3
3
I have seen the dark universe yawning 3
3
Where the black planets roll without aim. 3
3
Where they roll in their horror unheeded, without knowledge or lustre or name. 3
3
I had drifted o'er seas without ending. 3
3
Under sinister grey -clouded skies. 3
3
That the many -forked lightning is rending. 3
3
That resound with hysterical cries; 3
3
With the moans of invisible daemons, that out of the green waters rise. 3
3
I have plunged like a deer through the arches 3
3
Of the hoary primoridal grove. 3
3
Where the oaks feel the presence that marches. 3
3
And stalks on where no spirit dares rove. 3
3
And I flee from a thing that surrounds me, and leers through dead branches 3
3
above. 3
3
I have stumbled by cave-ridden mountains 3
3
That rise barren and bleak from the plain, 3
3
I have drunk of the fog-foetid fountains 3
3
That ooze down to the marsh and the main; 3
3
And in hot cursed tarns I have seen things, I care not to gaze on again. 3
3
I have scanned the vast ivy-clad palace, 3
3
I have trod its untenanted hall. 3
3
Where the moon rising up from the valleys 3
3
Shows the tapestried things on the wall; 3
3
Strange figures discordantly woven, that I cannot endure to recall. 3
3
I have peered from the casements in wonder 3
At the mouldering meadows around. 3
At the many-roofed village laid under 3
3
3
3
1317 3
3
3
3
The curse of a grave-girdled ground; 3
3
And from rows of white urn-carven marble, I listen intently for sound. 3
3
I have haunted the tombs of the ages, 3
3
I have flown on the pinions of fear. 3
3
Where the smoke-belching Erebus rages; 3
3
Where the jokulls loom snow -clad and drear: 3
3
And in realms where the sun of the desert consumes what it never can cheer. 3
3
I was old when the pharaohs first mounted 3
3
The jewel-decked throne by the Nile; 3
3
I was old in those epochs uncounted 3
3
When I, and I only, was vile; 3
3
And Man, yet untainted and happy, dwelt in bliss on the far Arctic isle. 3
3
Oh, great was the sin of my spirit. 3
3
And great is the reach of its doom; 3
3
Not the pity of Heaven can cheer it. 3
3
Nor can respite be found in the tomb: 3
3
Down the infinite aeons come beating the wings of unmerciful gloom. 3
3
Through the ghoul-guarded gateways of slumber. 3
3
Past the wan-mooned abysses of night, 3
3
I have lived o'er my lives without number, 3
3
I have sounded all things with my sight; 3
3
And I struggle and shriek ere the daybreak, being driven to madness with fright. 3

Ode for July Fourth, 1917 3
3
As Columbia's brave scions, in anger array'd. 3
3
Once defy'd a proud monarch and built a new nation; 3
3
'Gainst their brothers of Britain unsheath'd the sharp blade 3
3
That hath ne'er met defeat nor endur'd desecration; 3
3
So must we in this hour 3
3
Show our valour and pow'r. 3
3
And dispel the black perils that over us low'r: 3
3
Whilst the sons of Britannia, no longer our foes. 3
3
Will rejoice in our triumphs and strengthen our blows! 3
3
See the banners of Liberty float in the breeze 3
3
That plays light o'er the regions our fathers defended; 3
3
Hear the voice of the million resound o'er the leas. 3
3
As deeds of the past are proclaim'd and commended; 3
3
And in splendour on high 3
3
Where our flags proudly fly. 3
3
See the folds we tore down flung again to the sky: 3
3
For the Emblem of England, in kinship unfurl'd. 3
3
Shall divide with Old Glory the praise of the world! 3
3
Bury'd now are the hatreds of subject and King, 3
3
And the strife that once sunder'd an Empire hath vanish'd. 3
3
With the fame of the Saxon the heavens shall ring 3
3
As the vultures of darkness are baffled and banish' d; 3
3
And the broad British sea. 3
3
Of her enemies free. 3
3
Shall in tribute bow gladly, Columbia to thee: 3
3
For the friends of the Right, in the field side by side. 3
3
Form a fabric of Freedom no hand can divide! 3

On Reading Lord Dunsany's Book of 3
Wonder 3
3
3
3
The hours of night unheeded fly. 3
And in the grate the embers fade; 3
Vast shadows one by one pass by 3
In silent daemon cavalcade. 3
3
But still the magic volume holds 3
The raptur'd eye in realms apart. 3
And fulgent sorcery enfolds 3
The willing mind and eager heart. 3
3
The lonely room no more is there - 3
For to the sight in pomp appear 3
Temples and cities pois'd in air 3
And blazing glories - sphere on sphere. 3

On Receiving a Picture of Swans 3
3
"Impromtu verse, or 'poetry' to order, is easy only when approached in the cooly 3
3
prosaic sprit. Given 3
3
something to say, a metrical mechanic like myself can easily hammer the matter 3
3
into technically correct 3
3
verse, substituting formal poetic diction for real inspiration or thought. For 3
3
instance, I lately received a 3
3
post-card bearing the picture of swans on a placid stream. Desiring to reply in 3
3
appropriate verse, I harked 3
3
back to the classic myth of Phaethon and Cygnus, handling it as follows: 3
3
With pensive grace, the melancholy Swan 3
Mourns o'er the tomb of luckless Phaethon; 3
On grassy banks the weeping poplars wave. 3
And guard with tender card the wat'ry grave. 3
Would that I might, should I too proudly claim 3
An Heav'nly parent, or a God-like fame; 3
When flown too high, and dash'd to depths below. 3
Receive such tribute as a Cygnus' woe! 3
The faithful bird, that dumbly floats along. 3
Sighs all the deeper for his want of song. 3
3
"This required about 10 minutes of composition." 3

Pacifist War Song - 1917 3
3
We are the valiant Knights of Peace 3
Who prattle for the Right: 3
Our banner is of snowy fleece, 3
Inscrib'd: "TOO PROUD TO FIGHT!" 3
3
By sweet Chautauqua's flow'ry banks 3
We love to sing and play. 3
But should we spy a foeman's ranks! 3
We'd proudly run away! 3
3
When Prussian fury sweeps the main 3
Our freedom to deny; 3
Of tyrant laws we ne'er complain; 3
But gladsomely comply! 3
3
We do not fear the submarines 3
That plough the troubled foam; 3
We scorn the ugly old machines - 3
And safely stay at home! 3
3
They say our country's close to war 3
And soon must man the guns; 3
But we see naught to struggle for - 3
We love the gentle Huns! 3
3
What though their hireling Greaser bands 3
Invade our southern plains? 3
We well can spare those boist'rous lands. 3
Content with what remains! 3
3
Our fathers were both rude and bold. 3
And would not live like brothers; 3
But we are of a finer mould - 3
We're much more like our mothers! 3

Ode to Selene or Diana 3
3
Immortal Moon, in maiden splendour shine; 3
Dispense thy beams, divine Latona's child. 3
Thy silver rays all grosser things define. 3
And hide harsh Truth in sweet illusion mildl. 3
3
In thy soft light, the city of unrest 3
That stands so squalid in thy brother's glare. 3
Throws off its habit, and in silence blest. 3
Becomes a vision, sparkling bright and fair. 3
3
The modern world,with all its care and pain 3
The smokey streets, the loathsome clanging mills. 3
Face 'neath thy breams, Selene, and again 3
We dream as shepherds on Chaldea's hills. 3
3
Take heed, Diana, of my humble plea; 3
Convey me where my happiness can last. 3
Draw me against the tide of Time's rought sea. 3
And let my sprirt rest amidst the past. 3

3
3
To the Old Pagan Religion 3
3
Olympian gods! how can I let ye go. 3
3
And pin my faith to this new Christian creed? 3
3
Can I resign the deities I know, 3
3
for him who on a cross for man did bleed? 3
3
How in my weakness can my hopes depend 3
On one lone god, tho' mighty be his pow'r? 3
Why can Jove's host no more assistance lend. 3
To Soothe my pain, and cheer my troubled hour? 3
3
Are there no dryads on these wooded mounts 3
O'er which I oft in desolation roam? 3
Are there no naiads in these crystal founts 3
Or nereids upon the ocean foam? 3
3
Fast spreads the new; the older faith declines; 3
The name of Christ resounds upon the air; 3
But my wrack'd soul in solitude repines 3
And gives the gods their last-received pray'r. 3
3
On the Ruin of Rome 3
3
How dost thou lie, O Rome, neath the foot of the Teuton 3
Slaves are they men, and bent to the will of thy conqueror; 3
Wither hath gone, great city, the race that gave law to all nations, 3
Subdu'd the East and the West, and made them bow down to thy consuls. 3
Knew not defeat, but gave it to all who attack'd thee? 3
3
Dead! and replac'd by these wretches who cower in confusion. 3
3
Dead! they who gave us this empire to guard and to live in, 3
3
Rome, thou didst fall from thy pow'r with the proud race that made thee, 3
3
and we, base Italians, enjoy'd what we could not have builded. 3
3
To Pan 3
3
Seated in a woodland glen 3
By a shallow stream 3
Once I fell a-musing, when 3
I was lull'd into a dream. 3
3
3
3
1324 3
3
3
3
From the brook a shape arose 3
Half a man and half a goat. 3
Hoofs it had instead of toes 3
And a beard adorn'd its throat. 3
3
On a set of rustic reeds 3
Sweetly play'd this hybrid man 3
Naught car'd I for earthly needs. 3
For I knew that this was Pan. 3
3
Nymphs and Satyrs gather'd round 3
To enjoy the lively sound. 3
3
All to soon I woke in pain 3
And return'd to haunts of men 3
But in rural vales I'd fain 3
Live and hear Pan's pipes again 3
3
On the Vanity of Human Ambition 3
3
Apollo, chasing Daphen, claim'd his prize 3
But lo! she turn'd to wood before his eyes. 3
More modern swains at golden prizes aim. 3
And ever strive some worldly thing to claim. 3
Yet 'tis the same as in Apollo's case. 3
For, once attain' d, the purest gold seems base. 3
All that men seek's unworthy of the quest. 3
Yet seek they will, and never pause for rest. 3
True bliss, methinks, a man can only find 3
In virtuous life, and cultivated mind. 3

Providence 3
3
Written May 1924 3
3
Where bay and river tranquil blend. 3
3
And leafy hillsides rise. 3
3
The spires of Providence ascend 3
3
Against the ancient skies. 3
3
And in the narrow winding ways 3
3
That climb o'er slope and crest. 3
3
The magic of forgotten days 3
3
May still be found to rest. 3
3
A fanlight's gleam, a knocker's blow, 3
3
A glimpse of Georgian brick - 3
3
The sights and sounds of long ago 3
3
Where fancies cluster thick. 3
3
A flight of steps with iron rail, 3
3
A belfry looming tall, 3
3
A slender steeple, carved and pale, 3
3
A moss-grown garden wall. 3
3
A hidden churchyard's crumbling proofs 3
3
Of man's mortality, 3
3
A rotting wharf where gambrel roofs 3
3
Keep watch above the sea. 3
3
Square and parade, whose walls have towered 3
3
Full fifteen decades long 3
3
By cobbled ways 'mid trees embowered. 3
3
And slighted by the throng. 3
3
Stone bridges spanning languid streams. 3
3
Houses perched on the hill. 3
3
And courts where mysteries and dreams 3
3
The brooding spirit fill. 3
3
Steep alley steps by vines concealed. 3
3
Where small-paned windows glow 3
3
At twilight on a bit of field 3
3
That chance has left below. 3
3
My Providence! What airy hosts 3
3
Turn still thy gilded vanes; 3
3
What winds of elf that with grey ghosts 3
3
People thine ancient lanes! 3
3
The chimes of evening as of old 3
3
Above thy valleys sound. 3
3
3
3
1326 3
3
3
3
While thy stern fathers 'neath the mould 3
Make blest thy sacred ground. 3

Revelation 3
3
In a vale of light and laughter. 3
Shining 'neath the friendly sun. 3
Where fulfilment foUow'd after 3
Ev'ry hope or dream begun; 3
Where an Aidenn gay and glorious, 3
Beckon'd down the winsome way; 3
There my soul, o'er pain victorious, 3
Laugh'd and lingered - yesterday. 3
3
Green and narrow was my valley, 3
Temper'd with a verdant shade; 3
Sun deck'd brooklets musically 3
Sparkled thro' each glorious glade; 3
And at night the stars serenely 3
Glow'd betwixt the boughs o'erhead. 3
While Astarte, calm and queenly. 3
Floods of fairy radiance shed. 3
3
There amid the tinted bowers, 3
Raptur'd with the opiate spell 3
Of the grasses, ferns and flowers. 3
Poppy, Phlox and Pimpernel, 3
Long I lay, entranc'd and dreaming, 3
Pleas'd with Nature's bounteous store. 3
Till I mark'd the shaded gleaming 3
Of the sky, and yearn'd for more. 3
3
Eagerly the branches tearing, 3
Clear'd I all the space above. 3
Till the bolder gaze, high faring, 3
Scann'd the naked skies of Jove; 3
Deeps unguess'd now shone before me. 3
Splendid beam'd the solar car; 3
Wings of fervid fancy bore me 3
Out beyond the farthest star. 3
3
Reaching, gasping, wishing, longing 3
For the pageant brought to sight. 3
Vain I watch'd the gold orbs thronging 3
Round the celestial poles of light. 3
3
3
3
1328 3
3
3
3
Madly on a moonbeam ladder 3
Heav'ns abyss I sought to scale. 3
Ever wiser, ever sadder. 3
As the fruitless task would fail. 3
3
Then, with futile striving sated, 3
Veer'd my soul to earth again. 3
Well content that I was fated 3
For a fair, yet low domain; 3
Pleasing thoughts of glad tomorrows. 3
Like the blissful moments past, 3
Lull'd to rest my transient sorrows, 3
Stil'd my godless greed at last. 3
3
But my downward glance, returning. 3
Shrank in fright from what it spy'd; 3
Slopes in hideous torment burning. 3
Terror in the brooklet's tide: 3
For the dell, of shade denuded 3
By my desecrating hand, 3
'Neath the bare sky blaz'd and brooded 3
As a lost, accursed land. 3
3
3
3

3
The Bride of the Sea 3
3
Black loom the crags of the uplands behind me. 3
Dark are the sands of the far-stretching shore. 3
Dim are the pathways and rocks that remind me 3
Sadly of years in the lost Nevermore. 3
3
Soft laps the ocean on wave-polish'd boulder. 3
Sweet is the sound and familiar to me; 3
Here, with her head gently bent to my shoulder, 3
Walk'd I with Unda, the Bride of the Sea. 3
3
Bright was the morn of my youth when I met her. 3
Sweet as the breeze that blew o'er the brine. 3
Swift was I captur'd in Love's strongest fetter. 3
Glad to be here, and she glad to be mine. 3
3
Never a question ask'd I where she wander'd. 3
Never a question ask'd she of my birth: 3
Happy as children, we thought not nor ponder'd. 3
Glad of the bounty of ocean and earth. 3
3
Once when the moonlight play'd soft 'mid the billows. 3
High on the cliff o'er the waters we stood. 3
Bound was her hair with a garland of willows, 3
Pluck'd by the fount in the bird-haunted wood. 3
3
Strangely she gaz'd on the surges beneath her, 3
Charm'd with the sound or entranc'd by the light: 3
Then did the waves a wild aspect bequeath her. 3
Stern as the ocean and weird as the night. 3
3
Coldly she left me, astonish'd and weeping. 3
Standing alone 'mid the legions she bless'd: 3
Down, ever downward, half gliding, half creeping. 3
Stole the sweet Unda in oceanward quest. 3
3
Calm grew the sea, and tumultuous beating 3
Turn'd to a ripple as Unda the fair 3
Trod the wet sands in affectionate greeting, 3
Beckon'd to me, and no longer was there! 3
3
3
3
1330 3
3
3
3
Long did I pace by the banks where she vanish' d. 3
High cHmb'd the moon and descended again. 3
Grey broke the dawn till the sad night was banish' d. 3
Still ach'd my soul with its infinite pain. 3
3
All the wide world have I search'd for my darling; 3
Scour'd the far desert and sail'd distant seas. 3
Once on the wave while the tempest was snarling, 3
Flash'd a fair face that brought quiet and ease. 3
3
Ever in restlessness onward I stumble 3
Seeking and pining scarce heeding my way. 3
Now have I stray' d where the wide waters rumble. 3
Back to the scene of the lost yesterday. 3
3
Lo! the red moon from the ocean's low hazes 3
Rises in ominous grandeur to view; 3
Strange is its face as my tortur'd eye gazes 3
O'er the vast reaches of sparkle and blue. 3
3
Straight from the moon to the shore where I'm sighing 3
Grows a bright bridge made of wavelets and beams. 3
Frail it may be, yet how simple the trying, 3
Wand'ring from earth to the orb of sweet dreams. 3
3
What is yon face in the moonlight appearing; 3
Have I at last found the maiden that fled? 3
Out on the beam-bridge my footsteps are nearing 3
Her whose sweet beckoning hastens my tread. 3
3
Current's surround me, and drowsily swaying. 3
Far on the moon-path I seek the sweet face. 3
Eagerly, hasting, half panting, half praying. 3
Forward I reach for the vision of grace. 3
3
Murmuring waters about me are closing. 3
Soft the sweet vision advances to me. 3
Done are my trials; my heart is reposing 3
Safe with my Unda, the Bride of the Sea. 3
3

3
The Cats 3
3
Babels of blocks to the high heavens towering 3
Flames of futility swirling below; 3
Poisonous fungi in brick and stone flowering. 3
Lanterns that shudder and death-lights that glow. 3
3
Black monstrous bridges across oily rivers. 3
Cobwebs of cable to nameless things spun; 3
Catacomb deeps whose dank chaos delivers 3
Streams of live foetor that rots in the sun. 3
3
Colour and splendour, disease and decaying. 3
Shrieking and ringing and crawling insane. 3
Rabbles exotic to stranger-gods praying. 3
Jumbles of odour that stifle the brain. 3
3
Legions of cats from the alleys nocturnal. 3
Howling and lean in the glare of the moon. 3
Screaming the future with mouthings infernal. 3
Yelling the Garden of Pluto's red rune. 3
3
Tall towers and pyramids ivy'd and crumbling. 3
Bats that swoop low in the weed-cumber'd streets; 3
Bleak Arkham bridges o'er rivers whose rumbling 3
Joins with no voice as the thick horde retreats. 3
3
Belfries that buckle against the moon totter. 3
Caverns whose mouths are by mosses effac'd. 3
And living to answer the wind and the water. 3
Only the lean cats that howl in the wastes. 3
3
3
3
1332 3

3
The City 3
3
3
3
It was golden and splendid. 3
3
That City of light; 3
3
A vision suspended 3
3
In deeps of the night; 3
3
A region of wonder and glory, whose temples were marble and white. 3
3
I remember the season 3
3
It dawn'd on my gaze; 3
3
The mad time of unreason. 3
3
The brain-numbing days 3
3
When Winter, white-sheeted and ghastly, stalks onward to torture and craze. 3
3
More lovely than Zion 3
3
It shone in the sky 3
3
When the beams of Orion 3
3
Beclouded my eye. 3
3
Bringing sleep that was filled with dim mem'ries of moments obscure and gone 3
3
by. 3
3
Its mansions were stately. 3
3
With carvings made fair. 3
3
Each rising sedately 3
3
On terraces rare. 3
3
And the gardens were fragrant and bright with strange miracles blossoming 3
3
there. 3
3
The avenues lur'd me 3
3
With vistas sublime; 3
3
Tall arches assur'd me 3
3
That once on a time 3
3
I had wander'd in rapture beneath them, and bask'd in the Halcyon clime. 3
3
On the plazas were standing 3
3
A sculptur'd array; 3
3
Long bearded, commanding, 3
3
rave men in their day- 3
3
But one stood dismantled and broken, its bearded face battered away. 3
3
In that city effulgent 3
No mortal I saw. 3
3
3
3
1333 3
3
3
3
But my fancy, indulgent 3
3
To memory's law, 3
3
Linger'd long on the forms in the plazas, and eyed their stone features with awe. 3
3
I fann'd the faint ember 3
3
That glow'd in my mind. 3
3
And strove to remember 3
3
The aeons behind; 3
3
To rove thro' infinity freely, and visit the past unconfin'd. 3
3
Then the horrible warning 3
3
Upon my soul sped 3
3
Like the ominous morning 3
3
That rises in red. 3
3
And in panic I flew from the knowledge of terrors forgotten and dead. 3
3
3
3
1334 3
3
3
3
The Conscript 3
3
I am a peaceful working man, 3
I am not wise or strong. 3
But I can follow Nature's plan. 3
In labour, rest, and song. 3
3
One day the men that rule us all 3
Decided we must die. 3
Else pride and freedom surely fall 3
In the dim bye and bye! 3
3
They told me I must write my name 3
Upon a scroll of death; 3
That some day I should rise to fame 3
By giving up my breath. 3
3
I do not know what I have done 3
That I should thus be bound 3
To wait for tortures one by one 3
And then an unmark'd mound. 3
3
I hate no man, and yet they say 3
That I must fight and kill; 3
That I must suffer day by day 3
To please a master's will. 3
3
I used to have a conscience free. 3
But now they bid it rest; 3
They've made a number out of me. 3
And I must ne'er protest. 3
3
They tell of trenches, long and deep, 3
Fill'd with the mangled slain. 3
They talk till I can scarcely sleep. 3
So reeling is my brain. 3
3
They tell of filth, and blood, and woe; 3
Of things beyond belief; 3
Of things that make me tremble so 3
With mingled fright and grief. 3
3
3
3
1335 3
3
3
3
I do not know what I shall do - 3
Is not the law unjust? 3
I can't do what they want me to. 3
And yet they say I must! 3
3
Each day my doom doth nearer bring; 3
Each day the State prepares; 3
Sometimes I feel a watching thing 3
That stares, and stares, and stares. 3
3
I never seem to sleep - my head 3
Whirls in the queerest way. 3
Why am I chosen to be dead 3
Upon some fateful day? 3
3
Yet hark - some fibre is o'erwrought 3
A giddying wine I quaff - 3
Things seem so odd, I can do naught 3
But laugh, and laugh, and laugh! 3
3
3
3
1336 3
3
3
3
The Garden 3
3
There's an ancient, ancient garden that I see sometimes in dreams. 3
3
Where the very Maytime sunHght plays and glows with spectral gleams; 3
3
Where the gaudy-tinted blossoms seem to wither into grey. 3
3
And the crumbling walls and pillars waken thoughts of yesterday. 3
3
There are vines in nooks and crannies, and there's moss about the pool. 3
3
And the tangled weedy thicket chokes the arbour dark and cool: 3
3
In the silent sunken pathways springs a herbage sparse and spare. 3
3
Where the musty scent of dead things dulls the fragrance of the air. 3
3
There is not a living creature in the lonely space arouna. 3
3
And the hedge-encompass'd d quiet never echoes to a sound. 3
3
As I walk, and wait, and listen, I will often seek to find 3
3
When it was I knew that garden in an age long left behind; 3
3
I will oft conjure a vision of a day that is no more. 3
3
As I gaze upon the grey, grey scenes I feel I knew before. 3
3
Then a sadness settles o'er me, and a tremor seems to start - 3
3
For I know the flow'rs are shrivell'd hopes - the garden is my heart. 3
3
3
3
1337 3
3
3
3
The House 3
3
3
3
'Tis a grove-circled dwelling 3
3
Set close to a hill. 3
3
Where the branches are telling 3
3
Strange legends of ill; 3
3
Over timbers so old 3
3
That they breathe of the dead. 3
3
Crawl the vines, green and cold. 3
3
By strange nourishment fed; 3
3
And no man knows the juices they suck from the depths of their dank slimy bed. 3
3
In the gardens are growing 3
3
Tall blossoms and fair. 3
3
Each pallid bloom throwing 3
3
Perfume on the air; 3
3
But the afternoon sun 3
3
with its shining red rays 3
3
Makes the picture loom dun 3
3
On the curious gaze. 3
3
And above the sween scent of the the blossoms rise odours of numberless days. 3
3
The rank grasses are waving 3
3
On terrace and lawn. 3
3
Dim memories savouring 3
3
Of things that have gone; 3
3
The stones of the walks 3
3
Are encrusted and wet. 3
3
And a strange spirit stalks 3
3
When the red sun has set. 3
3
And the soul of the watcher is fill'd with faint pictures he fain would forget. 3
3
It was in the hot Junetime 3
3
I stood by that scene. 3
3
When the gold rays of noontime 3
3
Beat bright on the green. 3
3
But I shiver'd with cold. 3
3
Groping feebly for light. 3
3
As a picture unroll'd - 3
3
And my age-spanning sight 3
3
Saw the time I had been there before flash like fulgury out of the night. 3

The Messenger 3
3
The thing, he said, would come in the night at three 3
From the old churchyard on the hill below; 3
But crouching by an oak fire's wholesome glow, 3
I tried to tell myself it could not be. 3
3
Surely, I mused, it was pleasantry 3
Devised by one who did not truly know 3
The Elder Sign, bequeathed from long ago. 3
That sets the fumbling forms of darkness free. 3
3
He had not meant it - no - but still I lit 3
Another lamp as starry Leo climbed 3
Out of the Seekonk, and a steeple chimed 3
Three - and the firelight faded, bit by bit. 3
3
Then at the door that cautious rattling came - 3
And the mad truth devoured me like a flame! 3

The Peace Advocate 3
3
(Supposed to be a "pome," but cast strictly in modern metre) 3
3
The vicar sat in the firehght's glow, 3
3
A volume in his hand. 3
3
And a tear he shed for the widespread woe. 3
3
And the anguish brought by the vicious foe 3
3
That overran the land. 3
3
But never a hand for his King raised he. 3
For he was a man of peace; 3
And he car'd not a whit for the victory 3
That must come to preserve his nation free. 3
And the world from fear release. 3
3
His son had buckled on his sword. 3
The first at the front was he. 3
But the vicar his valiant child ignor'd 3
And his noble deeds in the field deplor'd. 3
For he knew not bravery. 3
3
On his flock he strove to fix his will. 3
3
And lead them to scorn the fray. 3
3
He told them that conquest brings but ill; 3
3
That meek submission would serve them still 3
3
To keep the foe away. 3
3
In vain did he hear the bugle's sound 3
That strove to avert the fall. 3
The land, quoth he, is all men's ground. 3
What matter if friend or foe be found 3
As master of us all? 3
3
One day from the village green hard by 3
The vicar heard a roar 3
Of cannon that rival'd the anguish'd cry 3
Of the hundreds that liv'd but wish'd to die 3
As the enemy rode them o'er. 3
3
Now he sees his own cathedral shake 3
3
At the foemen's wanton aim. 3
3
The ancient towers with the bullets quake; 3
3
3
3
1341 3
3
3
3
The steeples fall, the foundations break. 3
And the whole is lost in flame. 3
3
Up the vicarage lane file the cavalcade. 3
And the vicar, and daughter, and wife 3
Scream out in vain for the needed aid 3
That only a regiment might have made 3
Ere they lose what is more than life. 3
3
Then quick to his brain came manhood's thought. 3
3
As he saw his erring course. 3
3
And the vicar his dusty rifle brought 3
3
That the foe might at least by one be fought. 3
3
And force repaid with force. 3
3
One shot - the enemy's blasting fire 3
3
A breach in the wall cuts through. 3
3
But the vicar replies with his wakened ire; 3
3
Fells one arm'd brute for each fallen spire. 3
3
And in blood is born anew. 3
3
Two shots - the wife and daughter sink. 3
Each with a mortal wound. 3
And the vicar, too madden'd by far to think. 3
Rushes boldly on to death's vague brink 3
With the manhood he has found. 3
3
Three shots - but shots of another kind 3
The smoky regions rend. 3
And upon the foemen with rage gone blind, 3
like a ceaseless, resistless, avenging wind. 3
The rescuing troops descend. 3
3
The smoke-pall clears, and the vicar's son 3
His father's life has sav'd. 3
And the vicar looks o'er ruin done. 3
Ere the victory by his child was won. 3
His face with care engrav'd. 3
3
The vicar sat in the firelight's glow. 3
3
The volume in his hand 3
3
That brought to his hearth the bitter woe 3
3
3
3
1342 3
3
3
3
Which only a husband and father can know. 3
And truly understand. 3
3
With a chasten'd mien he flung the book 3
3
To the leaping flames before. 3
3
And a breath of sad relief he took 3
3
As the pages blacken'd beneath his look - 3
3
The fool of peace no more! 3
3
Epilogue 3
3
The reverend parson, wak'd to man's estate. 3
Laments his wife's and daughter's common fate. 3
His martial son in warm embrace enfolds. 3
And clings the tighter to the child he holds: 3
His peaceful notions, banish'd in an hour. 3
Will nevermore his wit or sense devour. 3
But steep'd in truth, 'tis now his nobler plan 3
To cure, yet recognize, the faults of man. 3

The Poe-et^s Nightmare 3
3
A Fable 3
3
Luxus tumultus semper causa est. 3
3
LucuUus Languish, student of the skies. 3
3
And connoisseur of rarebits and mince pies, 3
3
A bard by choice, a grocer's clerk by trade, 3
3
(Grown pessimist through honours long delay'd) 3
3
A secret yearning bore, that he might shine 3
3
In breathing numbers, and in song divine. 3
3
Each day his fountain pen was wont to drop 3
3
An ode or dirge or two about the shop. 3
3
Yet naught could strike the chord within his heart 3
3
That throbb'd for poesy, and cry'd for art. 3
3
Each eve he sought his bashful Muse to wake 3
3
With overdoses of ice cream and cake. 3
3
But though th' ambitious youth a dreamer grew, 3
3
Th' Aonian Nymph delcin'd to come to view. 3
3
Something at dusk he scour'd the heav'ns afar 3
Searching for raptures in the evening star; 3
One night he strove to catch a tale untold 3
In crystal deeps - but only caught a cold. 3
So pin'd LucuUus with his lofty woe. 3
Till one drear day he bought a set of Poe: 3
Charm'd with the cheerful horrors there display's. 3
He vow'd with gloom to woo the Heav'nly Maid. 3
Of Auber's Tarn and Yaanek's slope he dreams. 3
And weaves an hundred Ravens in his schemes. 3
Not far from our young hero's peaceful home. 3
Lies the fair grove wherein he loves to roam. 3
Though but a stunted copse in vacant lot. 3
He dubs it Temp-e, and adores the spot; 3
When shallow puddles dot the wooded plain. 3
And brim o'er muddy banks with muddy rain. 3
He calls them limpid lakes or poison pools, 3
(Depending on which bard his fancy rules.) 3
3
'Tis here he comes with Heliconian fire 3
On Sundays when he smites the Attic lyre; 3
3
3
3
1344 3
3
3
3
And here one afternoon he brought his gloom, 3
Resolv'd to chant a poet's lay of doom. 3
Roget's Thesaurus, and a book of rhymes. 3
Provide the rungs whereon his spirit climbs: 3
With this grave retinue he trod the grove 3
And pray'd the Fauns he might a Poe-et prove. 3
But sad to tell, ere Pegasus flew high. 3
The not unrelish'd supper hour drew nigh; 3
Our tuneful swain th' imperious call attends. 3
And soon above the groaning table bends. 3
Though it were too prosaic to relate 3
Th' exact particulars of what he ate, 3
(Such long-drawn lists the hasty reader skips. 3
Like Homer's well-known catalogue of ships) 3
This much we swear: that as adjournment near'd, 3
A monstrous lot of cake had disappear'd! 3
Soon to his chamber the young bard repairs. 3
And courts soft Somnus with sweet Lydian airs; 3
Through open casement scans the star-strown deep. 3
And 'neath Orion's beams sinks off to sleep. 3
3
Now start from airy dell the elfin train 3
3
That dance each midnight o'er the sleeping plain. 3
3
To bless the just, or cast a warning spell 3
3
On those who dine not wisely, but too well. 3
3
First Deacon Smith they plague, whose nasal glow 3
3
Comes from what Holmes hath call'd "Elixir Pro"; 3
3
Group'd round the couch his visage they deride. 3
3
Whilst through his dreams unnumber'd serpents glide. 3
3
Next troop the little folk into the room 3
3
Where snore our young Endymion, swath'd in gloom: 3
3
A smile lights up his boyish face, whilst he 3
3
Dreams of the moon - or what he ate at tea. 3
3
The chieftain elf th' unconscious youth surveys, 3
3
and on his form a strange enchantment lays: 3
3
Those lips, that lately trill'd with frosted cake. 3
3
Uneasy sounds in slumbrous fashion make; 3
3
At length their owner's fancies they rehearse. 3
3
And lisp this awesome Poe-em in blank verse: 3
3
Aletheia Phrikodes 3
3
Omnia risus et omnia pulvis et omnia nihil. 3
3
3
3
1345 3
3
3
3
Demoniac clouds, up-pil'd in chasmy reach 3
3
Of soundless heav'n, smother'd the brooding night; 3
3
Nor came the wonted whisp'rings of the swamp. 3
3
Nor voice of autumn wind along the moor. 3
3
Nor mutter'd noises of th' insomnious grove 3
3
Whose black recesses never saw the sun. 3
3
Within that grove a hideous hollow lies. 3
3
Half bare of trees; a pool in centre lurks 3
3
That none dares sound; a tarn of murky face, 3
3
(Though naught can prove its hue, since light of day. 3
3
Affrighted, shuns the forest-shadow's banks.) 3
3
Hard by, a yawning hillside grotto breathes 3
3
From deeps unvisited, a dull, dank air 3
3
That sears the leaves on certain stunted trees 3
3
Which stand about, clawing the spectral gloom 3
3
With evil boughs. To this accursed dell 3
3
Come woodland creatures, seldom to depart: 3
3
Once I behold, upon a crumbling stone 3
3
Set altar-like before the cave, a thing 3
3
I saw not clearly, yet from glimpsing, fled. 3
3
In this half-dusk I meditate alone 3
3
At many a weary noontide, when without 3
3
A world forgets me in its sun-blest mirth. 3
3
Here howls by night the werewolves, and the souls 3
3
Of those that knew me well in other days. 3
3
Yet on this night the grove spake not to me; 3
3
Nor spake the swamp, nor wind along the moor 3
3
Nor moan'd the wind about the lonely eaves 3
3
Of the bleak, haunted pile wherein I lay. 3
3
I was afraid to sleep, or quench the spark 3
3
Of the low -burning taper by my couch. 3
3
I was afraid when through the vaulted space 3
3
Of the old tow'r, the clock-ticks died away 3
3
Into a silence so profound and chill 3
3
That my teeth chatter'd - giving yet no sound. 3
3
Then flicker'd low the light, and all dissolv'd 3
3
Leaving me floating in the hellish grasp 3
3
Of body'd blackness, from whose beating wings 3
3
Came ghoulish blasts of charnel-scented mist. 3
3
things vague, unseen, unfashion'd, and unnam'd 3
3
Jostled each other in the seething void 3
3
That gap'd, chaotic, downward to a sea 3
3
Of speechless horror, foul with writhing thoughts. 3
3
3
3
1346 3
3
3
3
All this I felt, and felt the mocking eyes 3
3
Of the curs's universe upon my soul; 3
3
Yet naught I saw nor heard, till flash'd a beam 3
3
Of lurid lustre through the rotting heav'ns. 3
3
Playing on scenes I labour'd not to see. 3
3
Methought the nameless tarn, alight at last. 3
3
Reflected shapes, and more reveal'd within 3
3
Those shocking depths that ne'er were seen before; 3
3
Methought from out the cave a demon train. 3
3
Grinning and smirking, reel'd in fiendish rout; 3
3
Bearing within their reeking paws a load 3
3
Of carrion viands for an impious feast. 3
3
Methought the stunted trees with hungry arms 3
3
Grop'd greedily for things I dare not name; 3
3
The while a stifling, wraith-like noisomeness 3
3
Fill'd all the dale, and spoke a larger life 3
3
Of uncorporeal hideousness awake 3
3
In the half-sentient wholeness of the spot. 3
3
Now glow'd the ground, and tarn, and cave, and trees. 3
3
And moving forms, and things not spoken of. 3
3
With such a phosphorescence as men glimpse 3
3
In the putrescent thickets of the swamp 3
3
Where logs decaying lie, and rankness reigns. 3
3
Methought a fire-mist drap'd with lucent fold 3
3
The well-remember'd features of the grove. 3
3
Whilst whirling ether bore in eddying streams 3
3
The hot, unfinish'd stuff of nascent worlds 3
3
Hither and thither through infinity 3
3
Of light and darkness, strangely intermix'd; 3
3
Wherein all entity had consciousness. 3
3
Without th' accustom'd outward shape of life. 3
3
Of these swift circling currents was my soul. 3
3
Free from the flesh, a true constituent part; 3
3
Nor felt I less myself, for want of form. 3
3
Then clear'd the mist, and o'er a star-strown scene 3
3
Divine and measureless, I gaz'd in awe. 3
3
Alone in space, I view'd a feeble fleck 3
3
Of silvern light, marking the narrow ken 3
3
Which mortals call the boundless universe. 3
3
On ev'ry side, each as a tiny star. 3
3
Shone more creations, vaster than our own. 3
3
And teeming with unnumber'd forms of life; 3
3
Though we as life would recognize it not. 3
3
3
3
1347 3
3
3
3
Being bound to earthy thoughts of human mould. 3
3
As on a moonless night the Milky Way 3
3
In solid sheen displays its countless orbs 3
3
To weak terrestrial eyes, each orb a sun; 3
3
So beam'd the prospect on my wond'ring soul; 3
3
A spangled curtain, rich with twinkling gems. 3
3
Yet each a mighty universe of suns. 3
3
But as I gaz'd, I sens'd a spirit voice 3
3
In speech didactic, though no voice it was. 3
3
Save as it carried thought. It bade me mark 3
3
That all the universes in my view 3
3
Form'd but an atom in infinity; 3
3
Whose reaches pass the ether-laden realms 3
3
Of heat and light, extending to far fields 3
3
Where flourish worlds invisible and vague, 3
3
Fill'd with strange wisdom and uncanny life. 3
3
And yet beyond; to myriad spheres of light. 3
3
To spheres of darkness, to abysmal voids 3
3
That know the pulses of disorder'd force. 3
3
Big with these musings, I survey'd the surge 3
3
Of boundless being, yet I us'd not eyes. 3
3
For spirit leans not on the props of sense. 3
3
The docent presence swell'd my strength of soul; 3
3
All things I knew, but knew with mind alone. 3
3
Time's endless vista spread before my thought 3
3
With its vast pageant of unceasing change 3
3
And sempiternal strife of force and will; 3
3
I saw the ages flow in stately stream 3
3
Past rise and fall of universe and life; 3
3
I saw the birth of suns and worlds, their death. 3
3
Their transmutation into limpid flame. 3
3
Their second birth and second death, their course 3
3
Perpetual through the aeons' termless flight. 3
3
Never the same, yet born again to serve 3
3
The varying purpose of omnipotence. 3
3
And whilst I watch' d, I knew each second's space 3
3
Was greater than the lifetime of our world. 3
3
Then turn'd my musings to that speck of dust 3
3
Whereon my form corporeal took its rise; 3
3
That speck, born but a second, which must die 3
3
In one brief second more; that fragile earth; 3
3
That crude experiment; that cosmic sport 3
3
Which holds our proud, aspiring race of mites 3
3
3
3
1348 3
3
3
3
And moral vermin; those presuming mites 3
3
Whom ignorance with empty pomp adorns. 3
3
And misinstructs in specious dignity; 3
3
Those mites who, reas'ning outward, vaunt themselves 3
3
As the chief work of Nature, and enjoy 3
3
In fatuous fancy the particular care 3
3
Of all her mystic, super-regnant pow'r. 3
3
And as I strove to vision the sad sphere 3
3
Which lurk'd, lost in ethereal vortices; 3
3
Methough my soul, tun'd to the infinite, 3
3
Refus'd to glimpse that poor atomic blight; 3
3
That misbegotten accident of space; 3
3
That globe of insignificance, whereon 3
3
(My guide celestial told me) dwells no part 3
3
Of empyreal virtue, but where breed 3
3
The coarse corruptions of divine disease; 3
3
The fest'ring ailments of infinity; 3
3
The morbid matter by itself call'd man: 3
3
Such matter (said my guide) as oft breaks forth 3
3
On broad Creation's fabric, to annoy 3
3
For a brief instant, ere assuaging death 3
3
Heal up the malady its birth provok'd. 3
3
Sicken' d, I turn'd my heavy thoughts away. 3
3
Then spake th' ethereal guide with mocking mien. 3
3
Upbraiding me for searching after Truth; 3
3
Visiting on my mind the searing scorn 3
3
Of mind superior; laughing at the woe 3
3
Which rent the vital essence of my soul. 3
3
Methought he brought remembrance of the time 3
3
When from my fellows to the grove I stray'd. 3
3
In solitude and dusk to meditate 3
3
On things forbidden, and to pierce the veil 3
3
Of seeming good and seeming beauteousness 3
3
That covers o'er the tragedy of Truth, 3
3
Helping mankind forget his sorry lot. 3
3
And raising Hope where Truth would crush it down. 3
3
He spake, and as he ceas'd, methought the flames 3
3
Of fuming Heav'n revolv'd in torments dire; 3
3
Whirling in maelstroms of revellious might. 3
3
Yet ever bound by laws I fathom'd not. 3
3
Cycles and epicycles of such girth 3
3
That each a cosmos seem'd, dazzled my gaze 3
3
Till all a wild phantasmal flow became. 3
3
3
3
1349 3
3
3
3
Now burst athwart the fulgent formlessness 3
3
A rift of purer sheen, a sight supernal. 3
3
Broader that all the void conceiv'd by man. 3
3
Yet narrow here. A glimpse of heav'ns beyond; 3
3
Of weird creations so remote and great 3
3
That ev'n my guide assum'd a tone of awe. 3
3
Borne on the wings of stark immensity, 3
3
A touch of rhythm celestial reach'd my soul; 3
3
Thrilling me more with horror than with joy. 3
3
Again the spirit mock'd my human pangs. 3
3
And deep revil'd me for presumptuous thoughts; 3
3
Yet changing now his mien, he bade me scan 3
3
The wid'ning rift that clave the walls of space; 3
3
He bade me search it for the ultimate; 3
3
He bade me find the truth I sought so long; 3
3
He bade me brave th' unutterable Thing, 3
3
The final Truth of moving entity. 3
3
All this he bade and offer'd - but my soul. 3
3
Clinging to life, fled without aim or knowledge. 3
3
Shrieking in silence through the gibbering deeps. 3
3
3
3
'*■'*■'*■'*■'*■'*■ 3
3
3
3
Thus shriek'd the young LucuUus, as he fled 3
Through gibbering deeps - and tumbled out of bed; 3
Within the room the morning sunshine gleams. 3
Whilst the poor youth recalls his troubled dreams. 3
He feels his aching limbs, whose woeful pain 3
Informs his soul his body lives again. 3
And thanks his stars - or cosmoses - or such - 3
That he survives the noxious nightmare's clutch. 3
Thrill'd with the music of th' eternal spheres, 3
(Or is it the alarm-clock that he hears?) 3
He vows to all the Pantheon, high and low. 3
No more to feed on cake, or pie, or Foe. 3
And now his gloomy spirits seem to rise. 3
As he the world beholds with clearer eyes; 3
The cup he thought too full of dregs to quaff. 3
Affords him wine enough to raise a laugh. 3
(All this is metaphor - you must not think 3
Our late Endymion prone to stronger drink!) 3
With brighter visage and with lighter heart. 3
He turns his fancies to the grocer's mart; 3
3
3
3
1350 3
3
3
3
And strange to say, at last he seems to find 3
3
His daily duties worthy of his mind. 3
3
Since Truth prov'd such a high and dang'rous goal. 3
3
Our bard seeks one less trying to his soul; 3
3
With deep-drawn breath he flouts his dreary woes. 3
3
And a good clerk from a bad poet grows! 3
3
Now close attend my lay, ye scribbling crew 3
3
That bay the moon in numbers strange and new; 3
3
That madly for the spark celestial bawl 3
3
In metres short or long, or none at all; 3
3
Curb your rash force, in numbers or at tea. 3
3
Nor over-zealous for high fancies be; 3
3
Reflect, ere ye the draught Pierian take. 3
3
What worthy clerks or plumbers ye might make; 3
3
Wax not too frenzied in the leaping line 3
3
That neither sense nor measure can confine. 3
3
Lest ye, like young LucuUus Launguish, groan 3
3
Beneath Poe-etic nightmares of your own! 3

The Rose of England 3
3
At morn the rosebud greets the sun 3
3
And sheds the evening dew. 3
3
Expanding ere the day is done. 3
3
In bloom of radiant hue 3
3
And when the sun his rest hath found, 3
3
Rose-Petals strew the garden round! 3
3
Thus that blest Isle that owns the Rose 3
3
From mist and darkness came, 3
3
A million glories to disclose. 3
3
And spread BRITANNIA'S name; 3
3
And ere Life's Sun shall leave the blue, 3
3
ENGLAND shall reign the whole world through! 3
3
3
3
1352 3
3
3
3
The Wood 3
3
They cut it down, and where the pitch-black aisles 3
Of forest night had hid eternal things. 3
They scaled the sky with towers and marble piles 3
To make a city for their revellings. 3
3
White and amazing to the lands around 3
3
That wondrous wealth of domes and turrets rose; 3
3
Crystal and ivory, sublimely crowned 3
3
With pinnacles that bore unmelting snows. 3
3
And through its halls the pipe and sistrum rang. 3
While wine and riot brought their scarlet stains; 3
Never a voice of elder marvels sang. 3
Nor any eye called up the hills and plains. 3
3
Thus down the years, till on one purple night 3
A drunken minstrel in his careless verse 3
Spoke the vile words that should not see the light. 3
And stirred the shadows of an ancient curse. 3
3
Forests may fall, but not the dusk they shield; 3
So on the spot where that proud city stood. 3
The shuddering dawn no single stone revealed. 3
But fled the blackness of a primal wood. 3
3

3
To Edward John Moreton Drax 3
Plunkelt, Eighteenth Baron Dunsany 3
3
As when the sun above a dusky wold. 3
3
Springs into sight and turns the gloom to gold. 3
3
Lights with his magic beams the dew-deck'd bow'r. 3
3
And wakes to life the gay responsive flow'r; 3
3
So now o'er realms where dark'ning dulness lies. 3
3
In solar state see shining PLUNKETT rise! 3
3
Monarch of Fancy! whose ethereal mind 3
3
Mounts fairy peaks, and leaves the throng behind; 3
3
Whose soul untainted bursts the bounds of space. 3
3
And leads to regions of supernal grace: 3
3
Can any praise thee with too strong a tone. 3
3
Who in this age of folly gleam'd alone? 3
3
Thy quill, DUNSANY, with an art divine 3
3
Recalls the gods to each deserted shrine; 3
3
From mystic air a novel pantheon makes. 3
3
And with new spirits fills the meads and brakes; 3
3
With thee we wander thro' primeval bow'rs. 3
3
For thou hast brought earth's childhood back, and ours! 3
3
How leaps the soul, with sudden bliss increas'd. 3
3
When led by thee to lands beyond the East! 3
3
Sick of this sphere, in crime and conflict old. 3
3
We yearn for wonders distant and untold; 3
3
O'er Homer's page a second time we pore. 3
3
And rack our brains for gleams of infant lore: 3
3
But all in vain— for valiant tho' we strive 3
3
No common means these pictures can revive. 3
3
Then dawns DUNSANY with celestial Hght 3
3
And fulgent visions break upon our sight: 3
3
His barque enchanted each sad spirit bears 3
3
To shores of gold, beyond the reach of cares. 3
3
No earthly trammels now our thoughts may chain; 3
3
For childhood's fancy hath come back again! 3
3
What glitt'ring worlds now wait our eager eyes! 3
3
What roads untrodden beckon thro' the skies! 3
3
Wonders on wonders line the gorgeous ways. 3
3
And glorious vistas greet the ravish'd gaze; 3
3
Mountains of clouds, castles of crystal dreams. 3
3
Ethereal cities and Elysian streams; 3
3
3
3
1354 3
3
3
3
Temples of blue, where myriad stars adore 3
3
Forgotten gods of aeons gone before! 3
3
Such are thine arts, DUNSANY, such thy skill. 3
3
That scarce terrestrial seems thy moving quill; 3
3
Can man, and man alone, successful draw 3
3
Such scenes of wonder and domains of awe? 3
3
Our hearts, enraptur'd, fix thy mind's abode 3
3
In high PEG AN A: hail thee as a god; 3
3
And sure, can aught more high or godlike be 3
3
Than such a fancy as resides in thee? 3
3
Delighted Pan a friend and peer perceives 3
3
As thy sweet music stirs the sylvan leaves; 3
3
The Nine, transported, bless thy golden lyre: 3
3
Approve thy fancy, and applaud thy fire; 3
3
Whilst Jove himself assumes a brother's tone. 3
3
And vows the pantheon equal to his own. 3
3
DUNSANY, may thy days be glad and long; 3
3
Replete with visions, and atune with song; 3
3
May thy rare notes increasing millions cheer. 3
3
Thy name beloved, and thy mem'ry dear! 3
3
'Tis thou who hast in hours of dulness brought 3
3
New charms of language, and new gems of thought; 3
3
Hast with a poet's grace enrich'd the earth 3
3
With aureate dreams as noble as thy birth. 3
3
Grateful we name thee, bright with fix'd renown. 3
3
The fairest jewel in HIBERNIA'S crown. 3

The place where the arts all flourish. 3
Grove Court and Christopher Street. 3

And critics who will not praise. 3
So sing ho for the open spaces. 3
And aesthetes with kindly ways. 3

Waste Paper: A Poem of Profound 3
Insignificance 3
3
3
3
Written 1922 3
3
3
3
Out of the reaches of inimitable night 3
3
The blazing planet grew, and forc'd to life 3
3
Unending cycles of progressive strife 3
3
And strange mutations of undying light 3
3
And boresome books, than hell's own self more trite 3
3
And thoughts repeated and become a blight. 3
3
And cheap rum-hounds with moonshine hootch made tight. 3
3
And quite contrite to see the flight of fright so bright 3
3
I used to ride my bicycle in the night 3
3
With a dandy acetylene lantern that cost $3.00 3
3
In the evening, by the moonlight, you can hear those darkies singing 3
3
Meet me tonight - in dreamland. . . BAH! 3
3
I used to sit on the stairs of the house where I was born 3
3
After we left it but before it was sold 3
3
And play on a zobo with two other boys. 3
3
We called ourselves the Blackstone Military Band 3
3
Won't you come home. Bill Bailey, won't you come home? 3
3
In the spring of the year, in the silver rain 3
3
When petal by petal the blossoms fall 3
3
And the mocking birds call 3
3
And the whippoorwill sings. Marguerite. 3
3
The first cinema show in our town opened in 1906 3
3
At the old Olympic, which was then call'd Park, 3
3
And moving beams shot weirdly thro' the dark 3
3
And spit tobacco seldom hit the mark. 3
3
Have you read Dickens' American Notes? 3

It is the ghost of the Jew I murdered that Christmas day 3

Here's to your ripe old age. 3

When one said to another, "Jack, this message came for you." 3

"It may be from a sweetheart, boys," said someone in the crowd. 3

And here the words are missing. . . but Jack cried out aloud: 3

Where Once Poe Walked 3
3
Eternal brood the shadows on this ground. 3
Dreaming of centuries that have gone before; 3
Great elms rise solemnly by slab and mound. 3
Arched high above a hidden world of yore. 3
Round all the scene a light of memory plays. 3
And dead leaves whisper of departed days. 3
Longing for sights and sounds that are no more. 3
Lonely and sad, a specter glides along 3
Aisles where of old his living footsteps fell; 3
No common glance discerns him, though his song 3
Peals down through time with a mysterious spell. 3
Only the few who sorcery's secret know. 3
Espy amidst these tombs the shade of Poe. 3
